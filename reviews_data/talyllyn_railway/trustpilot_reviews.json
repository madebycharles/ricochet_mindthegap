        "review_text": "What an amazing day on Thursday (21/09/23) riding The Slate Trail in the company of my dear friend & our carriage companions (the Lamberts). All the staff were authentically dressed & what struck me most throughout the entire 5 hour experience as they hopped in and out of carriages to share their knowledge was their pride in & care about their railway & its history. There were stops to be let out , with the beautifully kept steam locomotive & its 1860 original carriages backed up so that riders could video and photograph its approach. Being in a small carriage in a railway cutting meant that the kind of big views you\u2019d maybe get on a good day on the Snowdonia railway we\u2019re missing but there were some pretty waterfalls with the purest water you could imagine. We were given a tour of the engine sheds (working) & access to the museum\nafter which we were served a cream tea which I was so so looking forward to however, and here is where it went south. Nowhere had it been mentioned that the scones were to be fruit and that plain were not an option. I was gutted! What a magic day. I\u2019d highly recommend the day if you are in mid/north wales and in particular we enjoyed the pleasant company of tour guide Mrs Kez Jones.",

The volunteers are always ready to talk of their work, the history of the railway and of the engines. Don't hesitate to ask questions. This would have been a 5 star review but for the grumpy staff in the cafe at Tywyn.",

You can tell immediately you arrive, everyone you meet has a welcoming smile, even when it's raining. \n       However I have to say the on line reservation procedure when it came to paying and adding a donation became a little complex for an old 89 year member who hates computers. I think I managed it in the end, but I still wasn't sure that you were going to benefit by the extra 20% tax refund I declared?\n       Please I have a simple question. As a Heritage member how do I go about increasing my monthly direct debit donation? The railway certainly needs some extra financial help right now!",

We had also pre-booked a hamper each, which was brought to our carriage before the train departed. Each hamper contained a sandwich, crisps, a sausage roll, two mini quiches, a salad bowl, and a bottle of water, which I considered great value for \u00a38.50.

At a cost of \u00a366 for a trip along the whole line for all 6 of us It was a bargain, even more so when you factor in the \u00a35 drinks voucher. \n\nFor me what made it the biggest bargain was that the same family of 6 would have to have paid \u00a3126 for the same length of ride in coaches which where not as nice on the Ffestiniog Railway. \n\nAs a driver on another heritage railway, and steam enthusiasts. I think Talyllyn system for a steam railways in the age of covid is the gold standard of how to do it! \n\nI\u2019d also like to thank the guard on the 14:10 train on Tuesday the 29th of September, as my 2 year old nephew had a little accident after picking up a hot drink. She was so helpful, understanding and sprinted to get ice for him. He left the railway non the worse for ware and with a big smile on his face, like the rest of us :) \n\nThank you Talyllyn Iv Fallen in love with your railway :) \n\n\nMatthew Armstrong of Norwich",

The most surprising thing was the speed with which the item was received.  I'd expected around a week and it took only two or three days.  Then there was the packaging.  I was not at home when the item was delivered by Royal Mail so the postman pushed the item, folded, through my rather small letterbox.  However, because the package was so substantial no damage has been sustained to the contents.  Oh yes, the calendar is fantastic, especially if like me you want to record appointments etc.",
