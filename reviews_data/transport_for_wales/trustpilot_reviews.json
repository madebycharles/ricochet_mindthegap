Some 20 other passengers were also left bewildered too, some with young children.\n\nApparently, the train arrived 90 minutes later than scheduled. \n\nTFW are a disgrace with services constantly running late, all too often with bus replacements, misleading information and trains running with only two coaches causing ridiculous overcrowding.\n\nI dread having to travel by TFW and only do so if all other transport avenues are closed.\n\nThe Board of TFW Wales should be sacked, as looking at the number of negative reviews they receive on this site are diabolical. \n\nAs I write this my Son has just messaged me to his train is severely delayed and will not get home nearly two hours later than the scheduled service!!\n\nUNBELIEVABLE.",

That was too late for cinema so went into cinema app and hit refund.  It just worked.  No option in train app for train ticket refund.  On website it gave number.  The person on there saw that trains had run on his system so sent me to customer care who saw it had not run but said could not refund and I must refund them again.  Else could talk to escalations who do not work Sundays.  They said would put note on file.  Redialed refunds who said no note on file but can see train did not run and will refund.

        "review_text": "If I could give zero stars I would! And where to start with a review for this company - they are an absolute shower of doodoo! \n\nEvery time I\u2019ve booked a ticket, the train has been cancelled - every single time! \n\nThe first time I travelled with them, I got a train to my destination, but then, on the way home, they told us the train was no longer going to our destination stop, so we all had to get out and TFW left us stranded at a train station and weren\u2019t even going to put a replacement coach on for us because they said no coaches would be running at 9pm, but they didn\u2019t seem to care a jot how we were to get home and this was after our train had been delayed at the original departure station for nearly 2 hours!\n\nIf you do actually manage to get a train, there is never a refreshment trolley anymore and apparently this is because they can\u2019t get any staff. Well if they run their business in such an appalling manner, is it any wonder they can\u2019t get staff?\n\nThis company is a nationalised one - it\u2019s not private - and unfortunately, it\u2019s a perfect advertisement for privatisation, which is a real shame, but it\u2019s pointless selling tickets for train services that never run and then having to refund them.\n\nBut it does no good to complain, because no one is listening. TFW couldn\u2019t care less whether you can\u2019t get to work, if you miss an appointment or end up stranded at 9pm in a station with no way home.\n\nTFW do little more than constantly disappoint. They\u2019re completely unreliable, so unfortunately, you end up having to go by car - which completely defeats the object - I want to use public transport for several reasons - not least environmental ones - but that\u2019s impossible when there\u2019s no public transport available to use, on the day.\n\nSack the lot of them and bring back Arriva Trains Wales - because something really needs to be done about this utter shower of \u2026\u2026.",

Not only are trains restricted to 1 an hour but they only have  2 carriages on them which is doubly ridiculous. When the train arrived it was totally rammed and half the people could not get one . Of the half who did , with 1 in 20 in the country having covid at the moment , today transport  for wales did more to spread covid than any other organisation anywhere with people standing squashed up tightly against each other the length of the carriages . With no guarantee of even getting on the next 2 carriage train in an hours time we cut our losses and went for a bus although that journey took 2 hours rather than 30 minutes . Transport for Wales, if they can not deliver anything like a half decent service, ought to just put their hands up and run a dedicated half hourly rail replacement service until such time as they can get rolling stock on the lines .",

From thuggish attendants threatening to fine people for paying with cash (?!) to the fact that they'll be late 4 times out of 5 (if they don't just cut through your stop to meet quotas).\nNow, I bought a railcard in July, and they've since changed the rules and information regarding what you get discounts for, making it useless to me now, I asked an attendant if could be refunded, as I've now spent more on the card than I'll ever get in discounts. He said yes, and apologised for the sudden change in rules, stating there had been a lot of anger anf confusion that morning, I'd just have to contact them to get a discount. After contacting them they essentially told me 'unlucky, not our problem'. Honestly never thought I'd miss Arriva, but here we are. Going to stick to the bus from this point on, just in case I get fined for standing on the train in the wrong way.",

Arrived at 17: 42 - we boarded the train and waited...and waited for about 15 mins. Then a TRW worker came over the Public Address and said that he doesn't know what's happening but there's no driver to take the train onwards to Hereford? Eventually we had to disembark the train and wait for the 18:32 ...which turned up at 18:42 and coupled-up to the earlier train. We boarded it...and waited..and waited. It eventually left at 18:58. I was talking to a passenger who lives in Skipton and he couldn't believe how poor the service is here, the overcrowding and the poor quality of rolling stock. TRW are an absolute joke of a company - I wouldn't trust them to run a bath!! Surely there must be an investigation about how this Company can continue to operate?",

People standing the whole journey from Manchester to Cardiff.  Inadequate provision for luggage - most people had an overnight bag or a suitcase or a rucksack and the luggage racks were full up.  Luggage on the tables, in the aisle, under the tables and even in the one toilet for the whole train.  People packed together standing in the aisle.  One poor woman needed the loo - it took her 15 mins to clamber over luggage, and sleeping dogs and nudge past standing passengers to get to the toilet.  She then had to ask people to take their luggage out so she could get in there to use the loo.  It's an accident waiting to happen - if the driver ever needed to apply the brakes, people and luggage would go flying. I'm not a wheelchair user, but I can't see how a wheelchair could get on that train.  As a disabled person, I was lucky to get a seat and was very cramped, with my luggage on the table in front of me and someone else's luggage underneath the table.  By the time I got to Cardiff, I was in agony.  Terrible.  Like the London tube in rush hour, but for a 2.75 hour journey.",
