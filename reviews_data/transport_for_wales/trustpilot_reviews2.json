        "review_text": "Caught 11.52 train from Pontyclun to Cardiff 12th April, 2024.  As our \u201cesteemed\u201d WAG is continually urging us to use public transport we thought we would try to be public spirited. \n\nCouldn\u2019t get machine to work at station but at least we could get on and plenty of room in carriage (two carriage  train). Waited to purchase a ticked on board.  Saw two young railway staff on board chatting to each other at entrance/exit doors. Then saw ticket collector ( yes it WAS a ticket collector) stroll past to join them, collecting no fares on the way.  I tried to get his attention but the three continued chatting, totally ignored me. Relatively short journey so by the time we reached Cardiff the ticket collector had disappeared down the train!!! I asked the 2 remaining staff what I could do about a ticket. Had a metaphorical shrug with the reply \u201cwe\u2019re only here to watch doors and see to passengers, not deal with tickets \u201c!  I asked why the ticket collector didn\u2019t collect the fare from my husband and myself .  The response - \u201che was too busy and it was too crowded , you\u2019ll have to pay when you get off\u201d.  Absolute rubbish!! it was NOT busy, our carriage was about half full. Most of the time in that short journey the ticket collector spent chatting to the other two railway staff, totally ignoring the passengers. \n\nWe then had to join a long queue to pay for our fares.  All because one of your staff couldn\u2019t be bothered to carry out his job.  Perhaps your, probably very handsomely paid, staff should do the job they are paid for.  May make for efficiency and customer satisfaction.  Unfortunately,  judging from the rest of the reviews, that doesn\u2019t seem to be TFW highest priority!    \n\n\nUpdate - As can be from TFW (Holly) reply, \u201cthey care about their staff and won\u2019t discuss them online\u201d My complaint was in essence about the general decline in staff attitude towards passengers.  Viewing them as a nuisance and an inconvenience.  Perhaps TFW should start caring about their customers as well as their staff!!",

How is anyone supposed to be able to rely on this service? The only other option is 1.5 hours on the bus, at a similar price, and is equally if not more unreliable. This morning when I left for work everything was running on time, yet when I checked online my train was running almost 50 minutes late. I have had to cancel an appointment I have had for months, all because TfW cannot provide a timely service.

It's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt . On the outward bound from Carmarthen the trains are filthy and every time we get on ther is always some drunks onboard but nobody says anything because they would just get violent. On one occasion the person on the coffee trolley even sold them more alcohol and wished that he could joint them. This has got to be the worse train company about.I have only travelled on Great western railways once and it was heaven . Clean trains ,good staff and no rowdy passengers it was heaven. TFW need to get there act together.",

The following trains are always crammed with passengers due to lack of carriage space, and more than once I've been worried about the ability to load my bike in for a journey. With the amount of money myself and everyone else is paying for this service, it is ridiculous how unreliable this service is. If a train isn't cancelled it's likely delayed. A couple week's ago, we arrived into a station, on our way from Birmingham to Cardiff and were just told the train was ending there, no further explanation and staff knew nothing. I feel bad for the staff getting the flak for these cancellations and delays when it could be resolved by having more trains, more carriages, or better maintenance standards.",

What a way to run a business- no timescales, no accountability to paying customers! Can't believe that they charge around \u00a3100 for people to stand 3 hours on this service. I only travel 20 minutes on it and that's more than enough to ruin my day.\n\nUpdate - October 2023 - still two carriages since February 2023 (very occasionally 3) and the 175s have all disappeared.

No access to any toilet and then all the staff left and the station closed and we were left waiting in the dark on our own.\n\nI have since been back and forth with customer services to obtain a refund for my journey considering the shocking state of the train service and not actually get the train back, only to be told they don\u2019t have records of the train being cancelled!!

However as of October 2023, the curse of 2 carriages continues on most routes, and there were more scenes of chaos at Chester today. Does anyone really believe some new carriages are going to fix this mess?\n\nClearly the TfW leadership do not know how to run a railway.  There is no resilience, innovation, forward thinking, and everything this organisation does seems perfectly orchestrated to make life as awful as possible for their customers. That they can demand eighty pounds for a return ticket from Chester to Cardiff and expect people to stand all the way is just rubbing salt in the wounds. Cancellations and closures of whole lines are now routine - it seems that TfW feel inconvenienced by running trains when they can simply cancel them instead. Where is the accountability for this shambles? \n\nAmazingly, sidings at Chester, Wrexham, Holyhead and also Telford have numerous TfW trains sitting doing nothing. Does anyone feel like getting these into service or is that too much?\n\nI didn't think anything could be worse than the days of Arriva Trains Wales, but nationalisation of the network in Wales has been the total disaster that many predicted.",

Minutes later told to disembark, no conductor. Everyone told to go to platform 2 for a train, then, we were told to get back on previous train!!! We set off for Carmarthen all cooped up and uncomfortable. Stopped at Swansea, a suitcase fell off the train THEN a very elderly lady fell OFF the train onto another lady, both left lying on the platform! Train driver stopped got out conductor checking train door first aid wheelchair got for lady paperwork exchanged. Then train set off again. Meanwhile autistic grandchild became hysterical. Got to Carmarthen half hour late, Tenby train driver wouldn\u2019t wait and pulled out. Station Manager tried to get coaches all are out on school runs!! So another hour and a half wait for a train to Tenby. No facilities vending machines tea coffee at Carmarthen. Finally, the Station Manager found us a coach. It was so horrendous we decided to forgo our return train tickets on 21 and travel with NATIONAL EXPRESS which are brilliant. Never again will I travel TFW!!!! Zero Stars!!!",

They don't deserve a pay rise but rather a pay cut. Wouldn't pay them \u00a32 per hour with the delays, cancellations and strikes. Then they have the nerve to charge extortionate prices for the unreliable and awful service. If they worked for any other company they would be sacked. Which to be fair would seem the best solution. I'd happily pay \u00a310 per hour to hire smackhead Kev down the road to drive the train, he'd fly down them tracks 400mph off his gourd on spice and you'd be at your location in approximately 2 minutes. Seems a better option than the muppets who want to go on strike every working day if you ask me. Wanted to go to London for my birthday but can't do that now because they are striking so thank you for ruining my birthday! B*st*rds. Oh, and if you do happen to get a train bet you there won't be enough carriages so you probably can't get on if it's busy, your only option is to sit on top the carriage like they do in India but the staff will shout at you for that, which is quite funny tbh because half of them their teeth are social distancing.

The train had TfW on the side, all staff had TfW uniforms and I was travelling into Wales so all announcements were in Welsh as well as English. I appealed the decision as they indeed were the train operator but never had a reply and the 10days passed so I'll probably get nothing back.

Then we had the train from Crewe to Cardiff (no problems) we got into Cardiff, and we were going to get the 19:11 train from Cardiff to Abercynon (this train was cancelled) now we're waiting for the 19:43 train to Abercynon from Cardiff which had now been delayed (by how long we don't know).

        "review_text": "Incompetent organisation. Travelled recently from Manchester to Leominster. Trains seriously overcrowded. No seat reservations (current company policy). No refreshment trolley or access to toilets due to passengers standing and sitting in aisle and lobby areas. Guard notable by their absence. Recommend driving (if possible) until franchise is awarded elsewhere.\n\nUpdate19th January 2023: I wrote to the Chairman of TfW on 31/10/22 to complain about my awful journey. Finally received a response on 17/1/23. Rather demonstrates the contempt of this company towards their fare paying customers. I was simply pointed towards the 'capacity checker' for future journeys. So, rather than tackle the real problem, TfW simply sets up a website! Next franchise operator please.\n\nI also requested (under The Freedom of Information Act) the number of times that TfW trains guards have prevented passengers boarding trains because of overcrowding. The response - '...typically we do not deny boarding a service given there is no legal capacity cap on trains. If a customer is happy to board a service we would not look to deny them access....'\n\nSo, board a TfW train at your own risk....",

They cancel trains too often but I also dread getting on them when they are running because they put on just 2 carriages between Crewe and Shrews, so it is always jam packed, very hard to get a seat and uncomfortably hot! \nThe seats and tables are so tiny, they seem to be built for elves or goblins rather than humans! \n\nI\u2019ve travelled by train a lot over the past 20 years and I can say without a doubt that TFW is the worst train \u2018service\u2019 I have ever experienced. \nI utterly despise travelling with them. \nIt beggars belief that these incompetent fools manage such an important service.

Guess what, even the first train out was 12 minutes late. Missed connection.\nI have travelled midweek journeys to Manchester and because trains have been running so late have been dumped off at Wilmslow because they were terminating the service.\nMost recent journey was Sunday 10th December from Wilmslow to Shrewsbury after coming from Manchester Airport. Train was 18 minutes late on arrival and dangerously overcrowded. Usual 2 carriages. Excuse given this time was that it was late because of a high volume of trains in for repair?? You couldn\u2019t script it.\nUsual one is staff shortages. Many working people would give their high teeth to work on the railways especially on TFW as they are higher paid than other rail employees because they are paid by Welsh Government. However, you need to be related or know someone to get anywhere near a job with them.\nI have had dozens of lousy experiences travelling with this absolute shambles of a train company.\nI remember when they took over from Arriva and announced that they would improve services in Wales and England. What a joke. Arriva weren\u2019t the best but compared to these they were outstanding.\nThey need stripping of the franchise. TFW is not fit for purpose.\nNB Just had a response from TFW saying due to recent storms trains are in for repair hence affected services and cancelled trains.\nWhilst I accept the current situation they have been cancelling trains regularly for the last two years and have not put appropriate number of carriages on busy routes at peak times.\nWhen catching trains in Shrewsbury now towards West Midlands I prefer to pay a little bit extra to travel with West Midlands Trains as opposed to TFW cattle wagons.",

        "review_text": "As I departed the train, I was shocked to see at least 10 (maybe more) TfW staff at this usually unmanned station. We were asked to show our tickets. Although I offered to pay for a ticket, I was horrified to be asked to fill in a form instead, giving them my name, address, date of birth etc, as well as them taking a photo of my ID. This is because it is apparently an offence to travel without a ticket, even if you\u2019re willing to pay. Bizarre, as manned stations in the past have allowed me to buy a ticket after getting off the train, before letting me through the barriers, and I have been allowed to buy tickets from the conductor on the train since I began taking the train, well over a decade ago. Seems like very mixed messages to me. I was given a notice, telling me to pay for the price of a single ticket, apparently with 21 days to pay. My question is: wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to just let me buy a ticket there and then, as I was more than happy to do, rather than them choosing to potentially wait up to 3 weeks? Overall, instead of paying \u00a37.80 for a return, I had to pay \u00a312.80 for effectively 2 singles.\n\nI\u2019d also like to complain about the man who said \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse, mate\u201d, in a rather condescending tone. I told him that I usually buy a ticket off the conductor (who didn\u2019t check), to which he didn\u2019t respond, walking off instead. I felt like a naughty schoolboy who hadn\u2019t done his homework. Disgusting bully tactics.",

        "review_text": "** PITYFUL  RESPONSE FROM HOLLY **\n THEIR CUSTOMER CARE IS A WASTE OF SPACE. I found out LAST WEEK that the FAULTY TRAIN is still in in operation.  The doors got stuck at a different station this time. Now WHAT does this tell you about TFW attitude towards passenger safety ??? I have reported this 2nd incident to RAIL SAFETY BOARD already. ***\n** END OF UPDATE **\n11/07/2023  >> 12.56 To Manchester Incident. Hereford Station..\nAt all costs AVOID trains run by TFW. They are Dangerous, Mechanically and Electrical. A short time back.passengers including myself were trapped in the doors at Hereford train station. When train arrived, the doors opened only for approx 10-15 SECONDS. Then they closed trapping people still getting off and ones getting on..One parent had her baby trapped half in and half out the door . Baby could have been crushed to death. The train driver just  stood outside just staring as passengers were screaming and shouting to open the doors. My shoulder is now mangled because of it and I will no longer be able to drive for a living any more. TFW seem to think it is funny and pushing the incident under the carpet. Rail Safety Board have been informed about the incident and I am now suing for hundreds of thousands due to lost revenue at work and permanent disability to my shoulder. IF you were also on that train , please put in your compensation claim to strengthen the case against TFW. They need to be shut down for safety reasons and fined Millions by safety board . It was clear their drivers and guards are not trained and probably had all been sacked by other rail companies due to their danger to the public and negligence. STAY CLEAR OF TFW. TRAINS ARE NOT FIT FOR PASSENGERS SAFETY !!!  The company shrug safety !!!",

I told a tfl officer \"Sorry, I lost my zip card and applied for a newone\" kindly. He said with ignorance\n \" ok but you know you need to buy a ticket right?\" I stated \" no i didnt know \" because i didnt know that.  The officer with his intimadating voice said \" go back and think about what you said was right or wrong\". At that moment i felt scared and was about to cry, mind you I'm 13 and a muslim girl it is a bit hard to scare me. I didnt know if it was islamaphobia or racism. Although i was scared i said \" sorry i didnt know that i just wanted to inform you that i am going with my dad in his oyster\" He kept on saying to buy a ticket. Then he said to either go buy a ticket or go by bus. Then i tried buying a ticket with my dad and it was a full \u00a34.80  or something like that, in the end i had to go by a bank card.\nThere was a black girl after who was talking to him. He was so nice to her.\nEdit: Thank you Nia. Its alright this happened a long time ago and u shouldn't be the one apologising rather it should be that officer.",

        "review_text": "Update on my earlier experience:  After the lack of response from Transport for Wales, I took the case to the Rail Ombudsman.  The result, once they got involved, was a full refund of all fares paid + \u00a340 in travel vouchers.  I would recommend anyone else who has been subjected to the dreadful service offered by this company to do the exact same thing.  \n\n1st Class tickets were purchased on 29th November 2022 for journeys between Chester and Bath Spa via Newport on the 6th February and from Bath Spa to Chester on the 8th February.  On the 6th February our train was supposed to be a loco hauled set of coaches including a first class carriage.  What turned up was a 3 coach unit with no 1st class.  This broke down somewhere between Craven Arms and Ludlow where a man had to be sent out to it in a taxi to fix it.  We arrived at Newport 2 hours late and so missed our onward connection.  The only alternative at Newport was another unit with no 1st class.  The return journey on the 8th February was considerably worse.  At Newport I checked with station staff that the train would include 1st class and offer dinner. I was assured that it would.  We were looking forward to our dinner in 1st class accommodation.  What turned up 30 minutes late was a 2-car unit.  It was filthy and noisy.  There was no heat, no wifi, no first class, no room.  It staggered as far as Chester and then was taken out of service.  I have tried to claim my money back but got no response from Transport for Wales.  The guard on the 8th, who was unable to fix the lack of heat in the unit, said the management of Transport for Wales are a total shambles.  I would have to say that I agree with him.  And add that they took my money under false pretenses.",

        "review_text": "The wonders of Rail travel in Wales.\nReason for travel, to visit my brother.\nUsing rail travel to complete the journey from Cardiff to Wrexham return. Was travelling on the 9:22 from Cardiff Central to Wrexham General,  This left at 10:10, due to issues with the new train and the Canton Depot. the departure platform was changed 4 times before leaving the station. This was the Holyhead train, but was now stopping at Bangor because of fault with the train. Finally arrived at 12:35 in Wrexham.\n\nI was also booked on the return journey at 18:37, luckily at 16:50 I noticed that this train was cancelled (was this the same train as the morning?), I had picked this train as it was a direct train.\n\nAs the next train was an hour later with a change at Shrewsbury, I could not trust this being late/cancelled as I would have missed  the last train to Caerphilly.\n\nI was able to get to Wrexham Station to check for alternatives and the staff were polite and friendly. I was advised that my ticket would be valid on the earlier train, so I caught the 17:45 to Birmingham International and then swap to the Manchester - Cardiff train at Shrewsbury.\n\nOn this train the conductor checked my ticket and said my ticket was invalid on this train, but because my train had been cancelled he would allow it, as if it was my fault. No seat on this train as it was busy and 15 minutes late arriving. When we got to Shrewsbury everyone was told to get off the train as it was faulty. They had to get on a replacement train, while I waited for the Cardiff bound train, on a cold windy platform with no chance of a hot drink, as both the Wrexham and Shrewsbury Cafes has closed. The train arrived and I was able to get a seat, on a very cold train for the 2 and a half hour journey to Cardiff, no refreshment trolley (there had been one on the way up).\n\nThe final leg of the journey was from Cardiff to Aber/Caerphilly, but it was a bus replacement service because of line issues they had after maintenance. So my journey continued via the Merthyr Train to Taffs Well, where I managed to get a lift home by car. \n\nThis did highlight the issues of TFW, and the Welsh Government plans for all Wales transport links, As I travelled to Taffs Well I saw the TFW Transport Hub that is being built there at incredible cost and you cannot get a handful of trains to run successfully to North Wales, but South Wales will have nice shiny rolling stock and stations. Luckily I live in South Wales. Next time I will drive!",

        "review_text": "This company is the pits when it comes to its main line services I.E South Wales to Manchester Piccadilly services Passenger 1A services , I use the Crewe to Cardiff services 2-3 times a week whilst travelling from Glasgow to Cardiff Central and you can almost Guarantee whilst waiting for the TFW train to come into Crewe station (station changing point towards Cardiff Central) around peak times 16.30-18.30 the company uses a 2 Car Class 150 units for the over 200 mile journey at reduced speeds as the 150 units are usually seen on the valley/Local South wales lines , The train is always Packed & overcrowded as they have not got the capacity to\nFit in the people, Class 150 Old 2 car units with uncomfortable seats for the long journey\nOn A1 passenger services, Very rarely on board the train are there any facilities for even for the lightest refreshment Tea/Coffee, All I hear from TFW we have new trains lots of them but unfortunately the company are still using these awful Class 150 & even 2x Class 153 units coupled up together on this long distance service, At present the companys Class 197,231 & 756 flirt trains are only deployed on local & minor routes and were now almost at the end of May 2023. Most of TFW new class 197 trains are stored at various places around the UK including Crewe which has 10-12 complete units in storage , Why don\u2019t they start training drivers to use these new trains on there main line services instead of making us all suffer with 40 Year old units which are now at the end off there life & definitely had there day . In my my estimation it is the UK worst rail service at the present time and someone in TFW needs their rear end kicked & needs to start thinking about their paying customers either that or change there name to \u2018The Pits rail services\u2019 Appalling",

Is this the TFW we get? Surely this is a severe breach of protocol and health and safety of which I will be logging an official complaint and speaking to the Welsh transport secretary and also health and safety you are an utter disgrace but quite happily hold your hand out to rob people of money and provide a substandard service I for one WILL NEVER travel on a TFW service again ",

There were crowds of people waiting for this train at New Street and a good number of them were not able to board.\n\nThey did the same thing for the rugby in Cardiff earlier this year when people were forced to stand shoulder to shoulder in a 150 all the way from Anglesey. Charging people for that third world service is disgusting.  There are trains available for hire for these special events, especially when you have as much advanced warning of a major sporting event, but of course TfW have no interest in doing that because they do not give a hoot about their passengers. You have to wonder why these people chose a career in the rail industry.\n\nAnd then come their arrogant press releases after people complain about overcrowding where they take no responsibility whatsoever and never explain why their trains are so small.",

I'm wondering if either Owen or Meg will be brave enough to come back to me with a human response rather than with the trite copy and paste, stock standard response, as they seem to have done to all the other complaints from other rightly shocked and disgusted customers of TFW...?\n\nI really do pity both of these poor s ods having to make their mealy mouthed apologies on behalf of quite possibly the worst run rail franchise in Britain. Which by default means the worst in Europe.\n\n Of course,it has to be the Welsh franchise that suffers that ignominious title...THE WORST RAIL FRANCHISE IN BRITAIN. \n\nFollowing on from that other complete clusterf uck train company Arriva Trains Wales. \n\nWhen we landed with this useless company we were assured that they would be better than that other useless lot - Arriva. TFW spent many millions of pounds assuring us of that.\n\nHow anyone could rival those incompetents for a complete lack of efficiency, travel service and customer is mind blowing. But they surpass them in their shoddy, unprofessional and disgraceful service with flying colours.\n\nTelling people that they could use the next available service when a service is cancelled with minutes notice or even none at all is a sick joke - especially late at night when there is no 'later service'. \n\nTelling people that they do not take these decisions lightly when it is a continual occurrence is also complete garbage. It's precisely because it is so easy to do that you do it. If you were fined heavily for doing so, you wouldn't do it. Simples.\n\nI could go on but I have better things to do with my time. Take a really long look at yourselves TFW....NO, A REALLY, REALLY, LONG LOOK AT YOURSELVES.  \nLook at your Trust Pilot score out of 5...and consider that we HAVE TO GIVE YOU A MINIMUM SCORE OF 1 BECAUSE IT WONT LET US GO ANY LOWER. \n\nYour score currently is 1.3 out of 5 currently. You can't even raise your score to be a full point above a completely bloody useless company - don't bother to try and use us - best off crawling on your knees over broken glass to get to your destination. I'd love to see that as your next slogan on your marketing.  Because it's the truth.\n\nThat's how bad you are. \n\n(Take it away Meg or Owen) The floor is yours.....",

BUT surprise surprise ..T4W CANCELLED 3 hours before I was supposed to catch the train ( obviously not enough profit making on said train ) and to add insult to injury AS the ticket was a rail sale it would not allow me to use it on the earlier train which was the 14-06pm from Bangor gwynedd to Birmingham international direct SO HAD TO BY ANOTHER TICKET WHICH COSTED ME \u00a329.30!!! With my VETERANS rail card !! It also costed me half a day\u2019s annual leave due to having to leave 2 hours earlier , and also having to cancel and rearrange transport from Birmingham international adding more cost ! This is not the first time and I am completely sick of your pathetic poor service !! Any person with a brain please STAY away from T4W , catch a bus , pay for a taxi , Fly , or even DRIVE whatever you do \u2026 avoid T4W at all costs !! You have been warned !

        "review_text": "Last train from Wrexham to Chester cancelled at short notice, no rail replacement, no one to speak to at the station, no call centre to be reached, message on website unanswered - even today, one month on.  Had to call a taxi myself - 2-hour wait in Wrexham in the middle of winter.\n\nStill waiting for refund and delay compensation - more than a month now. \n\nTfW have made the conscious choice not to man a call centre in the evening when stranded passengers most need it, and they are failing their own response times for complaints.  In the meantime I'm left out of pocket.\n\nThis is even with the significantly reduced passenger volume while the Covid situation continues - this will only get worse once more people start using the trains again. \n\nComplaint reference is TfWRS-20211211-ABB raised 11 December 2021, still unresolved today 6 Feb 2022.  I haven't even got the money I was forced to spend on a taxi, nor the delay compensation I'm legally entitiled to, not to mention anything to acknowledge the distress and danger caused to me. \n\n\n*** Update 4 Feb ***\n\nStill no response, nor compensation from TfW.  The company has chosen to leave me no option but to take this complaint to the ombudsman, causing further unnecessary work, time lost and upset to me.  It is now nearly two months since I made this complaint. TfW are clearly simply hoping that customers give up seeking to recover the costs TfW's conscious and deliberate decisions to run a substandard service have caused them.\n\nUpdate 23 February.\n\nStill no response from TfW, let alone the compensation I'm due as a statutory right, not to think of an attempt to address the damage and cost they've caused me. \n\nChasing a response on their Facebook page yielded the advice from Owen that their system \"didn't pick up the e-mail I'd sent in response\" to their request to re-supply the tickets (which I'd already sent in with my initial contact) and that the case handler would be asked to look at this.  But this was three days ago, I have received - nothing, no response, no acknowlegement, no status update, nothing.\n\nUpdate 8 March\n\nAlmost a quarter of a year after the initial complaint, still no resolution, not a penny in statutory compensation for the delays, not a penny in compensation for the outlay for the taxi - a clear violation of TfW's contractual duties.  An e-mail to the CEO James Price from 1 March only yielded a response after chasing - the response fails to even correctly summarise the content of the complaint, and needless to say, hasn't led to a resolution or TfW complying with their legal duty to compensate me either.\n\nUpdate 9 March\n\nI have today received, in the post, a letter dated 7 March.  This contains: the promise to refund the taxi costs and to pay the compensation for the delay I am legally entitled to.  This money hasn't been paid into my bank account yet.  The letter also contains a \u00a310 voucher - a piece of paper that costs TfW nothing.  This is what TfW think of their passengers.  The letter contains no information about any lessons learnt or improvements made as a result.  Initially TfW had informed me that no replacement bus service had been sourced (\"Looking at the notes from our Control Team, replacement transport was attempted to be sourced however due to a lack of availability we were unable to provide any.\"), but in the letter now the same TfW representative claims that a replacement service was organised - failing to comment that I was sent away from the station by a builder working for TfW, as the company had taken the conscious decision not to have any staff present themselves, and also made the conscious choice to make themselves unavailable via telephone or their website.\n\n*** Update 18 March ***\n\nI notice that Owen from TfW has made the conscious choice to comment on reviews submitted later than this, and to say nothing about the utter contempt with which TfW has treated me and my complaint.  I notice that he advises passengers that TfW \"will organise taxis\", knowing full well that this is not what TfW have done in my case, and knowing full well that TfW have told me there was nothing wrong with their conscious choice not to assist passengers stuck in Wrexham at night like in my case.",

I was approached instead by a outside conductor who gave me a notice worded as if I was a ticket dodger and criminal.

        "review_text": "Me and my mum were absolutely furious yesterday as we were getting the train back from Conwy to Chester, our plan being to get another train back from Chester to Liverpool, which left 15 minutes after we arrived at Chester station. However, our first train back from Conwy ended up being delayed by 10 minutes, which was made all the more infuriating as they kept reducing the delay on the board so it was only 5 minutes late, only for it to go back to being 10 minutes late again when it actually arrived, having unfairly given us false hope. This meant we were now more rushed for our transfer train from Chester to Liverpool, having been on a knife-edge for the entire journey from Conwy to Chester wondering if we'd make it or not, which was very stressful for us, having had someone meeting us at our originally intended destination as well. This was not helped either as a fight suddenly occured at one of the stations the train stopped off at, with there seeming to be nobody on guard at that station to intervene, meaning the guards on our train had to get off an intervene, only adding to the delay of course. \n\nTo add to things of course, as if we hadn't been fated enough, despite having actually intervened in the fight on the platform, they still actually allowed at least one of the people who were connected with the fight onto the train, who was shouting and swearing away through the window as soon as she got on the train, something which should not have been allowed on a train. We moved into the next carriage of course, as this was especially hard for me being a highly sensitive person.\n\nOf course, we ended up missing the transfer train back from Chester to Liverpool, which was most stressful and infuriating for us. The guard on the train also told us via announcement just as the train was arriving at Chester how to get this train despite the fact we were obviously far too late for it, which they surely must've knewn, but clearly just weren't taking proper note of things. The guard also giving us lost hope by telling us that it looked like the train was making up for lost time and that we'd arrive at Chester at the original time did not help either, as of course we ended up just losing time instead, being even later than we expected.\n\nOur bad luck seemed to not end and our fury only grew as of course now we had missed the train we had originally planned on getting we had to wait another 28 minutes to get the next train that was our inevitable plan b of course, which would be a longer journey than the one we were originally meant to do. As if this wasn't bad enough, I had to pay \u00a37.80 for a new train ticket, something I was not supposed to pay for in the first place, with things only continuing to get worse when I discovered that I couldn't even get it as an e-ticket and had to trek all the way up the stairs, across the bridge and down the stairs to the front of Chester station where the ticket machines where to get my ticket, and back again. This was late at night as well which of course really added to the stress for us, having gotten back home much later than planned.\n\nIf this trainline had just not been delayed and messed us around so terribly then things would have gone much smoother for us. This line really needs to get their act together, as such an inconvenience as this has infuriated me and my mum so much that we will not be able to rest mentally until we get the compensation we most require. \n\nVery appalled at having been messed around so terribly, with such incompetency from this trainline and its connected train services.",

        "review_text": "I paid for a seat on their Chester to Bangor line. The train arrived over 20 minutes late. Train was completely overbooked and many passengers were forced to stand, including myself, as well as mother's of infants with prams and elderly passengers.  There simply was no place to sit and barely place to stand. (See my profile photo of folks queuing to board). Luggage packed the entry ways and isles.  They brought in a couple more coaches, and, after about another 20 min delay, we finally set off, albeit still standing and packed in like sardines, all while in the midst of a pandemic. If there had been an accident on the line, and a need to disembark quickly, it would've been impossible to do so. This was dangerous on both these fronts. I wrote a DM on Twitter expressing these concerns and was reassured their staff are \"properly trained\" in safety. Obviously, they are NOT. You cannot properly evacuate an extremely overcrowded train in a timely manner.  I then was told I was not eligible for a refund. These vampire corporate bloodsuckers have no shame in taking a hard working person's money and not giving a damn about their commitments to services offered . I will most certainly be filing a complaint with the Transportation Board. Caveat emptor.\n\nPS--dont need an insincere, bs apology, Anna, or anyone else working for this train \"service\". Don't need excuses either. Save your breath, please.",

Train from Shrewsbury to Gabowen was cancelled meaning a two hour wait for a replacement. On the return journey the same happened and we had to wait two hours for a replacement bus. Took ages with the last stop at Cardiff Central expecting to arrive at midnight. Three hours late. I am dreading going back to work once restrictions lift because it\u2019s clear I\u2019m going to be permanently late for meetings. If TFW had anything about them they\u2019d give all passengers a refund today but they won\u2019t. Their customer services will have a usual reply about how hard they strive etc etc. Getting past a joke a long time ago. They are so fortunate that Welsh Government simply don\u2019t care about how well they deliver.",

I bought and paid for a return train journey from Llanelli to Pembroke on the 17th Dec 2020 for me and my 11 year old daughter to visit family. Getting off the train in Carmarthen at 10:55, this is where the changeover takes place the security ask to see your tickets to which I show him. He then asks me to show him my family and friends card which I showed him, it had unknown to myself expired. After an awkward silence from him he asked me to follow him to the ticket office where I apologised to the lady explaining that I've not been on the train for a while due to Covid/delays/cancellations etc and I was more than happy to pay the extra that the train fare would cost, 1/3rd. She was not at all helpful and said that I would have to pay in full my journey from Llanelli to Pembroke even though I'd already paid \u00a315 for what is normally a \u00a323 standard fare. My 11 year old daughter was now pulling at me asking to leave, crying and both the lady at the counter and guard were very unemotional/cold. Rather than cause her any more emotional trauma I said I couldn't afford the extra cost and said to both staff we would have to catch a bus home, my daughter had \u00a310 spending money which I had to use to catch a bus back to Llanelli. The guard escorted me and my daughter out to the gate and watched us walk up the hill leading to the main road in Carmarthen. So, anyone reading this will agree, Shocking is an understatement of me and my daughters treatment by the staff in Carmarthen railway Station.",

The conductor explained that we had to get them on the app and was rather rude. Other people on the train had the same issue but was let off because that was the only way they accepted the payments for the ticket, there was nothing on the app saying they only accepted tickets online. \nAlso the signs that are placed on the seats and what the staff say are very different, eending mixed messages. On the sign it says if you are from the same household you can sit together, but we got told we were not allowed which is understanding under the current circumstances but why does the signs send a different message?\nEach conductors saying different things, the next train we got we were told we shouldn't get the train we should get a taxi as the train is only for key workers and essential travel. He saw we had shopping bags and mentioned there was no need to go all this way as there are shops in tywyn, (he too was rather aggressive) if this was the case the app needs to be updated regularly with updates on what we are supposed to do, or all conductors need to be told the same guidelines.",

Cancellations and long delays, staff/conductors are passive aggressive. As a company who clearly has NOT done their market research to KNOW what the on and off peak hours are. Paid for ticket In advance. Have complaint with Ombudsman who are doing absolutely nothing. Basically agreeing that it is acceptable to pay for a weekly ticket, when the trains are cancelled and no r'ment services, having to find alternative transportation in which you have to pay for AGAIN!! City commuters taking up the space on Valley lines, preventing others getting to their actual destination due to carriages exceeding capacity. Valley line commuters have to wait 20-30 mins for their service, city commuters have wait 10 mins!! Or have the option to walk!! Disgrace would be an understatement.",

It was held up between Abergavenny and Hereford for about 45 minutes, because of signalling problems, then proceeded at a reduced speed.\n\nThey terminated the service at Crewe, to make matters worse. The connecting train from Crewe was an hour late arriving and I eventually reached Manchester 2 hours late.\n\nThe return train,at 4.31 pm, was just a 2 (or 3) carriage train. Ridiculous at a main railway station at a peak travel time, and was dangerously over-crowded. \n\nLast year, when Arriva ran the trains, I caught the 6.50 am train from Cardiff to Manchester Airport, which had a problem with the windscreen wipers and also terminated at Crewe. \n\nFortunately I'd allowed plenty of time to get to the airport, and despite arriving nearly 2 hours late, caught my plane.",

It doesn\u2019t seam like they truly care about making people late every morning, and show no indication of changing their crappy service anytime soon.

There is so many things to say!\nEverything I am about to type is from the take over to now so less than half a year basically. \n\nSo, first instance I\u2019ve had with these is a cancelled train which caused me to be late for work!\nSecond instance the train was delayed by a whopping 35mins! So I made a complaint and the response I got was \u201cthat is not one of our trains\u201d which is ludicrous because I bought a ticket and it shown up as Transport for Wales and even the guy who served the ticket said when people kicked off for being delayed for so long, so I deleted the email because of the brainless reply. \n\nThen one day I am heading home for work, finished at a great time to get home and spend time with the kids before bedtime, did I get home in time? Hell no! I left work at 18:00, the train journey is 22mins! I got home for 21:00! Figure that out and this was because we got into Cardiff central, the driver gets off and people sat there for about 45mins before someone came and told us this train is cancelled as we have no driver and we have to move platforms, this happened more than once baring in mind!\n\nThe time telling I find amusing, this company cannot tell the time! Here is a great example apart from being late on a daily basis! \n\nNow, the train is due at 09:50, the digital board says ON TIME, the time shows 10:20, so how is it on time then? This happens a lot, I am not joking, every time in the morning this is 100% the issue. \n\nSo I pay \u00a370.70 a month for my train ticket, I have made multiple complaints and I got a refund for the grand amazing total of \u00a31.80! I seen it and laughed so much I now have a bad chest because that is hilarious. \n\nOh this is a good one. I like to listen to music on the way to and from work. I cannot when on the trains anymore due to, getting the train from my location which I know goes to the stop I want to get off, to 90% of the time stopping in Cardiff central to go to a totally different f**ing place because of whatever reason. So why the hell does this train have the places I want to go before we all have to swap and I\u2019ve seen this so many times a mass off people get off and get back onto a different train. Useless. \n\nOh, the two carriages first thing in the morning for a train rammed with so many people is amusing. Brainless is the wrong word I would say because it\u2019s amusing to see this company setup to fail. \n\nThis company is a joke and beyond anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Heck Arriva trains had some issues but this company has raised the bar and then destroyed the bar because the sky is not the limit for these guys. \n\nCancelled trains, delayed trains and stopping mid travel to wait and swap because of whatever issue they have.
