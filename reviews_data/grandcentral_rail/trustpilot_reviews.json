I did this 29 days after the 28 day limit so they used this excuse to decline a refund of just 31 Pounds. I fully accept it was a day late, but it was only delayed due to me initially applying via LNER, so you would expect some leniency here. \n\nAs a result of this experience I now strongly recommend you do not travel with Grand Central as if they can get out of refunding you, they will.\n\nIf someone from GC sees this and would like you to reach (220561 refers) out, then let me know and I will be more than happy to update this review, but as it stands I will never travel with them again.

No trolley service, dirty toilets, poor customer service. There is very little ticket inspection especially when the train is busy, I recently had someone sitting in my reserved seat and staff  just put me in an empty seat without checking if the person had a ticket or asking him to move.\nAlso paid for first class ticket but coach had a group of  loud potty mouthed drunk yobs.\nWhen I complained the member of staff just shrugged his shoulder. He didn't check their tickets or have a word with them to make less noise. Needless to say, I have already booked my next journey with LNER and future journeys with Grand Central have been put on hold.",

They always cancel some on the day, ALWAYS. \n\nThey usually cancel some in advance too so you have 1, or if you are lucky, 2 GC trains to pick from.\nI am not joking, it is that bad.\n\nThey often don't get \"an agreement with another operator\" so you can't just get other trains, you wait for their specific ones OR you can get the next GC train, if there is one there is.\n\nYou usually will have your train cancelled. It is a miracle if it goes ahead.\n\nIf they cancel the train, you often have to deal with 2 changes on trains to get to your destination, or wait for the next GC train, which could be many hours away as they only run a few a day, and most are cancelled each day for the same reasons.\n\nReasons for cancellations are ALWAYS:\n\n1. Train was broken down\n2. Too many trains needing repair at the same time.\n\nBeing disabled, I can't do 2 change trains, so I have to use GC who are the only direct train from the area.\nIf they cancel the train, I have to wait for the next GC as I simply can't do the 2 changes due to disability.\n\nAnd even then, you have no seat and the trains are full, and most people don't move for disabled people who aren't in a wheelchair sadly.\nMost are selfish, so we are left in agony, sitting in the door ways on the floor...\n\nThose are the reasons you will get every day on GC.\nEVERY DAY.\n\n",

So they could not help the engineering work being carried out but it just made the journey from Doncaster to London and back so uncomfortable. The seats are at a strange angle which is comfortable for about 20 minutes but then you feel like your sliding down the seat. Both trains were incredible hot and due to cancelled services they had combined several service together so every seat was full adding to the heat.  The carriages are cramped so if your sitting in the isle every time someone walks pass extremely expect to be banged into. Overall it was just an uncomfortable journey. Think I\u2019ll be going back to the Sheffield London route for the next visit.",

They are slightly too high so I get pain in my legs due to the pressure of not being able to put my foot flat on the floor (I can't see a single woman near me that can). They are too long in the seat so I can't comfortably lean back, the back is angled and shaped for a much taller person so curves inward where I need lumbar support. A slightly more ergonomically universal design could be considered in the next trains to increase comfort for many passengers.",

First class will get you some complimentary snacks and one drink...no real food. The train isn't smooth, which means my coffee was spilling everywhere anyway.\n\nThe first class carriage was untidy, with some tables having bottled water scattered on them and some not.\n\nThe main advantage of taking this line is to avoid changing at Leeds if you are heading to the Halifax or Calderdale area, since the change is much easier (assuming trains are on time).\n\nI'd like to point out that I travelled in the opposite direction outbound using LNER also via first class and that service was excellent with hot lunch menu and loads of drinks, snacks etc. Train was quicker smoother too. Just a much better experience all-round.",

No table meant no QR code to access food menu but nice lady on the train took my complimentary order verbally. Very poor choice compared to 1st class in othet services I have used. In addition very nice lady did zap the QR code for me from a other table... twice.... because no WiFi meant with tunnels etc kept timing out. Finally got on to order some hot food and .... only menu showing was the complimentary items no access to the hot food and cold beverages! As a single traveller with mobility issues left me unable to order anything to be delivered to my seat.  Very poor 1st class experience and will not use Grand Central trains again.",

It was the last stop, I tried to phone around 1-2 hours after I had realised the situation and we got a fair amount of what was to be expected. To wait and see, which we both did. After a few days we got a reference number and when leaving Sunderland we checked back with the train to see if our item had been put aside. They looked confused and told us it was possible that it could be in kings cross, we arrived in kings cross and they told us it was likely with grand central. It seems they knowingly misinformed us that the cleaning staff are totally separate to grand central, despite say items being found lost and remaining at destinations like Sunderland. It reflected poorly on the journey which itself was fairly uncomfortable.",

They felt quite nice back then. But now less so. The engine was noisy on the first journey. You could hear the engine drone quite noticeably and sometimes did not sound healthy sounding like it was misfiring a bit on full power. Noise aside though it was fine and arrived on time. On the way back it was even louder with resonance at certain speeds causing a loud vibration reminding me of a distant fog horn. It then became apparent that we would have to stop at every station for at least an extra 5 minutes to reset the engine. The seats are a bit too curved as people have mentioned. Not a problem for me but might be for some. An hour late, staff were pleasant and apologetic but it feels like these trains need maintaining better.

All other train lines above storage can fit my small suitcase but grand Central cannot. \n\nThe leather seats look large but when you sit down you're actually crammed in. The aisles can barely fit 1 person at a time and they over book tickets so people are standing all over the place. \n\nTerrible.",

Throughout the whole duration, our train was going no quicker than 50 mph. We constantly stopped, even though there was nowhere to stop. The train was very hot inside, and extremely full. The overhead space was too small to fit my small hand-luggage. Which was very annoying. We were stationary for most of the journey.",

Someone complained to the staff about the cold but nothing happened for a long time.\n\nThe luggage racks are not deep enough to put a small case. There was no luggage space left between seats.

I travel them regularly from Sunderland to London as they always seem to be the cheapest option and when I was a broke student travelling from London to the North East they always dug me out of a hole so I sort of have a sentimental feeling toward them but alas, I must be honest.\n\nI've never really experienced a problem with their customer service. I've always found it to be brilliant and both on board and via Social Media/Phone they have been attentive and dealt with matters quickly and efficiently.\n\nNow for the trains. This is where they really let themselves down. The trains they use are really starting to show their age. I usually go first class and whenever I travel the seating looks more and more beat up than the previous time. There shouldn't be train seats coming off in first class, the seats should be allowed to recline, this wasn't just mine, but several. I'm not really bothered too much about the catering in 1st but I do expect the hard product where you park yourself down for 3hrs+ to be fully functional and not falling apart!\n\nAs stated before, I do like Grand Central, maybe more for nostalgia than anything else but they really need to improve! Especially as the other 2 operators to the North East now (LNER and Lumo) offer a much better experience!",

Yep, FOUR tables that were used by ONE member of staff to sit and have a cup of coffee while the rest of the paying public had to stand or sit in the vestibule. Surely that's what the spare time at destinations is for, so staff can have a break. This isn't the first time, it's EVERY time. Another annoying thing is the staff don't open the doors until 10 minutes before departure giving you very little time to get aboard and find your seats. All well and good while the staff are sitting enjoying themselves while people wait to board. Absolutely disgraceful service. Apart from one or two of the female staff, the mostly male staff are surly, grumpy and unhelpful. Try LNER or Hull Trains",

There was a significant delay on the return leg of my journey, but the train crew were professional and communicated effectively with passengers, and the driver made up as much time as was safely possible, so we got back in to London with minimal delay.

I got an email the day before travel informing me that the train was cancelled. We were told to get the next available Grand Central train which was two hours later. When we boarded the train it was almost full and every seat had a reserved card on it. We ended up in the middle of the carriage unable to move anywhere as people crammed in from both doors. We ended up with no seats and all 4 of us standing/sitting on the floor for the entire 2 hour journey. The carriage aisle was bunged with people and luggage with at least 15 people standing in the carriage we were in. Most of these people were tourists and had a very poor impression of British rail travel. It is disgraceful that people are treated so despicably. If you are going to cancel trains then put far more carriages on the trains that are running. Why should people who booked seats 3 months in advance have to sit on the dirty floor? I will never travel with Grand Central Railways again.",

Firstly the seats: I'm 6'2\" so I really like that there is more legroom than on LNER in Standard seats. I agree that the neck curve in the seat back is a bit low, but if you don't try to make your neck fit, it's fine and causes me no discomfort. \n\nThe advance fares are unbeatable and this influences my rating because cost is my most important factor. The staff are great. They seem like regular people: friendly and helpful because they genuinely want to be, not because of some dictat from HR. Ok, it's pot luck if the air con or the wi-fi works in your carriage, but it does so many more times than not. The trains are getting old, they break down more than they should but if a train is cancelled they whisk me off to Wakefield on a coach and pay for me to use my ticket on LNER or whatever it's called these days. I usually get there at the same time I would on GC and sometimes earlier, but the Avanti trains seem bland and characterless in comparison.\n\nYes, on occasion, I've experienced most of what the one star reviews complain of. But most of the time, it all works as it should. And the trains are full, no matter when I travel, so GC are obviously getting something right. For me, that's giving fantastic value for money.",

This despite there being 2 trains before hand which according to Trainline had lots of available tickets but Grandcentral didn\u2019t want to pay LNER to put its passengers on those trains. So paid \u00a372 to put my wife on the next LNER train so she could get back in time for her deadline and have a stress free journey. Couldn\u2019t claim back the Grandcentral fare because it was an advance ticket what ever that means. At the end of the day if they can\u2019t fulfill their obligations the ticket should be refundable regardless of what type it is. We make these trips at least once a month. Rarely an issue with LNER and if there is at least one knows there will be another train along soon. At least LNER reply to their reviews on Trustpilot good ones and bad ones. Not one response on here from Grandcentral. Shame really. I usually like supporting the smaller companies but my advice- it may cost a little more but stick to booking a real railway company - not a pretend one. I certainly won\u2019t be using them again.",

        "review_text": "I write this review with a heavy heart as a once loyal customer of Grand Central. Their service has plummeted drastically, to a point where I can no longer condone using their services. The issues are never-ending and have transformed what was once a dependable train service into a nightmare.\n\nFirstly, the app, a critical tool for any modern traveler, is a labyrinth of problems. Amending or refunding bookings feels like a Herculean task rather than a simple click of a button. The difficulties experienced here alone are enough to deter any potential passenger.\n\nNext, the staff, both onboard and over the phone, have left me aghast. Their attitude is nothing short of despicable, a stark contrast from what one would expect from service providers. The lack of courtesy and professionalism is palpable and has single-handedly tarnished the image of Grand Central for me.\n\nMoreover, the amenities offered to first-class passengers are severely lacking. The comfort and convenience that are supposed to justify the higher ticket price are simply not there, making the first-class experience feel like a hollow promise.\n\nIn summary, Grand Central has lost its way. As a lifelong user, it pains me to see the decline and I'm left with no choice but to seek out other train services. Grand Central, you've lost a faithful customer due to your subpar services, appalling staff attitudes, and the lack of amenities for first-class passengers. I implore potential passengers to consider other options before choosing Grand Central.",

        "review_text": "I may have been on the same train from London as the other reviewer on 16th June. A warm sunny day and a hellhole of a carriage, no ventilation, no aircon, no blinds on windows to protect from the sun, dirty, grubby carriage with sticky seats, too hot for the buffet to be open and a non-stop journey of 2 hours. But I was lucky, my stop was York, the first one from London, the service was cancelled from York to Sunderland, those with onward travel from York will have got home much later than they planned on a Friday evening and after a shocking journey.\nAt the time of writing, over 70% of reviewers on TrustPilot have rated the service from this organisation as 1 star, there are clearly a lot of very unhappy people reporting issues that point directly to a lack of essential investment.\nThe ORR is the regulator, they need to be reading online reviews to help them monitor TOCs, its an easy and cheap source of info on how well TOCs are performing. \nWill it take take someone falling seriously ill, getting hurt or worse before something is done here? It's criminal negligence by Grand Central, Arriva (owners) and the regulator.",

        "review_text": "When I arrived at Halifax station yesterday to board the 10:40am to London Kings Cross I was informed by the staff that it was not running and had not for the past few weeks !! . I was appalled as I was not informed via email which is the usual procedure with other train companies. To make matters worse my ticket was not going to be accepted by another train company\u2018i.e LNER. I was advised by the staff at Halifax station  that they were told to inform affected customers to take the next scheduled Grand Central train at 15:03 , effectively a 5 hour delay . I was also informed that it is possible that it may not be  running or buy another ticket for a specified train which they could not guarantee I would get it in time . I couldn\u2019t afford another as I had already spent over \u00a370 for the Return ticket. I also rang customer service and relayed the issue and the agent\u2019s reply was to check the website which did not help as they should have emailed all the affected customers. The first part of the journey on\nFriday was by LNER which was a fantastic service. When the Grand Central train  arrived they also promised an at seat service which did not materialise on the return journey . They also arrived 8 minutes later at London Kings Cross as they stopped for over 10 minutes  at Peterborough station in order to AVOID arriving too early, which then impacted my onward journey from Kings Cross ! I\u2019m afraid I will not be using Grand Central again & my friends too .",

My assigned seat was covered in rubbish and food remnants. I spent a couple of minutes tidying/cleaning the area but felt really uncomfortable picking the nasty crap off the floor where my bag and feet would go. I ended up waiting to see how busy the carriage got and decided to move.\n\n- when I quizzed the lady member of staff about the mess, she blamed it on people from Sunderland. My mum and dad are from Sunderland! \n\n- Train WiFi wasn't working at all\n\n- The food ordering system is now done online.goodness knows why they couldn't keep with a more personal service of the staff taking the order. Just doesn't feel right.\n\n- In any case the online ordering system wasn't working for my seats.\n\n- As part of your 1st class offering, you only get option of really basic and small complimentary snack and limited selection of drinks. Everything else you have to pay for. Even a small can of coke is \u00a31.50.\n\n- the toilets were abysmal. No 1st class specific toilet and the one that was in operation was tiny and disgusting.\n\n- and to finish things off, we were 30 minutes late to destination (not necessarily Grand Central's fault, but added to the horrible experience).\n\nAll in all, I thought Hull Trains was bad, but this takes the biscuit.",

Do they even read them one wonders and do they care? Probably not. \n\nUnfortunately my review related to trains we had booked online using their website being cancelled between York and London in both directions. I accept that trains can get cancelled (annoying though it is) but in this case, why did they not email us to tell us (they have our email addresses in the booking) and looking at the daily cancellations, it is obvious that the two trains we were due to travel on are regularly cancelled. On the GC train we eventually caught, the guard told us \"we have significant train reliability problems at the moment, hopefully they will sort them out\". This needs to include the toilet which shut itself down because it thought it was full - the guard said it was not full, just having an off day. What made it more challenging for us  is that one of us is wheelchair bound - they managed to automatically cancel our passenger assistance minutes before the train was due to leave but not tell us hours before we were due to leave. It would be nice to know that Grand Central as a company actually care about customer service.\n\nI am however able to say that their staff on the trains go out of the way to be helpful and kind, a pity that their management seem to be useless.",

        "review_text": "I'm on the 11:27am to Sunderland. I booked 1st class as I can't walk to the buffet with a walking stick and then carry a drink back. This is the 2nd journey I've taken this month were the option to be served at my seat was not available, so a very dry journey. I now don't trust GC to have this option available. It seems that saving money takes priority over a good service. I have always chosen GC in the past due to their excellent service and also recommended them to friends - NO longer because they can't consistently live up to their claims of a quality service. The conductor announced this train was fully booked and standing room only. There are people standing in this carriage and the next one, so even if I was able bodied it would be difficult to walk down to the buffet but with a walking stick it's impossible. I feel this is definitely a case of ageism. GC needs to consider that not everyone has a smart phone. On my previous journey I helped to order for an elderly couple who got on at Northallerton and didn't have a phone but the drinks didn't arrive. This train was travelling to London and on asking the ticket inspector, she said they were so busy that catering had switched off the 'at table service'. This couple had travelled up using LNER first class and had expected the same level of service from GC but were really disappointed. On their LNER journey there was a trolley service for 1st class with the option of a hot meal or sandwich, endless tea,coffee,biscuits and no need for a smart phone. They will not be using GC in the future and nor will I.",

        "review_text": "Ah, Grand Central Railways, the masters of the rail comedy scene! \ud83d\ude82\ud83e\udd23\n\nSo, picture this: I've been on a quest to find that elusive review option that seems to have gone rogue, and lo and behold, I've finally cracked the case! I will use trust pilot to lock in my opinion to infinity...... and beyond.\n\nNow, my usual steed of choice is LNER, but I've always had this inexplicable fascination with the West Yorkshire - London Kings Cross service by Grand Central, even though I've never had the honour (or horror) of riding it. You see, I hail from the legendary town of Brighouse, a place so devoid of train stations in the '90s that we had to commute via carrier pigeons. So, when I started to see Brighouse, Low Moor, and Halifax listed on the departure board at one of London's grandest train stations, I thought I'd entered an alternate dimension.\n\nBut, brace yourselves for the plot twist of the century! I decided to take the plunge on my return trip this week. I call Wakefield home these days, and I could practically roll out of bed and stumble into either Westgate or Kirkgate stations. I mean, I'm about 400 meters closer to Westgate, so that's where my loyalty typically lies. Little did I know what was in store for me by giving Kirkgate and Grand Central a bash..\n\nNow, I'm a connoisseur of first-class travel, and I come equipped with a laundry list of expectations. But here's where the hilarity kicks in: Grand Central Railways redefines first class in the most absurd way possible. You know what a first-class ticket gets you with them? Drumroll, please... a first-class seat! No frills, no thrills, just a fancy chair.\n\nThe comedy begins at the station, right smack dab in the heart of the UK. Now, I get it; Grand Central may not be the Godzilla of the rail world, but couldn't they at least cozy up to the lounge provider at Kings Cross? Nope, not a chance! Trying to get some work done in the hour before my train was as futile as teaching a goldfish to juggle.\n\nAnd then, the grand boarding spectacle! The train itself was, well, let's say \"clean-ish.\" As for the tables, they looked like they'd been ignored since the days of steam locomotives. But let's not dwell on that. What really had me in stitches was the discovery that there was not a single meal in sight on this journey. None, zero, nada! And as if that weren't enough, their boiler decided it needed a vacation, leaving us without hot drinks.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Their idea of \"table service\" is a comedy routine worthy of a standing ovation. You're supposed to scan a QR code to order a drink, and they promise to bring you a snack and a beverage. Sounds promising, right? Well, not on my service! All I got was the message that the venue was closed....But never fear, my fellow traveler's, as a broad Yorkshire accent told us...... you can always embark on an epic quest through standard class to the buffet car, where you can flash your ticket like a VIP for the privilege of buying carrying your own snack back to 1st class.\n\nIn summary, Grand Central Railways, you've earned a solid 2 stars from me. And that's only because the seat was comfy enough for a quick nap. Apologies, but this isn't a 5-star journey; it's a 5-star comedy show that had me doubled over with laughter! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude02",

My wife had a broken foot so had to use a wheel chair and unfortunately we didnt make any up front bookings for assistance ( didnt know we had too ! )However we both have to say a massive thankyou for the Grand Central staff for the excellent service. they honestly couldn't do enough to assist and the lady on the return journey even came back to our coach to ensure we got off safely. When we got home I realised that with everything going on with the wheelchair, etc i had left a bag on the train. I contacted customer services they rang Sunderland station and found my bag, they were absolutely fantastic and I will certainly use this service again",

There were people crammed on the floor who were elderly and one poor lady had a broken toe having to cling to the moving part of the vestibule.  On my train there must have been at least 90 people standing in each carriage. We stood for 2 hours all the way to Doncaster - never in 30 years of making this journey has that ever happened to me. The conductor came on the tannoy and said the train is full because everyone is using open tickets when that\u2019s not true we all had advanced tickets. To blame the passengers for YOUR mistake as a company is utterly shameful. I sincerely hope there is not a tragic accident in the future with such severe disregard to public safety let alone being covid safe.",

Grand Central themselves the one thing privatisation has proven is that they are a brilliant train operating company dealing with an evil cancer moron poo called the class 180 but yet the company themselves are doing brilliantly despite the fact they are dealing with an evil train. In fact Grand Central Trains are the politely train operating company I have come across in terms of online requests and satisfaction. I agree that they are brittains best train operator because they work as a team and they actually care about all of their customers unlike ignorant LNER AND THEY ARE ALWATS ATTENTIVE they lead. Grand Central have proven they are more than capable of making the positive our of a bad situation I.e they evil class 180s that don't work and are extremely dysfunctional Trains with no working motors and the punctuality of the trains despite the fact they are more ugly than Satan himself actually work properly because for a crappy train they always run on time and that's down to Grand Central Trains caring positivity. Grand Central customer service team are extremely helpful and care more about their target market than LNER managers do. I Love Grand Centrals employees and their extremely positive forwards planinging and their trains arerun really nicely but the trains themselves are just born monsters like thereasa may and they are doing well to the fact the Grand Central are such an excellent !!!TEAM.",

I have contacted Grand Central customer service who said I have to buy another ticket in order to get a refund on my original ticket - costing double the price.  I have been told that because travel has not been banned I will not receive a refund!!  So I have a choice either to buy a ticket for February costing double the price or travel from a tier 3 to a tier 2 area, stay with my daughter in a one bedroom flat (I can't stay in a Hotel in a tier 2 area).  GRAND CENTRAL HAVE LOST 3 CUSTOMERS who travel at least 4 times each between the North East and London every year and I would advise anyone not to make an Advance Booking reservation with them.",

Unfortunately, I overlooked the terms and conditions. Therefore, I have no choice but to go for it rather than losing my money for nothing which was \u00a365.30.\n\nI explained my situation to the three customer service representatives I talked to but no one listen instead they all go with their spiel and I ended helpless and hopeless. I told them that the reason of my travel was for an appointment with US Embassy in London but the US Embassy cancelled it due to covid-19 situation in London. Although, these representatives I spoked with offered me option where I have to book another ticket which is a peak-off ticket (more expensive ticket) before they will refund my original purchased ticket. However, I mentioned to these people that I do not know yet the specific date because it really depends on US Embassy when they will be opened to the public again.\n\nHopefully, this company has flexible terms and conditions especially today with our current situation (Covid-19 Pandemic).\n\nLesson Learned:\n1. Read the terms and conditions from start to end regardless of how long it is. \n2. I will not make anymore business with Grand Central Rail after this experience. \n\nGood part:\nI am a type of person who planned in advance, in fairness with Grand Central Rail, when I looked for train tickets last July 2020 for September 2020, only their company has an advance schedule trip to London. Which is very convenient for me to plan ahead.",

        "review_text": "As a family with a daughter living in London we often use the Grand Central service from Brighouse or Mirfield  to London KX.\nIn the main it is very helpful for us to have a direct train from these little towns despite services available being minimal.\nWe have at time experienced specific trains being cancelled on this route - with alternative arrangements offered - so I always make a point of checking in advance. \nWe also make sure we have a seat reservation due to disability..... able passengers taking the priority seats  generally will not surrender the seat.\nOn Sunday morning 3 August 8am mid   pandemic,  the train wasn\u2019t at full capacity. My daughter and partner were travelling  into London from Mirfield.\n I queried via Twitter if the service would still be running. I got a very polite and prompt response from somebody with the initials LA confirming it would.\nI explained in my query that this journey was part of a much bigger trip i.e. they were then travelling to Heathrow and flying to Sweden to start the next phase of their  life. I simply thanked them for being a part of this journey\nThe train arrived and we helped them on with their luggage. They went to their reserved seats and were greeted with a free upgrade to 1st Class with free drinks and food in response to my Tweet. \nI see a lot of reviews on here are very negative but with respect to this journey the customer service we received was 100%.. We all felt this was an absolutely wonderful gesture.\nIn this worrying time my daughter has  now arrived  in Sweden.  Once again I thank Grand Central for being part of her journey.\nOn a side note I will add whenever possible we have purchased a seat reservation number directly through the GC website particularly for journeys departing from London KX .When passengers book open return tickets  from London a rail company probably won\u2019t  know which service those passengers might choose to return on leading to excess passengers.\nI would welcome an increase in GC services with the possibility of extra carriages .

It was then announced that the train would be terminating at Hartlepool where a bus would take us to Sunderland. Absolutely disgusting service and shocking value for money, approximately \u00a3130 return. In future we will use GNR service from Newcastle when travelling to London.",

Arrived at station to find train cancelled, had to go to another train station to catch LNER service lost seat reservation and travel assist freaking out my autistic son arrived at London an hour later than planned, had to drag my son almost kicking and screaming through the underground system at break neck speed to make our pre booked (very expensive) slot. By the time we got there my son was so upset he didn't even enjoy the exhibition, whole day was marred by the initial experience. We were so disappointed we returned back to Kings Cross early to find they had cancelled the return leg aswell. Again lost our allocated seating and travel assist. Managed to sweet talk the LNER staff to put us on an earlier train as the alternate transport arranged by GCR would have seen us arrive back to the wrong station at around midnight with no connection back to where our car was. The GCR staff were apathetic as was customer services and my sons longed for Christmas treat was ruined. Will we ever use them again ---- NO ------ take my advise use LNER they couldn't have been anymore helpful.\n\nP.s tried to get a partial refund for train being cancelled, received email from GCR saying because LNER service was better than theirs and more efficient we didn\u2019t qualify for refund but as a gesture of good will gave us 25% off next purchase........ cheeky ba**ards.",

Refund policy difficult with lots of loopholes. My sense is, it\u2019s all a scam. Double or triple book the train, take customer money and then let them work out how to get to their destination.

You can imagine the panic that set in.\nTOTAL NIGHTMARE and when I spoke to 'Customer Services' ,I use that term very loosely,they couldn't find my booking (but happily kept the \u00a3470 I'd paid) then told me they'd refund me (which incidentally wouldn't reach my account for at least 3-5days) but I would have to buy another set of tickets costing me over \u00a3500!\nThe whole scenario caused me at least 1 hour of phone calls during work time and untold stress at what was already a painfully difficult time for me having just buried my father on the Monday.  A shocking company and a shocking backward way to conduct business in the 21st century. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!",

GC\u2019s policy is to reserve seats for anytime/off peak tickets if they are requested, until 24 hours before departure. \n\nNow I will explain why this information is crucial. As a fairly regular user of GC trains, I can safely affirm that every single train I have ever boarded after 4pm is overcrowded. There are simply not enough carriages to serve the customer demand of these trains and nothing appears to have been changed to alleviate this. Unreserved seating areas are few and far between, and on occasion you\u2019ll be lucky to get a fold-down seat in the vestibule. \n\nEach time I\u2019ve travelled on GC I have overhead people who have similar complaints. I suppose from a business perspective it\u2019s great - save yourself a few bob by loading customers like cattle into your trains instead of increasing the carriages. But if one thing\u2019s for sure, I now avoid GC like the plague. Give me LNER any day. I\u2019ll pay extra. I\u2019d probably even walk from Northallerton to York to avoid it.",

Every single toilet on the train was dirty and blocked, meaning I could not use the toilet for the entire 3 hour journey. The train was so dirty I tried to use the sink to wash my hands but no soap. The temperature on the train was dangerously hot. I\u2019m assuming the air con was broken, as a surly member of staff distributed small bottles of free water to everyone, though he did not at any point apologise or provide an explanation for the excessive temperature. As soon as I left the train I found a guard and told him that the service was appalling. He agreed but told me there was nothing staff could do and to tweet a complaint.

I arrived in London 45 minutes late. My complaint is more about the way customer service handles the situation rather than the journey. I was informed no reduction on my ticket or compensation was available because they had made alternative arrangements.

I'm just giving details to explain the next point.\n\nRang the customer service line to see whether it would be possible to board the next train. The customer assistant on the phone was really unhelpful, didn't offer any help in the slightest. \n\nEnquired about whether it was possible to reserve a seat in which he said there wasn't really any reservations (just priority). Then asked if we could sit any where, in which he said that some seats are reserved (contradicting himself). So asked what should we do bearing in mind I reserved due to my wife and baby travelling, didn't offer no help and just simply gave us the option of go and see where you can sit or book another ticket (bearing in mind they cancelled on us).\n\nTo conclude, the reviews already speak for how terrible this companies customer service is and what seems best is to not waste my money on this company.",

        "review_text": "Like so many here an appalling 1st Class service from Grand Central. Booked through Trainline two first class tickets from York to Kings Cross. Got on no seats reserved and none available.\n\nThe dirty rotten trick they play is that when you think you're booking a specific train, they sneakily actually sell you an Open Return. If like us, you haven't used them before (and I never will again) you have no idea this will happen to you when you climb on board the train expecting a seat and find you don't have one. Now, this expectation in my case was exacerbated, because also at the same time through trainline, I booked 1st class Edinburgh to York returns. It cost me almost double to do this because I wanted to travel with my mate from York, in seats next to each other on that part of the return journey.\n\nOn the Edinburgh to York legs (which I travelled on my own) I got first class seat reservations automatically. Like a mug I assumed the same with Grand Central.\n\nOn the way down, we at least got seats in standard class. On the way back we stood in the packed gaps between carriages. On arrival at Kings Cross, we decided to go to customer services. There were other Service reps from the other lines there but, guess what no Grand Central Reps. They called the Grand Rep guy and he turned up shortly. We asked if we could reserve seats for the return tomorrow and he said it wasn't possible. I said I've never in my life booked a first class ticket on a train and not got a reserved seat. I said this stuff goes on all the time with you lot doesn't it. He said yes. I said you lot are a \"shower\". He said \"Yes\". To be honest ( and he was so refreshingly) we absolutely cracked up with laughter. \n\nRipped off but what a hoot, still chuckling now at him. Haven't bothered wasting my life trying to get refund of this mob.",

Upon arriving at the \"correct\" platform we were told that our problem was definitely not grand centrals problem and we were on our own.. when I requested the name and job title of the staff member in question she covered her name badge with a scarf told me to \"f@#k off\" and ran for the staff only area.. after going to the information desk and getting very little help it became apparent that the rude lady from the platform called the transport police and had made a false report that I had assaulted her..

I received an email offer for a discounted ticket. In fact I received 2 emails, each with a different offer number, within minutes of each other. Neither of them took me to anywhere I could get my discount. I complained and was told that as their system/site was working properly all they could do was send me another discount voucher. I pointed out that my travel date had now passed and a voucher would be of no use as I had no plans in the foreseeable future to travel to London. Their attitude, frankly, was a sort of polite could not care less. In June I wrote a letter of complaint to Grand Central's MD Mr McClean. Did I get a reply, or any kind of acknowledgement? Of course not. The MD of a business sets standards by example and it is obvious that his standards are on the same level as those of his staff. It is actually convenient for me to use Grand Central but they have sold there last ticket to me.",

They were too cheap to allow us to travel on the LNER/VTEC services leaving for my destination every 30 or so minutes, so I had to wait an extra hour and go the long way round.

        "review_text": "Travelled on a standard class return ticket from Sunderland to Kings Cross, first train to Kings Cross was freezing cold, but return journey back to Sunderland was the train from hell! Air con was not working for the entire journey (during a heatwave!!), train was full to capacity and everyone was complaining. Train staff gave us a very small, warm bottle of water for an over 3 hour journey! There were elderly people and children on board who were clearly effected by the heat, one parent had to strip her baby down to her nappy to try and cool her down! Staff were at a loss to deal with the numerous complaints from everyone and it appeared this wasn't an isolated incident as one regular user of Grand Central I spoke to who travels for work said this had happened several times when he has used Grand Central. I will never use their trains again. Please think carefully before booking with them!",

Most definitely their fault.\n\nEven a ticket inspector on the LNER service we jumped on said even they are now sick of Grand Central.\n\nThe onboard staff are fine, and deserve credit, but please take great care if you are relying on Grand Central to get you anywhere for a certain time. Dont say you havent been warned.\n\nThe service is shoddy beyond belief. I now go to the station expecting to look at the board and see it cancelled.

It lurched a lot around a lot on corners and even on straight stretches, and I wondered if it was a refitted 1950s commuter train not suitable for higher speeds.   \n\nThere was a smell of faeces as you entered the train which went away after a while but came back after about an hour.  Quite unpleasant... The carriage was noisy as well as the engines (still diesel in 2017??).  It sounded a bit like an old 1970s bus. \n\nThe ticket was not cheap, almost double the return leg which turns out was with Virgin.  If I see a ticket for Grand Central in the future I'll probably avoid it.",

Secondly, the trains are clean and well-taken care of. The seats are comfortable too. Free wifi on the train is an additional bonus!\n\nI also like the online booking system through their website. Very easy to navigate, and all I have to do is to bring the email confirmation, instead of having to collect tickets from the machine at the train stations.\n\nTheir prices are reasonable too, if booked well in advance. I have always had positive experience while travelling with them and can highly recommend  the company to others travelling the routes which they cover.",

I'm positive that by accident they didn't give the return ticket back. No big problem we had the reservation email seat number and could prove we bought it.  We even offered to go with a conductor the seat we had bought with the email confirming this was my seat with proof of my identity but we got told no. we got told it was are fault for loosing the ticket.  When I contacted them after through web support we got told we lost the ticket so it was are fault they just wouldn't listen to make matters worse one of the replies was not for me it was for another customer with there details and complaints reference on dealing with there issue.   I will never use them again I don't mind the lady loosing the ticket mistakes happen but when something goes wrong its how they deal with it that matters.  Shocking service shocking attitude and its obvious we didn't matter",
