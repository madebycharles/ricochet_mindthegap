Then, at Paddington we had to haul luggage up a large stair. The London train tube system is great but again, luggage was a real problem. Some stations have escalators but some don't, sometimes requiring climbing the equivalent of 3 flights of stairs. Usually a taxi/UBER  takes an hour to get us from North London to Heathrow and the cost is 60 pounds plus tip. The Heathrow express and tube train took almost 2 hours and cost us a little less than $40 each for a total price of $80 or 65 pounds. Bottom line, unless you have a small amount of luggage don't even consider  the Heathrow Express and it is cheaper and faster to take a taxi/cab anyway.",

After years of terrible service, awful staff interactions and paying for services I have not been able to use-I am finally going to boycott the service. I have had enough. I would rather pay for a driver than put up with it anymore. The rail companies need breaking up like the mining unions were.\nUPDATE 30/6/23: I have successfully got a few of my old City friends and their firms to stop using the Heathrow Express.

If you try and buy a ticket through the machine at Paddington, you may stand there for a while as it doesn't ask you for a pin unless you bend down and check the little screen next to where you've inserted the card.  Roll on cross rail which hopefully will put this bunch of cowboys out of business. In the meantime, Heathrow has a rail service that is in a par with its status as Europe's worst Airport.

I buy tickets via the app and once lost my phone enroute to work, boarding the train without realising and then tried to purchase my ticket onboard with my laptop. Their WiFi wasn\u2019t working and despite showing 100s of past tickets on email they still charged me the full peak fare and customer service weren\u2019t interested. Apart from being wildly overpriced, in over a year of commuting on the HEX not once have I seen staff go the extra mile for a single passenger. Train staff are regularly shouting over the PA onboard and at the station, frankly it\u2019s embarrassing. The barriers at Heathrow are ridiculous, causing people to get stuck in the entryways and often don\u2019t even accept valid tickets. The trains are often dirty, too hot, too cold. The WiFi rarely works and the app constantly crashes, drops out, takes ages to load your ticket or doesn\u2019t load it at all. I can\u2019t wait for the day Crossrail opens (albeit delayed).",

For some inexplicable reason, you must buy a ticket for the'correct direction' - i.e. Heathrow to Paddington or Paddington to Heathrow.  \n\nNow this where the terrible design of the app comes into play.  When you buy a ticket - the direction is already set and you have to change it if that preset direction is not the one you require.\n\nWHY OH WHY!  If you are going to require passengers to buy a ticket for a specific direction then the direction should be empty until specifically selected by the passenger.\n\nOnce you have bought your ticket there is no quick solution ... you have to contact customer services and then receive an email saying you will be contacted in 20 working days.  \n\nThere would appear to be several options for a drastic improvement:\n\n1.  remove the 'correct' direction requirement; or \n2.  remove the preset direction and force customers to chose the direction; or\n3.  include some function whereby customers can change the direction prior to travel.",

Came back to the salesperson for a refund and was told I had to file a request online. Reading their T&C the day later showed the salesperson should have refunded me on the spot. This shows their own staff don't even know their rules. \n\nAnyway, my online refund request took over 1 month to get a response from them asking for my bank detail. I sent this immediately but since then have been waiting another 2 months now and still no refund yet. \n\nI filed a complaint on their website and got an email back saying I would get a \u00a325 refund, even though the 2 tickets cost \u00a350. I asked for an explanation twice and the support person just resent their previous email, showing how little they care. Fine, I'll escalate this soon elsewhere.\n\nOf course, there may be refund processing fees involved here but without giving an explanation, Heathrow Express is simply stealing from me. \nNever buy from this company! Take the TFL rail from and to the airport for a fraction of the cost and save yourself from begging for Heathrow Express' attention.",

Normally they aim to process the refund within 20 working days of receiving your request however due to the current backlog it may take a little longer.\n\nI appreciate that this is frustrating for you, however as previously advised your case has been escalated to our payments and please be assured we will be back in touch as soon as we have further information for you.\n\nKind regards.\n\nDan Payne\nCustomer Relations Team\nHeathrow Express\"\n\nAs you can imagine I've not heard back from anyone nor received my refund and it is now 25th July. I have sent another email where I've started that this is theft and that they are scammers. Quick to take your money, but they don't want to refund you when they cannot provide a service.

I ran towards the train, the staff just stood and watched as I was 2 seconds late for the closing door. They just stood and stared and then told me I should be here earlier. Absolutely awful, way over priced and NO service whatsoever. If I pay \u00a325 for one way, I expect them to hold the door for me if I am on the platform.

Now I have been reading this comments most of these people are ridiculous. If You do not want to take Heathrow express you have many other options of transportation. 1.cheapest the tube piccadilly line ( usually crowded, dirty and no air con ) 2.Elizabeth Line take 35 mins from Heathrow to London Paddington \u00a311:60 - \u00a312. 3. local buses which you can get from heathrow central buses station between t2 & t3 above the underground station. Nobody forces any of these ridiculous humans being to get on the Heathrow express. Most people have a smart phone do your bloody research and get what best for you ! \n\nI think majority Heathrow express front line staff are very friendly and helpful. I have seen the crap that they have to put up with from the public and most these unsophisticated  travelers. I have seen these unsophisticated travelers buy their tickets from the ticket machine and then walk off and leave their tickets. Turn around and try to pass blame on the Heathrow express staff. Walking through the sign posted airport and then get frustrated that they can\u2019t find their way because they refuse to pay attention and using their unsophisticated reading skills. \n\nHeathrow express has great staff members and that company provides employment for many people. Including a 15 minutes train services that is unbeatable.",

        "review_text": "Due to a Driver having not turned up for an Elizabeth Line Train to Heathrow Terminal 5, I was forced to take a Elizabeth Line Train to Terminal 4 or I would have had to wait 15 minutes at Paddington.\n Once I boarded the Train and set off, I checked on the connection time at Terminal 2 and 3 and as luck would have it, I had a matter of less than 5 minutes to wait. Once I boarded the Heathrow Express to get from Terminals 2 and 3 for the 5 minute journey to Terminal 5, I was met with the most grumpiest, rudest Member of the Heathrow Express Team that you could ever imagine. She would rather have People (including me), stand in the Carriage further down the Train, than have them seated comfortably seated for the 5 minute journey. The Business Class Carriage was totally EMPTY and we were jammed like the Sardines in the next Carriage down. I have written to Customer Services and they are trying to fobb me off with all kinds of GDPR, nonsense emails and am so fed up with Heathrow Express Customer Services that I have decided to air my views on here. My advice for what it is worth for, is use the Elizabeth line as often it misses out on numerous Stations and does Paddington to Heathrow Terminal 5 in 26 minutes and costs far less than Heathrow Express which runs with old Rolling Stock, painted up to look good and they charge a fortune. Now that Customer Services have fobbed me off, I hope that the Management Team will read this because a 66 year old Man should not be forced to stand due to lack of seating available, irrespective 5 minute journey or not. This Member of Staff needs to be given a written warning for gross misconduct and not allowing a person in his senior years to sit comfortably. I shall also escalate this to the Railway Ombudsman for their take on this . \nHEATHROW EXPRESS HOLD YOUR HEADS IN SHAME",

        "review_text": "Landed at LHR and needed to get to Paddington as quickly as possible. On my way to the Heathrow Express I looked for the tickets vending machines but they were all out of order. From the ones straight after passport control to the ones in the main arrival area. Being in a rush to get to office and seeing the next train was leaving in 2 mins I asked one the staff at the barriers (newly set up) if she could let me get through. She pointed at the only single ticket machine in front of which another people 5 people were queuing. I asked again to be pleased let through and that I would have bought the ticket onboard (At the higher rate) bu she said it was not possible. Very annoyed about her extremely arrogant behaviour I said: I am going to be upset if I miss the train! Slamming the barriers open and shouting, one of the other staff came rushing towards me and said i had to leave the station otherwise he would have called the police. Apparently in expressing my feeling about missing the train I threatened the his colleague.. maybe he was trying to scare me off given that I am very young but I just ignored him. \nThis is the first time I actually write a review but it\u2019s just because I had 15mins to spare having missed the trained I wanted and needed to take. I think th EX service is going down the tubes, also considering that it really takes 20mins from LHR to\u2019 Paddington once a month, normally it\u2019s always slowed down by some technical problems which never seem to be in their control? I would not reccoment this service to anyone but unfortunately, until the Elizabeth line opens it\u2019s the most convenient one and the owners know it - that\u2019s why they can afford to treat people so badly.",

        "review_text": "I made a terrible mistake buying a carnet of 12 tickets for Heathrow Express via their app.  Absolutely horrible app to use.  This is what you'll get:\n1. The app logs you out after I don't know how long, so best to be prepared to log in or download your tickets to your wallet before you need to use your tickets.\n2. When you purchase 12 tickets and look at 'Tickets' in the app, you'll see 12 beautiful purple images.  Unfortunately, none of them show you the ticket's reference number.  Noooo... you'll have to click on each ticket to read the QR code or download the ticket to your wallet.\n3. Then when you are finished reading that first ticket, you'll need to go back to 12 beautiful tickets, where the page makes you scroll right from ticket one and count to the ticket you want.\n4. By the time you get to ticket 3 to download it, you'll be starting to get square eyes. \n5. Thereafter, keeping scrolling (from ticket one), counting, downloading for every single ticket till you reach 12 (if you've not got to Heathrow by that time). \n And if you forget what the last number was, oops... you might then backtrack, go back to the last ticket you think you picked and downloaded, and hope that you're right. Otherwise, start the process all over again.\n6.  And if you use a ticket from your wallet... you'd better remember which reference it was.  Because all good and used tickets will continue to stay in your wallet. There is no marking to tell you which of your wallet tickets have been used.\n7.  But there is hope - you can go back to your row of 12 tickets, click on every individual ticket, to find out if the ticket was used (it will be greyed out).  You just won't be able to find out when you'd used it.  So if you think you've used one ticket to swipe in and another to swipe out (because the same ticket somehow doesn't work work when you are trying to swipe out)... the only way you may find out is if you can log in from a laptop/PC (not your phone) - coz there's no information captured in your app or wallet tickets.\n7. And if you're like me, unable to download all 12 at one sitting, and no time to make a note of which reference numbers you've used... you'll have a fun time trying to figure out which one you've used, which one you've not downloaded... \n8. Good luck trying to ask the staff at the barriers.  If the ticket you think you used to swipe in doesn't work, they don't want to know.  You'll need to use another ticket to swipe out to get out of the barriers...\n\nIn short, if you want to waste your time scrolling, checking, downloading, using one ticket to tap in and another one to tap out by mistake, getting confused, frustrated, annoyed, then use this app.\n\nTo add to the stupidity of it all, there isn't a single portal/app for users to access all the relevant data about their tickets.\n1. App's purple tickets tell you don't tell you reference number or if it's used,  you'll need to click in to the next page where you get your QR codes.\n2. Wallet tickets tell you QR reference number, but not if it's used (only if it's past the ticket expiry date)\n3. Website tells you date that the ticket was used or 'assumed used' but not QR reference number.\n\nAbsolutely bonkers.",
