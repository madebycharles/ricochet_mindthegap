In short I bought a return ticket for 16.20 and realised this was a mistake and I only needed the outbound portion. I called up greater Anglia and the call handler was not only rude but said it was my fault for booking the wrong ticket and that I have to pay a \u00a35 admin fee for them to grant me a refund. In the end he mentioned I will only receive a refund of \u00a31.20! Nasty scammers! Why doesn\u2019t greater Anglia use all that money it\u2019s scamming of people to make a simple only refund service that people can fill out themselves without being charged a scammers fee of \u00a35. It is so hard to navigate and find this on their website. ",

In fact, the person at the airport who checked my train ticket to get onto the platform said nothing and let me proceed to platform 2 without a warning. I've soon realised that there is no train. I checked signage and very little confusing information was given. I've asked and I was informed about the coach at platform 10-11, another person was informed about 9-10. We both asked the coaches coming into platform 10 and they knew nothing. We went to the National Express office ticket (next to platform 21) to be told to return to platform 10. At platform 10 we were told to go to platform 21....\n\nLittle information, confusing information etc and in general overwhelmed staff from a company that doesn't give a damn about their customers who bought tickets in advance. \n\nGetting a coach instead of a train leads to double the travelling time. Would I get reimbursed for the considerable delay? I think I should be because you sure as hell saved a lot of money by understaffing the train station on a bank holiday when a lot of people are travelling.",

The guy was just like \"strike day, no trains until 0900\", he clearly didn't care about the inconvenience caused. Greater Anglia offered no alternative or replacement, so I panicked and payed for a taxi. So I've now had to pay for a train ticket and a taxi to London.

Third time it\u2019s back to the mail box with a cheery message saying it\u2019s full - goodbye.\nLuckily I live in Norwich so will be going in to the station to use an old fashioned method of talking to someone\nNo wonder you have 80% of 1 star comments",

Delay repay submitted and i am offered \u00a33.70 x2 because they say it was 30+ mins late..it was cancelled..as per my GA app shows me...still does.  and of course i couldn't use the return leg of the journey because i had to drive.

(yes there are stations on the route that are within the zones but on the rest of the network with hybrid routes these are handled with no barriers and instead a contactless reader and barriers at the exit stations on route. Then passengers are clear they need to get a ticket or check.\n\n- Why are there 3-4 dozen ticket checkers at the exit station at Stansted? And not 4 or 5 assistants at the barriers in Liverpool Street. Less staff who simply inform customers they need a ticket would sort everyone out.\n\n- Why are there no on-train announcements? So a passenger can leave at a contactless valid station and by a ticket there to reboard.\n\nIt is clearly a confusing setup left in but based on the setup of the Stansted Express it is very likely that the \"contactless doesn't work a ticket is required\" process is solely there to make the train operator additional income via fines.",

We waited where they said the replacement bus stops, but after 1 hour there was only a crowd of people there, all with tickets. No bus came!!  After lots of confusion and anger, a lady from a bus company helped us. She called a couple of contacts and announced that we have to wait another hour!!!! They are indeed irresponsible. They did it without any info and update.",

The only issue I have with greater Anglia is their powerless in dealing with horrid passengers having witnessed three vile teenage girls abuse both passengers and the conductor horribly.

It\u2019s a disgusting lack of customer service or customer care.  Is it sheer incompetence or is it simply a practice of lying to customers?  Either way it\u2019s totally unprofessional.",

Knowing this company can't run trains, I left lots of time in London before the Eurostar train to France. Of course Greater Anglia cancelled the train while we're waiting on the platform, all the while the screen said \"on time\". Then at 9:40 am, when it was meant to arrive it changed to 10:40am and \"on time\", simply never arriving, no text, no email, no announcement on the screen, nothing. Had to drive instead and later complain, which I did and they said there were no reported cancellations!!!! So was I and other passengers imagining the train never showing up? Carried on complaining until the woman on the phone checked, eventually agreeing that the train had been cancelled. She then agreed to refund the fare, it'll take 2 to 3 days etc etc. A week later, still no refund, I call up to find it had NEVER been actioned, she'd lied to me. The guy now on the phone a week later then puts me on hold, and then cuts me off. I call back complaining again, they cut me off again. Such a pleasant company huh? AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL company.",

        "review_text": "\nI have been travelling with my little sister which is 17. In rush I bought her child\u2019s ticket ( now I know that people are considered children under 16) because in my country people are children until they turn 18. When we arrived at London Stanstead, we showed the inspector our ticket and then we realised our mistake. The lady seperated me from my sister and wouldn\u2019t let me speak to her. She started interrogating her without any empathy. She was incredibly rude and when my sister told her that it was an honest mistake and misunderstanding she wouldn\u2019t change her aggressive attitude. She told her that she wouldn\u2019t let her through if she didn\u2019t pay the fine on the spot which she obviously didn\u2019t have enough money for (we are both students from a foreign country). My sister was almost crying and was asking her if there is any other way to pay (like a bank transfer), but she wouldn\u2019t listen and wouldn\u2019t change her aggressive posture. I realise I made a mistake and bought the wrong ticket, but is that a reason to fine me \u00a350, make me pay for a new ticket plus disrespect and humiliate my sister. The fines are unreasonably high. Greater Anglia says that you can appeal the fine if it\u2019s a genuine mistake but from what I have heard nobody has been refunded. Is this normal because in my country this wouldn\u2019t be tolerated \nP.S it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t have any ticket we just had the wrong one and we were willing to pay for the right so I think the fine is unnecessary \n",

Panicking because I needed to get off in minutes I couldn\u2019t remember my log in. The guard said I would have to pay a \u00a3100 fine, I said but I have a valid rail card and refused. He then said he would tag my ticket? I was scared about what that meant but Google says it then requires further scrutiny when exiting barriers. There are no barriers at my destination station as it\u2019s a little rural station? He was an unpleasant jobsworth over a \u00a37.65 ticket that I\u2019d saved \u00a34 with a railcard.

        "review_text": "I bought a roundtrip ticket from Stansted Airport to London (Tottenham Hale) at the airport machine and, on the printed ticket, it was written \"Return Any Date\". However, when I exited the train station in London validating the ticket, the machine did not return it (I have no clue why).\nOn the same day this happened, I contacted the customer service at \"refunds at stanstedexpress.com\" and \"contactcentre at greateranglia.co.uk\" but I did not receive any reply. \nEventually, I had to purchase a new ticket to return to the airport, costing me 21.40 pound. Overall, this inconvenient costed me the additional 21.40 pound I had to pay for the new ticket plus the extra cost I paid for the \"return\" I couldn't use (12.40 pound) for a total of 33.80 pound.\n\nIf you read my review, it means I have never received a refund.",

There were police cars and an ambulance outside the station, the timetable said the train was delayed due to a trespasser on the track between Southend Victoria and Prittlewell. \n\nI pressed the information point button and spoke to a Greater Anglia employee who informed me a train should be arriving at 23:25-30. I waited but no train arrived, between 23:30 and 00:00 I was told that a replacement bus would be put on. I was anxious by this stage as my phone battery had died and my children were waiting for me at home (earlier I had told them I would be home by 23:30). \n\nBy 00:30 there was no bus and no trains in sight, it was also raining. The GA employee told me via the information point that I would need to make my own way home and that they would reimburse me the cost. This was annoying as, if I had been informed of this at 23:30 I could have organised a taxi then but was told about this bus service that never materialized. \n\nI had to ask the policeman if he could phone me a taxi which he did thankfully. A taxi quickly arrived and I got in, he informed me it would be \u00a340 and I would need to pay upfront. I attached the receipt and a screenshot of my bank statement in an email to GA. The short version is because I could not find my single ticket home GA would not pay me a cent, not even a refund of the ticket! It's a good job I'm not teenage girl isn't it! Absolutely awful company who simply could not give a **** about their customers. AWFUL. \n",

Many of the local trains have the 5 abreast seat configuration. These seats are hard, narrow, (even for someone slim), and the narrow aisle means that if you sit in an aisle seat you will be constantly bashed by other passengers moving around. Lastly, but by no means least, is the price. Our trip from Norwich to Westcliff cost \u00a3116 and took over 3 hours. I also had to drive to Norwich station because the weekend engineering meant that the  bus substitution would have taken too long. Fuel in the car would have cost \u00a335. If my son and daughter in law had been able to attend the event, that fares would have been hopelessly disproportionate for a day out. You have to do better than this if you want more business and to encourage more people onto trains as part of an environmentally friendly effort.",

I approached the platform female guard who said  she was not responsible it was the driver as he has control.  her manager said she was the best guard he had.  God help us as to what is the worst.  `on questioning she admitted that she had witnessed that I was trying to board the train.  The manager said I had missed it!!

Six bikes is not adequate space, especially if mothers with prams block the dedicated bike space. I have personally seen train crew get on the phone in front of me because of that, phone the next station, and claim there is no more bike space on the train, despite only 3/6 being present with the rest of the space blocked by prams and suitcases which could be easily put elsewhere. This needs to stop, if this is a space for bikes then suitcases and prams must not be allowed to block that space. They can go anywhere else in the other 4 carriages. \n\nFinally, Greater Anglia has the worst refund policy in the UK. I needed to return a \u00a310 ticket and this was refused on the grounds that when a cancellation fee is deducted 'there is nothing left to return'. These 'cancellation fees' are nothing but blatant theft, and this is truly awful and really tarnishes the image of a company which is otherwise perfectly fine.",

I always use my contactless bank card to open the gate and pay for my journey. It turns out that you cannot do that to Stansted and you must buy a separate ticket. Why the double standards ? Why I can do it to Luton or Gatwick but not Stansted.\nAdditionally I boarded at Liverpool Street. Staff member saw me using my contactless card and carrying a huge luggage. Why did they not advise me that I need a ticket?? Why there was no signage or staff inside the train ? Easy answer, the company policy is to make you travel this way, so they can charge you once triple the ticket price when you arrive to Stansted and have to rush to board your plane. This disgusts me and it is acceptable in a developed country like Britain. I have no idea how this was allowed. I'm truly shocked and disgusted and I cannot recognise this country anymore",

I admitted my own fault and I was cooperating with the officer. He accepted my apology and took my details and he said  the head office will make the final decision about my case. Realising my mistake I renewed my railcard shortly after the incident. He took my old railcard after this incident 15/11/2023 I received a latter of a \u00a3142.65 penalty charge which I cannot understand at all. Someone I next to me received a \u00a370 payment charge right at the station cause of missing railcard. I did cooperate and I remember the officer did not let me pay the \u00a370 telling me they will investigate my case. I admitted my fault but I clearly do not understand why my charges started from \u00a3142.65. My letter says  settlement towards the company cost is  \u00a3100. Could you explain please why the company did not let me pay \u00a370 at that moment instead of make me wait for months and charging me double please ?\nI did not receive any letter of previous penalty charges, furthermore I am unable to appeal because I do not have a reference number starting with GA or GU\n\nI made a payment on 23/11/2023 to avoid further misunderstanding with greateranglia, however I would like to make an official complain of this kind of treatment and the fact that I had no option at all to protect myself or appeal is outrageous",

That is if it is running at all, which it probably won't be due to the sheer greed of striking drivers.\n\nWhen it does run, it will be delayed for a reason that the driver will never bother sharing. And the new timetable is a joke. They scrapped the 1642 direct service from Liverpool Street meaning I now have to change at Broxbourne with just a couple of minutes to spare.\n\nThe latest farce occurred on 30/08 when the driver decided with 10 minutes to go that we would terminate at Ware. No reason or apology given. I am assuming that it was to make the return service to London on time. So they are happy to inconvenience hundreds of commuters for the sake of a few minutes. Had time to check everyone's ticket though!\n\nAnother joke occurred last week at Tottenham Hale. I decided to use the Undergound so changed there, only to be greeted by a whole train being herded onto the overbridge for a manual ticket check. IN RUSH HOUR. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE BARRIERS THEN? Not only did it make everyone late for week, it was overcrowded and dangerous.\n\nI hope Greater Anglia lose the franchise. And that whoever decided to terminate at Ware is fired.",

I think they need to provide a better, quicker response to requests and have a more efficient telephone service.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the cheaper fare alert service didn\u2019t work either.\nI\u2019m now stuck with having to pay full price to travel by train, when I could fly abroad for the same price..it doesn\u2019t make sense..",

If you miss your train due to a problem or your schedule has changed, you have to buy a brand new full ticket that will cost you a extortionate amount because your buying it on that day! The trains work against you! Changing the time or day even if you do it ahead of time on the journey will charge you unfair admin charge! Sadly there's no other train company to go with that will give you an easier service and so you have to deal with this.\nIf it wasn't for the ridiculous railcards I would be spending thousands a year just to travel to work. I know full well that everyone agrees on the idea of lowering the cost of train tickets instead of applying a Railcard on the allready-wounded system.\nSomething needs to change. I know you have your strikes but your also effecting other people's lives. Not everyone can just quit work or stay at home on the days you deem fitting for you. This is ridiculous.

It was my wife, my granddaughter and her Mum that were travelling.\nI contacted Greater Anglia who were originally very helpful and promised a refund.\nI printed off a set of tickets for the journey.  When they got on the train,  the conductor scanned the tickets and told them that the tickets were not valid. They rang me from the train and I immediately emailed over the other sets of tickets I had received.\nAll seemed fine on the day but now Greater Anglia have refunded only one set of tickets and, seeking to rely on the fact that they say that two sets of tickets had been scanned, have refused to provide a refund so I am \u00a391.25 out of pocket.\nI can scarcely believe this, given that it was their website that was at fault in the first place and this has never been disputed. Presumably, as they hold a complete monopoly on rail travel in my area, they can treat their customers with disdain and with a total disregard to the circumstances of the particular case. Despite having explained everything in great detail, a refund is still not forthcoming.",

Contactless payment cards are only valid for travel within a permitted area. It is your responsibility to confirm that your card is valid for your entire journey prior to boarding the train. There are network maps displayed at all stations within the London area, confirming the stations that fall inside zones 1-9 where contactless payment and Oyster cards are valid for use. Please visit the Transport for London (TfL) website at [website link] for further information. \u2018\u2019\n\nMy recommendations to this organisation if their intent is to offer a good customer service (which is highly doubtful based on my experience with a fine issued, as well as the ones from so many people as seen on this website):\n1. Accept contactless payment, otherwise disable the gates to the platform to stop accepting these cards\n2. If unable to do the above, inform customers before boarding the trains (written signs & on loudspeakers)\n3. Change \u201cLondon Stansted airport\u201d name to \u201cStansted airport\u201d- how ridiculous you expect customers to think that they are not in London i.e. cannot use contactless payments!",

        "title": "A Nightmare Experience with Greater Anglia Train Service",
        "review_text": "Title: A Nightmare Experience with Greater Anglia Train Service \n\nRating: \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nMy recent experience with Greater Anglia train service was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I attempted to purchase a ticket online using their website, to my frustrating encounter with their staff at Stansted Airport, it was a series of disappointments and incompetence that left a lasting negative impression.\n\n**Lack of Proper Signage:**\nOne of the first issues I encountered was the complete lack of proper signage at the train station. When you're in a hurry to catch a train, the last thing you need is confusion about which platform to go to. Greater Anglia's failure to provide clear signage is a major inconvenience for passengers.\n\n**Inadequate Staff Assistance:**\nAs if the lack of signage wasn't enough, there was also a noticeable absence of staff members available to assist passengers. When running late, the ability to quickly purchase a ticket and board the right train is crucial. Unfortunately, Greater Anglia failed miserably in this regard.\n\n**Online Ticket Purchasing Nightmare:**\nAttempting to purchase a ticket using a smart device on their website was an exercise in frustration. I made repeated attempts without any luck, even taking screenshots to document my efforts. This should not be an issue in this day and age, and it reflects poorly on the company's technological capabilities.\n\n**Unjust Fines and Appeals:**\nUpon reaching Stansted Airport, I encountered a ticket agent who was less than helpful. Despite my best efforts and evidence of my struggles to buy a ticket online, I was fined. The ticket agent mentioned staffing issues and a lack of information for customers as reasons for the ongoing problems. While I did appeal the fine, it was a complete waste of time.\n\n**Money-Focused and Unapologetic:**\nMy overall impression of Greater Anglia is that they are just another money-focused entity, showing little regard for customer experience. It's disheartening to see such blatant disregard for customer satisfaction, especially when comparing it to transportation services in other countries like Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Poland, which are known for their superb service and efficiency.\n\n**Appeal System as a Legal Requirement:**\nFurthermore, it's worth mentioning that the appeal system, while available, seems to exist more as a legal requirement to avoid breaking UK regulations than as a genuine avenue for resolving passenger grievances. My personal experience with the appeals process left me feeling that Greater Anglia's intentions were more about saving face than rectifying their shortcomings. It's disheartening to see an appeal system in place that ultimately wastes the time of passengers who have valid concerns and evidence to support their claims. This further highlights the company's lack of genuine commitment to improving their service and prioritizing customer satisfaction.\n\n**Neglecting the Power of Customer Feedback:**\nIt's disheartening to see that Greater Anglia, and companies like it, seem to neglect the invaluable power of customer feedback and complaints. A well-functioning appeal system should not just serve as a legal formality, but rather as a vital channel for customers to voice their concerns and contribute to the improvement of the service. Just like software updates that fix bugs and enhance user experience, train services should continuously strive to improve their operations based on the input of the very people they serve.\n\nHowever, it appears that some of these companies, including Greater Anglia, behave as if they are infallible gods of the transportation industry, impervious to criticism and customer suggestions. This attitude not only hinders their own growth and development but also perpetuates the cycle of dissatisfaction among passengers who are left feeling unheard and unimportant. It's a missed opportunity to foster trust and build a stronger, more customer-centric service that can meet the ever-evolving needs of travelers.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nIn conclusion, my experience with Greater Anglia train service was a true disappointment. The lack of proper signage, staff assistance, and the nightmarish online ticket purchasing process left me frustrated and disillusioned. It's clear that Greater Anglia prioritizes profits over the well-being and satisfaction of its passengers. If you have other options, I would strongly recommend avoiding this service. It's a stark reminder of the issues plaguing UK transportation services, and it's a shame that more customer-focused alternatives like Apple, Amazon, or Virgin aren't running the show. Going forward use Elizabeth Line to Heathrow Airport will be a better experience.",

Your entire ticketing system and online electronic refund system is woefully inadequate and unfit for purpose!  There are so many bugs, glitches and inconsistencies that I honestly don\u2019t know where to start.  Every week I\u2019m faced with a new challenge.  This latest one has prompted me to write this review and voice my anger.  This weeks frustration is:  my train was delayed so I completed your online compensation claim.  It was rejected as I didn\u2019t have a ticket (of course the ticket barrier does not return your ticket at the end of the journey.  You said that I could submit a copy of my invoice as proof of purchase but there is no option to upload an image on the app.  I therefor manually copied all reference numbers and booking codes and sent those, but as I\u2019ve already provided this information cannot see the use of repeating this.  The annoying thing is that I bought the tickets via the app using your software and your system and provided all booking and reference numbers so surely it\u2019s straight forward for you to see from my account that I did purchase the ticket!  It honestly seems like you are purposefully making it impossible for customers to get a refund in order to maximise profits! Ironically, whenever I change my journey, the system is absolutely brilliant and very consistent in charging me the \u00a310 admin fee.  This part of the system is efficient and flawless!",

On the same trip we flew back into Gatwick, tapped in, got the train to Central London, very fast, very good service, very few stops and it cost \u00a312.\n\nI would love to do a freedom of information search on how many loyal and well intentioned customers who wouldn't dream of trying to travel without a ticket get caught by this Scam.\n\nCome on Greater Anglia, tell us how much you get from this cash cow? \n\nDisgusting!!",

The communication is sometimes appalling. I get it\u2019s not their fault personally, but you\u2019re far more likely to invoke sense of calm and amiable conversation if you\u2019re able to communicate effectively and with some empathy. This line is incredibly expensive in comparison to others, but the new trains are nicer and spacious. However, they have far, far too many staff members at London stations. They stand around chatting and I am unable to fathom what value they\u2019re adding. Fewer unnecessary staff will lead to less of a need for high wage roll - hopefully reflective in the fare. I do not consider GA\u2019s tickets to come with a \u2018price\u2019, but more a \u2018premium\u2019.",

Honestly, I can\u2019t wait for all of the staff to become robots because that will make such a nicer experience than having to deal with incompetent cavemen who just stand there all day and drool staring nihilistically at the work their supposed to be doing and then go on strike. People always say if the conductors arnt checking the tickets then we would need barriers at every station but that\u2019s not true because you could just have barriers than scan your ticket on the doors of the train. Just go up to the door and scan the ticket and if it\u2019s in correct the driver won\u2019t let you on. Or just use the money from the overpriced tickets you sell me and put barriers at every station I\u2019m sure you can afford it. Screw this dog ass train company.

I thought that the trainline would process my refund of \u00a312 but till date there is no refund given by the trainline nor any concerned organisation. I had also applied for refund for the Greater Anglia on 3rd October. But till now there is no single email nor the refund is done. This is really very embarrassing and sad. Millions of people use this app but they are actually doing fraud business by eating peoples hard earned money. I request people to stop using this train Greater Anglia.",

The strikes don't bother me as I just work from home all week which is great. The GA website is still poor with regard to service disruption information. This morning a points failure at Manningtree, fair enough Network Rail's fault and not GA's fault. However, the GA website says...  Disruption details: Cancellations to services at Manningtree. Due to a points failure at Manningtree some lines are blocked. (Fine)\nImpact: Train services running through this station may be cancelled, delayed or revised. Disruption is expected until further notice. (Fine)\nOur advice: Train services through manning are being disrupted due to a points failure. Network Rail engineers are on site investigating. At present the 05:12 Ipswich to Liverpool Street service is being delayed Ipswich until the problem has been resolved. (Not fine). This is not travel advice! e.g., delay your journey until later, do not travel etc. It just repeats the disruption details. They have continued to do this since I last reported it 3 years ago to their customer services so I cannot see them doing the right thing any day soon.",

        "review_text": "Every working day I take the train from Witham to London Liverpool Street. I have a rail card . The app decides to take my rail card off randomly and makes me pay \u00a330 rather then \u00a317 . I normally get on the train and buy my tickets on the way as part of my routine . It's cheaper then tapping in anyway so, I never not buy a ticket . I get fined \u00a350 for a single . The next day there are strikes . I pay \u00a330 again and never get the train home I paid for so have to go to shenfeild where I then pay for an Uber which is another \u00a350 . Im 18 and I've been using this service for 3.5 months and it's been the worst experience and I've wasted so much of my money which I need to move out in a world in which the economy is already so bad . Another point to add is the trains are not smooth . They jolt side to side and sometimes it's worrying because it makes you think the train isn't safe to be on the tracks, plus someone definitely could fall ,or hit their head on the wall when sitting . \n\nThey steal your money to get to work and they don't even provide an experience that's worth the money . Train people who deserve to work on greater Anglia, and sack all the people on strike since there are so many people who would kill for the pay they get .",

        "title": "Attitude problem",
        "review_text": "Today the train driver of the Norwich to Stansted 09:03 train refused to open the doors to the train until 5 minutes before departure. While the crowds on the platform grew he was chatting with his colleague at the end of the train. When I asked if everything was ok, I got a curt \"yeah why?\" reply. I said because the train's due to leave soon but the doors aren't opened and there are crowds building up on the platform. He said his shift hasn't started yet so we have to wait. He spoke quickly and dismissively which betrayed a contemptuous attitude rather than any interest in customer service.\nThe train left on time so there was no issue beyond that but I'm flagging this as what appears to be a growing attitude problem among Greater Anglia staff. While a few months ago the staff at the train station apologised profusely when a storm cancelled the service, such apologies appeared more as thinly veiled virtue posturing for something they clearly could do nothing about. Today's incident, coupled with the increasing strikes (which they only do because they have no competing service) indicates that they are in fact not interested in serving the public but using their privilege to treat their customers like their enemy.",

Bith website and app feel almost as if they were designed to specifically not be user friendly.  The staff are generally friendly and helpful.

It excels at making up excuses based on half-truths and even outright fiction.  It's dismissive, patronising, assumptive, tardy, lazy, cut'n'paste email responses filled with grammatical errors, and the misuse of the English language, are first class examples of how not to run a CS unit.\n\nThey don't even seem to understand the difference in meaning between 'concise' and 'accurate' in emails they sent out.\n\nComplaining to GA is not only a monumental waste of time, but more seriously also dangerous to your blood pressure.\n\nFar better that you simply avoid using their trains wherever remotely possible.  Walk, crawl on your hands and knees, hitch a lift on a passing snail, do whatever you can not to use GA. That way you will save yourself an infinity of misery.",

        "title": "DREADFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE",
        "review_text": "My sister and I had bought tickets for the 09.35 train from Clacton-on-Sea to London Liverpool Street recently,  as we were due to start a holiday from St Pancras International. We were, with other passengers, standing by the normal gate at 09.22. We were all a bit confused as the indicator board was showing the next train was at 10.35, but there was no announcement made telling us that the 09.35 had been cancelled or that it was running from a different platform. Eventually one of the other passengers ran into the ticket office, only to be told \"oh well the train is just leaving from a platform at the back a of the station and we had needed to use a different gate\" Therefore at least  8-10 passengers missed the train. Because my sister and I could not wait for the next train from Clacton, we had no choice but to pay \u00a365 for a taxi, to catch a train further down the line. Sadly all GA Customer Services are offering is an apology and a load of excuses. They have said they will look at 'possibly'refunding our ticket. What an absolute disgraceful service, we came very close to missing our holiday and this completely messed the beginning of it for us; we were so stressed. How do they have the cheek to advertise and try encourage people to use their service.",

The ticket collector came along,  refused to believe the story and even insinuated I was lying saying he was on the platform before the train left and I hadn't spoken to anyone.

I was also warned that they will claim they never received them so send recorded delivery/signed for. As predicted they say they never received them, also claiming that the trains were not cancelled even though they emailed to say they would be. I have sent in evidence of posting from Royal Mail (screenshots showing signature from person signing), email confirming trains cancelled etc. Now, I actually support the industrial action and believe the staff are unfairly treated by GA. I can only assume that the staff are overstretched, possibly directed by management to make these excuses etc. Staff I deal with at the stations are nothing but polite and friendly - this is not an attack on individuals but GA management as a whole.",

Obviously there is always room for improvement, but compared to what trains used to be like, it has significantly improved.\n\nThe train stock for Greater Anglia has been updated, which means electric doors, improved signage, seat capacity, where toilets and beverage carriages are located. The trains are very clean, spacious and various features such as free WiFi, which makes quite a big difference.\n\nStaff are generally polite and helpful. For example, I left my phone on a train yesterday from a London Liverpool service to Norwich (I left at Ipswich), and I went to visit the station it terminated at the following day in Norwich - I found a help desk, and the staff were extremely helpful in finding my phone and doing their due diligence checks to make sure I was the right owner, before handing it over to me.\n\nThe Norwich train from Ipswich was extremely pleasant with smiling and helpful staff. Thank you for working hard on the travel experience for passengers, even if our train system is a bit higgledy-piggledy.",

So on pay day decide to advance purchase my ticket. Only to find out the next day that the train drivers decided to go on strike on 13th!! Fabulous I thought.... I didn't overly panic. I have the app & thought it would be easy to get my money back. Ummmmmm NO!!! So they wanted \u00a310 admin fee for me cancelling \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb obviously the only reason I was cancelling was because I couldn't physically go because of the strike. So then myself & my friend decided we'd go on the 14th instead. This should be easy I thought... the app gave me an option to change date & time. I clicked on the tiny button. It flashed up that this option wasn't available to me!!! Wrong answer Greater Anglia.  The next day I phone customer services.  Oh what joy this was NOT!! Not too sure where that office is, but its another country. The lady who I spoke to for 13 minutes offered me absolutely nothing. I really tried not to be rude, but I lost my temper as she kept putting me on hold. When I wasn't on hold she wasn't actually saying anything. I had to keep saying \"hello\" after 13 minutes of no help whatsoever I lost the will to live & hung up. I called back the next day, spoke to a man who was more helpful.  Saud I could have a refund & waiver the \u00a310 admin fee. Like he was doing me a favour!!!! But at least he was more help than the moron the day before. I complained to the man about the previous conversation.  I suggested she gets more training. So disappointed with Greater Anglia & especially their inept app  I would just like to say my friend uses the Train Line app & had no issues getting a full refund. I really didn't need all the stress I got  it wasmy fault I couldn't travel on a certain day. Yet they wanted money for that privilege \ud83d\ude44 sort it out please. I've now deleted the app & downloaded Train Line.",

Staff can be very lazy at the ticket booth and they actually suggest going to the electronic booth (so I can\u2019t understand why the booth stays open if they don\u2019t wish to work it). \nMost times, there are train issues every other morning with the most excuses I\u2019ve ever heard for a service. You are better off with the C2C if you don\u2019t need the greater Anglia. Staff who check tickets can be very rude too. This is an outdated process for the 21st century (sorry to those that work this job) but it\u2019s not needed. Most of us do buy a ticket!! It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if these staff were kinder and didn\u2019t treat every passenger like a criminal or get sarcastic when asked a question. Overall, I\u2019m celebrating that my time with the greater Anglia is coming to a close. Unfortunately with all the strikes and broken down trains I\u2019ve had to relocate my job.",

This is by far the worst train experience I have ever had. I have 2 children under 3, we got on the train, there was broken glass on the floor, empty alcohol bottles everywhere, spilt alcohol on the floor (of which I have pictures to back all of this up & they have CCTV on the trains so they can back up themselves. I didn't dare take my kids out of the pushchair because it was so disgusting, we had no other choice but to get on to get home bcause it was the last train and with two under 3 i'm not walking about somewhere i don't know late at night! I never expected the train would be in such a state! \n\n I quote an email from Greig the senior customer relations manager 'I am extremely sorry for the poor experience which you had whilst travelling with us. I can confirm that feedback was passed to the train presentation team in relation to this matter as I do agree this would make for an unpleasant journey.\n\nI can advise that we do not compensate for this type of issue, as you were still able to complete your journey successfully and no refund would be due for the tickets you purchased as your journey was neither delayed or cancelled, which would have meant that you were entitled to a refund as a result.\n\nI do hope that this incident does not deter you from travelling with us again in future. Should you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me again.' \n\nI even spoke to another staff member before that who emailed me much the same thing, then when I emailed back saying that is not good enough ignored my email completely until i chased them again a couple of weeks later asking to speak to his manager. & as you can see he didn't care much either. That is the kind of experience you can expect I guess looking at the rest of these reviews. Worst service I have ever experienced in my life, I will be telling everyone I know & every place I can possibly review to not waste their money on the company.",

        "review_text": "I have been travelling on this train line for 35 years and have paid a full annual season ticket renewing on time every year, other than during COVID lockdown. \n\nFollowing the recent strike upheaval and surrounding days, I travelled to London the following week, and it slipped my mind that my annual season ticket had expired the day before I travelled. I would have thought as I am logged into the GA app, I would have received some kind of reminder, anyway that aside, I travelled to London on the 5am train and when I got to Liverpool Street the rude and obnoxious ticket inspector insisted on giving me a penalty fare, even though I said I would renew my ticket there and then in front of him! \n\nI have since appealed twice and both have been upstanding of the inspectors decision. It is not the cost of the \u00a338 fine, it is the principle. I pay almost \u00a35,000 per year for a train line with poor service, regular disruption for maintenance work and most recently strikes and upheaval surrounding these days. \n\nOther than less than 50% refund for strike days I am not aware of any other type of compensation? I often see fare dodgers on the train and when approached the inspectors are clearly scared to issue them with a penalty fare as they just take the price of the ticket, however a 35 year commuter who has never previously travelled without a ticket [ and I note neither have my family] makes a one off genuine human error following a week of crap service is treated like a common criminal!!! \n\nI can only assume the inspectors are on some kind on commission for these penalty fares. The not so funny thing about this is when you get to Liverpool St there is often 5-10 inspectors/assistants standing around talking, no wonder the ticket prices are astronomical, we are paying their wages! \n\nThe quicker I do not need the use this poorly run line the better and would recommend anyone with another option [C2C] not to do so.",

        "review_text": "The treatment of customers by greater anglia is terrible and the worst part is that they don't care at all. \n\nWe arrived at Stanstead after paying contactless from a London station. Upon arrival we saw that a physical ticket was required and that contactless wasn't valid, which weren't informed of. Nevertheless we purchased a physical ticket at the station to make up for having used the wrong payment method.\n\nWe were refused the right to exit the station into the airport, despite being in a rush for a plane, and told we needed to buy a ticket (at a highly inflated price) AND pay a fine. We argued and mentioned that there had been no real guidance or information available at any of the stations to explain what type of ticket was needed but the employees essentially laughed at us and told us that it was our own fault. They said contactless wasn't a valid payment option because we weren't in London (despite the airport being called London stanstead). Why would they even let us on the train with contactless if it wasn't a valid payment option? \n\nUpon arguing, the employee there actually admitted that it was a bad system for customers but that the company use it to make extra revenue, essentially admitting that they were scamming customers age intentionally relying on a lack of information to gain extra money from people. There were about 6 people in front of us with the exact same issue and it seems from reviews that this is a regular occurance at the station. The company clearly does not care about ripping people off or they would have addressed it by now. \n\nWe appealed the fines and were denied, with the copy and paste response stating that it was our responsibility to somehow know every rule of every train station in London before travelling. \n\nI'd strongly recommend not travelling with greater anglia and just taking a coach or bus instead, it will save you money, you'll have a better experience based on the lack of interaction with greater anglia staff, and youll be more likely to make your plane on time because you can skip the queues of people as they get scammed at the station.",

I said but have brought my ticket he said I will have to issue you with a new one at \u00a336 ? I said but that's thats basically what I paid for a return. How can one way be that much?

        "review_text": "This is the second time Greater Anglia you simply just fail on any form of customer services and refuse paying what you so bravely say you will!\nWon\u2019t go onto the 1st time now, as it\u2019s too long of a story! \nYet\u2026let\u2019s go on my newest attempt to get some money back from GA which they clearly avoid paying again! \nOn the 2nd of December my husband and I were meant to get on a train from Liverpool St, which was cancelled, nearly 1 hour later we boarded a train that was meant to take us home, yet after another 15-20 minutes, we were kicked out of the train and told this will train got cancelled as well. \nGot another train eventually, and made it back home in over 2 hrs instead of 30 minutes. \nAnyways, decided to use the Delay Repay Service, that we clearly are entitled to and claim a refund for both of us, using the Delay Repay service! \nAny normal human being, would simply expect to get their money back, but this is not the case when it comes to GA! \nThey simply avoid paying by any means.\nI was using a normal paper ticket, and my claim got rejected due to apparently being paid to someone else! I simply wonder who might have access to my paper ticket other than myself?!? Won\u2019t point fingers, but I simply doubt anyone else other than a staff member could have my paper ticket serial number! \nBut this is not it!\nMy husband was using a rail card , filled in the exact same form myself , with his details instead of mine! \nAnd don\u2019t be surprised to find out that his claim was rejected also as apparently his journey details were incorrect! \nSo in a nutshell, I won\u2019t get my money back as they found the journey but \u201cpaid\u201d someone else instead! My husband won\u2019t be paid as the exact same journey was not found?!?\nDoesn\u2019t this sound to you more of a way to simply avoid paying? \nWill take this and our previous claim to the newspaper\u2019s, and to the Ombudsman hoping that maybe eventually someone at Greater Anglia will wake up and realise they simply can\u2019t endlessly fail on customer services without any consequences! \nThank you once again Greater Anglia for demonstrating what the worse possible customer services looks like!",

This time from 8 trips, used only 2, asked for my refund 10 days ago, with full details.  Nothing. I work from home too as many of my colleagues: we deal with emails, requests, claims, calls in REAL time. No 5-10 working days wait!!! Why?  And they (GA) are not alone.  Holidays are coming, need extra money, but no reply from GA, no refund.  Not so keen to keep their  promises, I guess, all that TV ads cost a lot. Thank you for refunding me ASAP. 10.12.2021",

They were apologetic as they confirmed that Ely ticket office should have done this for me already.\n- The following day I turned up at Ely station and they had not been sent an email, they phoned Greater Anglia and it was confirmed that the member of staff had forgotten to send the email.\n- Despite my son\u2019s season ticket appearing on his Greater Anglia account when he logs in online they apparently have no record of it or of the transaction, even though they can see the season ticket on his account, so they refuse to do anything more to help.\n\nThe system just doesn\u2019t work at all, there is no joined up thinking, no customer service, no staff training and no ability to help customers or replace lost season tickets.\n\nAfter 2 weeks of trying to get this sorted I have finally given up - the system is broken!",

I then contacted greater anglia by email to claim my refund and after 2 weeks I go a reply saying they would look into the reasons why the train was cancelled and get back to me. Quite frankly I dont care why it was cancelled I just want to be refunded my \u00a3120 taxi fare. Their reply implied I was lying about the cancelled train, whereas  surely they should know what trains they have cancelled. I'm still waiting for my refund. Very poor customer service.",

The rest I have encountered are rude, unhelpful and just want to be chatting to their chums or be on a mobile phone. That's if there are members of staff not to help you, sometimes there is not a single member of staff. \n\nI now do not travel on the GA service for days out as a majority of the weekends have maintenance on at least one part of the track which means I have to take a replacement bus for the same price. Strange how during work time and non holidays the service is up because they can fleece the workforce out of thousands. \n\nLots of stations are not manned after a certain time so people can travel free and it's annoying when you need help but they have all gone home to bed. Lovely service. Thanks for your lack of customer service.\n\nI travel mostly by bus at weekends as it is cheaper and most of the time I will have to anyway with rail works. I can understand all the negativity and hostile reviews towards this company as they richly deserve them and are a horrendous company where we are not customers, just statistics. Don't bother with legitimate refunds as the hassle is not worth it. Just find out what stations are often not manned and have a few freebies.\n\nUpdate on 19/12/22",

One can wait at the small station for at least an hour.\n\nThe cherry on top is the fact they have the audacity to increase the price in January whilst the service slowly worsens, year in, year out. **Whilst wages stagnate.** The new trains STILL breakdown despite the annual price hike. Complaints too are met with dismissive and patronising responses.\n\nIf a nobody in a track suit did to my money what these guys do every year they'd be put away - and rightly so.",

Secondly, they then rejected the claim as I had not added the entire journey from Paignton to Bishops Stortford rather than just the segment which was delayed. The website would not allow me to add my journey, because although I had taken a perfectly valid route on an advance ticket, there search facility would only find journeys via Westbury, which meant I could not add the journey as per the ticket.\n\nThis website is awful and the customer service in processing the delays could be said to be purposely awkward to discourage customers from having to ever make a claim thereby saving money for the TOC.",

The station is huge; I was very overwhelmed and confused I asked this lady at bishop stortford it was around 7.53 this Morning! I wish I got her name! She was a blonde lady and had her hair in a pony tail! She was soo helpful told me exactly when the train was coming and what platform it would be on! She told me to wait in the comfortable waiting room where I had a lovely hot chocolate and the man who made it was delightful too! She then came and collected me before my train was arriving and told me to have a lovely day! These people never get enough recognition! Thankyou! X",

        "review_text": "Absolutely disgusting service!\n\nI appreciate that things go wrong sometimes, especially in bad weather conditions, but the way passengers were treated yesterday at Harlow Town is an absolute disgrace. No information whatsoever, the staff locked themselves in the closet, after a while they came out panicked giving the misleading advice, like: take taxi, don't travel, or go to Stansted (but figure yourself out how-to). We later learned that we would not be reimbursed for the cars that we organized ourselves. Phone line? Forget it, if you get through, you could only get some BS from the script. No practical information on how to get home at all. There were families with kids, young teenagers left out in the middle of the night at the station which (as if it wasn't enough) was surrounded by sketchy individuals that security was helpless about...\nAbsolute lack of crisis management skills, every respectable business can at least put a minimum effort into this.\n\nTheir motto is \"Travel with confidence\". I'd add: \"Travel with confidence that we do not care\".",

We were dumped along with so many other people (also families with toddlers) in Harlow Town on the 25th July at 7pm with no replacement busses or information on how to get back home. \n\nWe were advised to get a taxi and claim the money back. After calling customer service line, we were told that we wouldn't get the full refund for the taxi which at that time was 300 pounds!\n\nThe customer service staff at the station were advised by management to tell passengers to \"not travel\". We were told that the management called an emergency \"conference call\" but no information whatsoever about what was decided. No information about the replacement busses. No communication. \n\nI feel for the customer service staff at the station as they didn't receive any useful advice from the top management and couldn't help.\n\nThe worst service ever.

We helped him and lots of female students and 2 young female Dr's, we got them to stay with us as they were very distressed, in total around 30 plus people were still at the station, my friend managed to get taxis sorted via Billy at greater anglia,for the remaining public only to be REFUSED by the 'staff member' at Harlow Town Station, I tried all local taxi firms, rang young coaches and Greater anglia 0345 number(spoke with the amazing Billy) as did my my friend, the Staff member at Harlow lied saying we were getting a coach, but nothing was arranged, I had to arrange it myself, only 2 coaches had been allocated but not to come to Harlow!! Greater Anglia have no respect for the public at all, they just want the money, and they need to sort out customer service training for their staff members!!! Not happy at all!!",

        "review_text": "We were supposed to travel with the last service from Sheringham to Cambridge via Norwich. Due to an accident at a level crossing between Salhouse and Hoveton & Wroxham, the service was cancelled at the last minute. The digital info board displayed a \"limited bus replacement\" service (whatever that meant). It wasn't clear when and from where that bus would depart.\n\nMinutes later, we noticed a bus in the nearby station, operated by Sanders Coaches, which ended up super-crowded (dubbed the COVID-bus by one of the passengers). Initially, we thought it was the replacement service and got on in a hurry. The driver did not answer our question regarding this detail, just bluntly stating how much we have to pay. With many tourists travelling from Sheringham and Cromer to Norwich, the bus was so crowded that after a while it did not stop, so many people (possibly some of them were regular commuters?) were left in the bus stations between Cromer and Norwich (I feel sorry for them). Of course, the 44A service is not passing near the Norwich train station and on top of that had a slight delay, so we got off at the closest bus stop and tried to run to the train station, arriving at 22:43, so just missing the last train service to Cambridge by 3 minutes.\n\nI explained our situation to a young lady at the Greater Anglia info desk. No questions asked, she said she will call us a taxi, just wait on the benches. After around half an hour, a taxi was waiting for us, so we got back to Cambridge just 40 minutes later than expected. Given the confusion around the replacement bus service, we were kind of put up with the idea that we will have to sort out our journey back for ourselves (apparently something that the other passengers did). It was a huge and pleasant surprise to hear that Greater Anglia will ensure that we reach our destination.\n\nWould like to say a big thank you to the young lady and gentleman who were at the info desk in Norwich Station on the night of 17 July 2021 and sorted things out while keeping us updated. We have used Greater Anglia services many dozens of times, and it was the first time we faced a train cancellation. We're glad that they stepped in and made an extra effort to get us home safely (they could simply say: sorry).",

This train was then further delayed by a couple of minutes. I managed to get to Shenfield where I had to change for a train to Chelmsford. At Shenfield, there was no information whatsoever of where I had to board the train to Chelmsford. When I boarded the Chelmsford train, I was forced to stand due to a lack of available seats. \n\nWhen I was coming back from Chelmsford, the train arriving for London was delayed. To my surprise, the train was packed as there was a signalling fault in Norwich. I couldn't find a seat once I boarded the train so I had to stand. The train then stopped at Ingatestone which was an non-intended stop. This was due to a fault with the tracks at the level crossing. \n\nThe fare which I paid for my journey to and from Chelmsford does not reflect the standard of the service which Greater Anglia offers. Instead this service is more of a reflection of how trains run in a third world improvised country.",

        "review_text": "WHERE DO I START\n\nGreater Anglia, bad service \nDirty trains \nHigh prices for a bad service \nI regularly commute from Stratford to Colchester, and the trains are non stop filthy, strong smell of wee, sticky floors and a avalanche of dust when you sit on the seats!!! The ticket inspectors talk down to you and honestly they need to be sacked. The other day a ticket inspector got on at shenfield, she was very rude, has short hair(purple colour) and she aggressively asked me for my ticket and she was not even wearing a mask!! If I could give this 0 stars I would, ticket inspectors are rude! \nTrains are old \nDon\u2019t wear your best outfit because it will get covered in dust when you sit down. Their are always delayed, cancellations. Oh yeah a person got hit by a train at Chelmsford around 11PM I was travelling back from Colchester to Stratford, and their was no trains going to Liverpool st, a lot of people were stranded as they were not providing a rail replacement bus and only a small minority of Colchester taxis were willing to drive to London. \n\nI hope greater Anglia go buss and fail!!",

They deny refund claims when their service is awful  - filthy trains, delays, cancellations, power hungry, bullied in school ticket inspectors who talk down to you.

Figuring out the optimal fare was, I must admit, an arduous task at the beginning because we had London zones 3-6 to be added to the mix.  After quite a few conversations with GA phone support, figured out paper travelcard was the only way which must be bought each time in person from a station. Barring that one inconvenience, his experience of greater anglia so far has been great. and as for me, i have so far contacted them twice , once  for delay refund claim . I filled the form online which was acknowledged same day and refund processed next day. Next we bought one month ticket in advance  and then government announced staggered return so we were informed he would be starting school a week later. I contacted GA via email, they responded quickly , offered full refund and advised the best way to obtain the new ticket. I was asked to cut my ticket in half and send image to them. I did as advised and refund was processed immediately.\nThank you Rachael , Vivyan and others from Greater Anglia customer service team for your brilliant support.",

When I approached a ticket guard I was aggressively told that I would have to be charged a penalty for travelling without a ticket. No understanding and no discretion.

        "review_text": "I made an honest mistake,travelling from Brentwood  to Chelmsford. I hardly ever go to Chelmsford, I usually go to Romford,and forgot  the zone finishes at Shenfield. Then it's Greater Anglian, Joy! I went to tap out with my bank card, and when it didn't  work wondered why. I turned around  to  speak to one of the 3 staff standing  around and one walked away! I managed to drag the other one away from chatting  and found out my card wouldn't  work because I was out of the tfl zone, in Chelmsford.I was told I had to pay a penalty fare. I tried to explain that I haven't  been to Chelmsford in over a year and just forgot,offering to buy a return ticket at the ticket  office.The staff can use their discretion,( I read later) but there was no chance of this. I was polite, giving my correct details, the employee said I stood a good chance of not paying the fine ,as I didn't  have any previous fines....surprise! He said he had to treat everyone the same, but if you do that, you cannot \nuse your discretion! I  just received a standard  e-mail response to my appeal declining it. They clearly are just out to get as much money  as possible, and there is NO room for manoeuvre. Maybe if I was the Queen? I dislike this non customer  service intensely. I think the staff have too much time on their hands,as they were all standing about,and I hope they get taken  over by a better company, to put it mildly.Yes, they don't  even deserve one star.",

There was no heating on and one toilet for 10 carriages. I think the train was about 1950's all battered outside and filthy.I assume that the shiny new electric trains have packed up. Apparently all available drivers had gone over their hours due to massive signalling problems all day so nobody was available to drive our train - yet someone was driving it and he just got off and vanished.\nThere were 6 seats for all of the elderly, disabled and those with young children - 3 if they socially distanced and it was freezing standing on the platform. Nobody came to help us or tell us what was going on.\nEventually, we spotted an off duty staff member and he helped us!! 10/10 he was so caring when nobody else was! He was googling what was going on himself! A train came into the station and was commandeered to take us to Ipswich - but those going to Norwich would have to get off at Ipswich.\nA driver volunteered to drive the train although he had gone over his hours and would be stuck in Ipswich when he didn't live there. 10/10 to them and 0/10 for Greater Anglia.\nSo we managed to get home 4 hour hours after we left London!! It used to take an hour with steam trains in Victorian times.",

And that I should have read about it online before travel with a smile on her face.\n\nLining up behind me were another 10 people who did the same thing. Standard Express /greater anglia employees gave a business as usual explanation to everyone, cashing in at every turn. Clearly this is not a one off mistake and Stansted express are making substantial sums with this strategy.\n\nI understand that there may be some cost to paying at the airport but doubling the price is a rouse to extorting poor customers who were simply not informed with signs. A fiver would have been acceptable but doubling is extortionate.\n\nGreater Anglia have not provided a refund as they are an effective monopoly and can do whatever they wish.",

The online form l completed was filled out exactly as requested because otherwise it would not accept submission. I was then called approximately 28 days later by a lady to take my card details that l had already provided. She said she knew nothing about how long my refund would take and that all she had was a list of telephone numbers to call. Disappointed but understanding l wanted. Having read the GA website a number of times l took into account that it said l should wait up to a maximum 56 \u2018calendar days\u2019 before receiving said refund. Having not done so l called customer service who told me that it was in fact 56 working days not calendars day and she apologised for the websites inaccurate information. 2 weeks later l then receive an email saying that there has been a delay because l didn\u2019t submit the photo of my ticket initially, well sorry GA but lm absolutely certain that l did, what was more worrying though was the fact that they again asked for my card details, telephone number for the 3rd time and the station l bought the ticket from a 2nd time. I\u2019m sorry GA but it\u2019s absolutely apparent that you are either losing/lost most of the information people have sent to you or you have the least integrated departmental systems that l have ever heard of, especially considering its 2020, not 1980. I\u2019ve always been happy with your train service, and even though 80% of the staff l encounter at Liverpool Street station are unhelpful. However, whilst lm willing to be flexible given the situation it seems as though you are staggering your financial loses.

As per the website and what was told I should have received the refund in up to 28 days. Obviously since then GA will have received an increased number of refund requests for season tickets. They have not yet updated the website and not updated anyone with outstanding claims regarding revised timescales.\nI waited until the 28 days have passed, and have so far spoken to 3 different call centre staff, been given 3 different updated time frames (1 of which has now also passed), and been advised I will get a call back twice and not received that call back. So at the moment I don't know when I am likely to get the refund, and don't really believe my refund is being processed at all.\nUnderstand things are tough for everyone at the moment, but this is still the worst customer experience I have ever had. And what takes so long giving a refund when the card has been returned, what is there that needs checking?",

Trains are absolutely filthy, there are cancellations left,right & centre, and land slips is another one,you couldn't make it up if you tried. I don't know what's Great about Greater Anglia, but they should be made to hand the keys/service back & put it back in house, GA are just a rip off to its travellers, they don't care,they are just a private revenue company that shouldn't excist. Oh one more thing,the GA advert on TV,which tells us \" Its Happening \"  fare rises, cancellations, land slips,poor service, dirty trains, shut downs, rail replacement services, broken down trains and GA customers that are treated like cattle. I would rate GA minus rating, but i don't think I'm the only one. Come back British Rail or even Hornby could do it better.......",

The worst part is pure LACK of communication. This morning the train was delayed but you couldn't hear what the driver was saying as the speaker was broken, which is the same on most GA trains. These trains are every 30 mins, so if one is cancelled or delayed it really messes up your day. I am sick of the high prices for an absolutely appalling service. Tonight they decided to change my train coming home so that it didn't stop at Seven Sisters,  which was a last minute decision and totally messed me up getting home to collect my 6 year old daughter. Overall it's a SLOW, DIRTY, UNRELIABLE service, and they should not be able to retain their contract.",

        "review_text": "I moved to Ipswich recently after living in the Midlands for years.  I thought the Virgin service from London to Birmingham International was unreliable, my God compared to the service from London to Ipswich, it was amazing.   The Greater Anglia service is very expensive and over the last few weeks at least 50% of the trains I have travelled on have been delayed and look like something from the 1950\u2019s.   There was some joy on Tuesday morning when a new train arrived to take us to London but that joy passed as it broke down on what seemed like its maiden voyage and we were stranded for 7 hours close to Stratford. My awful experience reaches new heights when I left my phone on the train last night. Having immediately realised my error I was not permitted to re-board the train to collect it and had to watch the train pull into the sidings as it was the last train home.  I got up this morning at 430am and went to the station to retrieve my phone (tracked on find my IPhone) before the train left.  I was told that my phone wasn\u2019t on the train despite showing the customer service individual that it was there as shown live on my Mac using the find my iPhone app.  He said that he could not retrieve it and I\u2019d have to wait till Monday morning even though we could see the train from the platform.  Thankfully a generous cleaner overheard our conversation and through his own initiative retrieved my phone.   Greater Anglia you are a comedic enterprise masquerading as a legitimate business.

        "review_text": "Our morning train got cancelled due to a 'train fault' the other week, and we were asked to wait for the bus. Even though there were a few seats spare on it, the driver only allowed one person on and then drove away. As this was not a manned station (but apparently one of the busiest for morning commutes), we did not know if another bus was coming. Many of us pressed the green Help button at the information stand, but only I was able to be transferred to the Greater Anglia helpline. Apparently they had \"lost\" the bus, but we were reassured that it was still coming.\n\nWe stood in the (very cold) wind and rain, and when it did eventually turn up, we had been waiting for an hour and a half. Everyone was late for work, one person was on their last warning from their employer over lateness due to the trains, and we were soaked through. When the first bus got to the destination station, someone asked if the other bus was on its way. The response? \"They should have called our helpdesk and we would have arranged a taxi\". At no point during any of our attempts to do so was a taxi offered. It never is. There is sometimes a suggestion that we should just phone one ourselves, but that just diverts the blame. Why should we pay out of our own pocket when we have already paid for season tickets? I appreciate that traffic can cause a bus to be late, but no one at Greater Anglia seemed to know what was going on.\n\nThis happens on the regular- no they will not help, so we should wait an undetermined amount time until the next one comes. Even worse, there have been many occasions when they know well in advance that it is going to be cancelled, yet they still refuse to sort out alternative transport.",

Even tho we were due in well over an hour before that time! \n\nThen on the return journey home the train left norwich on time but kept us held up in Wroxham for over 40 minutes before we could carry on with our journey! The amount the public has to pay in ticket fares does not match up to the standard of customer care and the quality of the service we get! Totally let down by a service that clearly has respect or interest in letting us know what is going on! The lack of information given just shows that the train service is only interested in profit than the level of quality and care given to its users! \n\nI for one will be giving this service a wide birth from now on!

At least 30 degrees in summer and below freezing in winter.

Or like today, constant notifications of delay followed by reassurance from staff the train is coming to be told its cancelled. So there will be a replacement bus service you assume? No too late notice... But f*** your paying customers. You know if a train is coming or not, the least you can do is be straight with customers from the start so we can make plans. So as I say people, use Greater Anglia as a last resort. Either bus to Chelmsford or 133 to Stansted and a coach to Stratford/express into London. Much more reliable services, more aggrovation but at least you know it'll happen.\n\nGreater Anglia can be described best as unreliable and overpriced. Avoid where possible. They'll likely reply but the same poor service has gone on for years, they obviously need a big staff shake up.",

OK, there were the usual delays, filthy carriages and sky high fares  when I travelled to Nottingham and back, but we come to expect this,\nMy gripe is to do with the mobile app and the electronic ticket wallet. Naively, I accidentally activated my return ticket yesterday for travel today. Having realised my mistake I contacted the company, only to be treated like a piece of dirt and handed round to various departments. I was told that I would have to purchase a new ticket with no goodwill shown on their part. However, East Midlands Rail Company station staff came to the rescue and allowed me to travel when I explained the problem. Greater Anglia, you need to treat your passengers with more respect.",

        "review_text": "I boarded a train at Braintree station at 5.43am as I needed to be in Canary Wharf before 8am. What a nightmare I didn't know that you have to change at witham for a train to Stratford sitting in the dark at the side of tracks on an empty train. So I called customer service who advised that they would have to call me back. Anyway got a call back to say that I would have to wait until 7am before I could get off, then train wouldn't be pulling in until Colchester and I would need to pay to get back. I'm am now sitting at witham to get back to Braintree and no train until 8.35. Why could they have not pulled train forward so I could get off.  I'm not impressed as always a delay or something on Greater Anglia and customers pay enough for a shoddy service.",

I was met by the most rude train conductor who had no empathy towards the situation ( I did get upset and I did swear but not in an aggressive way ) and was then confronted by him explaining that if I swear I will be arrested at the next stop ! ( at no point have I been aggressive was just rather frustrated and upset ) - I was made to get off at stowmarket station there was no waiting area, it was dark out side and freezing cold and was told to man up as my train is in an hour! - honestly not surprised that this Trainline has a 1 star review as the staff are extremely rude! If I was asked nicely to leave the train there would have been no issue but the manner in which I was spoken to by a grown man who in his words called it \u201chis train\u201d was disgusting! Sorry would like to see the evidence that he In fact owns the train please ? shambles of a trainline, my safety was put at risk, I am a 21 year old girl left on my own at a place I\u2019ve never been because I got an earlier train that what i had booked!

However, here especially greater anglia is rubbish! So old fashioned! So many staff giving you so many different information! \nIt is so complicated to order your ticket online you are given like hundreds of options! Then that\u2019s not enough you get asked to print out your ticket which adds up to 10 little cards are that are so easy to loose or get dropped, wed, damaged or chewed by your dog! It is not environmentally friendly either! To make the things more interesting they do not give you the option to reprint your tickets even though you have all the details on your email! Why not send it to your phones wallet !? Or reprint? It is so backwards! Catch up with technology greater anglia! \nThe customer service is so rubbish you cannot even get your say across!

How can this be safe or legal?\n\nThe return journey can be worse. On one recent Sunday, train crew were unable to separate two trains so taxis were ordered in an entirely random way. Bizarrely train staff didn't inform passengers this was happening until the taxis arrived. It's either very poor customer service or staff couldn't care less.",

Passengers were just supposed to find a way of getting to their destination, no replacement buses, endless queues for private taxis in temps of 38C! After having arrived at the station at 3.00 pm, it took me 2 hours to find a taxi to get home and I was charged \u00a330. I very much doubt that I will be given a refund by you! Trains in India work better than they do in the UK and contend with much higher temps. I pay a premium to travel on a daily basis from Audley end to Cambridge, yet you let down all your customers on Thursday because of your lack of forethought and planning.

I have travelled extensively by train around the world and have never encountered any worse than this. \n\nI'm writing this review just a couple of hours after my incident with Greater Anglia. I landed at Stansted Airport, went to the train station to catch a train to Cambridge. I thought it would be a direct journey, with no stops. The guy who sold me the ticket didn't tell me I would have to get off at one stop and catch another train to Cambridge. On top of this, there were no notifications, signs or anything on the train informing passengers travelling to Cambridge to get off at the next stop. Nothing. As a result, I ended up in Liverpool Street, London, at 1:00am where I am now. Next train to Cambridge is at 4:00am. Any serious, modern train company would inform passengers of the itinerary to their destination including stops. Not Greater Anglia. Trains in third world countries work better than this. What a shame to the UK to have such a terrible train company. Absolutely terrible!!!",

You have to wait until 8am to speak to someone and they will argue that despite hundreds trying to get taxis, even with no cash on you, you should be able to get a taxi at 2/3/4 am to do a 100 mile run home. Oh, and having no coats as it the summer, not enough foil blankets. Apparently how can tney prepare for that!!! I know primary school children that could do a better job than you.

        "review_text": "This trustpilot review is exposing the true nature of Abellio Greater Anglia and why you should not apply for a career with them.\n\nAbellio is advertising jobs but the website has scarce information on culture, experience required or company values.\n\nSo I googled and found some Abellio staff offering advice, unofficially on job seeker sites.\n\nI posted a Q&A thread with concerns I'd found reviews and proof on social media that Abellio's Recruitment drive was tainted by nepotism (only hiring close family members, friends or associates), hiring cronies and undesirables (some have confirmed criminal records) who bully fellow staff. This is backed by former workers on glassdoor and other job review websites.\n\n(I cannot post links to external websites)\n\nAs you would've seen the responses, staff hired by Abellio Greater Anglia, not only didn't answer these accusations, but they confirmed it with hostility from behind a keyboard.\nThey also used derogatory discriminating language against Disabled people.\n\nOne person claiming to be a Greater Anglia employee, thinks that free speech or questioning potential workplace bribery within Abellio is \"trolling\" and that Abellio's recruitment process is beyond scrutiny.\n\nI have tagged Abellio Greater Anglia, whom are still owned by the Dutch based Operator until 2025 (and their legal trading name is still \"Abellio Greater Anglia\"). Their replacement fleet of STADLER trains were manufactured in Switzerland coming in from Europe. Greater Anglia purposefully chose the EU based STADLER over the British based manufacturer Bombardier.\nThis is despite Bombardier offering their services and contracts as a British Manufacturer, which were shunned by Abellio Greater Anglia in 2016. \nBombardier had proven they can successfully manufacture new trains with London's Crossrail trains in 2014 in the UK.\n\nGreater Anglia and it's staff (owned by the Dutch Government Abellio brand until 2025) recieved \u00a32.5 Billion (yes \u00a32.5 Billion) of money from the European Union so are staff who benefit from being in the EU.\nSo would Abellio staff also refrain from posting anti-EU and Pro-Brexit comments on their Facebooks while revealing they publicly work for Abellio Greater Anglia on social media.",

(Interestingly no ticket inspection on board) Greater Anglia are efficient at taking your money, less so at providing what you've paid for. I'd suggest if you are thinking of travelling 1st Class DON'T BUY YOUR TICKET IN ADVANCE. Check at the station prior to travel that the service IS ACTUALLY OPERATING before parting with your money.",

Recently they announced that they are restricting the number of full size bikes allowed on my route due to new trains having reduced capacity, this for trains into Cambridge where there are more bikes than cars. Add to that their inability to transport lost items to a nearer station than the station where it was discovered and a \u00a310 courier fee if you can't pick it up. Adding to all the above there is a severe lack of consistency in their operation, the trains are late, shortened (sometimes to 1/3rd their normal length which is too short anyway) or cancelled.\n\n The government is supposed to be against monopolies but every region has a 1.

The 1st class section consisted of identical seats to second class, but with 1st class labelling. No comfort, no wi-fi, no power source for laptops of phones, no refreshments, no staff, no apology. I asked what was going on at Norwich and a member of staff just said, the first class are at the front and offered no explanation. A muffled announcement at Norwich mentioned something about repairs to trains meant there had to be a change. I couldn't really hear. I didn't take a book as I had intended to use the wi -fi and use my computer. That is why I booked first class in the first place. So I sat unproductive, bored and grumpily wondered why this had happened and why nothing was said. Incidentally, at Norwich station all the coffee shops had pretty much closed, (before 1800) but I didn't worry too much because there's always  the buffet ..or not!\nVery poor train service, customer service by rail staff and general communication. I don't suppose there will be any recompense.",

However, in January my outbound trains were on time only 4 times.  How can that be acceptable?\n\nWhen there are delays over a certain time, then they just cancel the train from stopping at my stop which means i then have to wait another half an hour for a train and often i can't get on them because they are so busy or they are only 4 carriages. So that's an hour to wait.\n\nNearly every week i have to request a delay repay due to a cancelled or delayed train.\nThe seats in the train are often broken (even in 1st class where people are paying double!)\n\nJust really really bad service which is extortionately expensive!",

        "review_text": "I am writing to complain vigorously about the fact that for several years now, Greater Anglia continue to have absolutely disrupted train services from London to Norwich every single weekend. This is ridiculous. People end up having to drive because the train journeys at weekends are a. too lengthy and complicated, and b. ridiculously expensive. Greater Anglia make the journey difficult by taking two and half to three hours including changes, instead of the regular under two hours length direct and they charge \u00a355 for the privilege, when a normal advance is \u00a310. How can this be? This is outrageous and has gone on far too long. These engineering works were meant to have been completed months and months ago, if not years ago.I complained once before about two years ago and got a total whitewash response. I see now they have not done anything to sort it out. My friends and fellow passengers are very angry too. We all end up having to drive. With a climate crisis going on, this should be illegal for a train company to do this. Greater Anglia, when are you going to sort it out and put on normal train services at normal prices on weekends??Try IMMEDIATELY. And how about compensating us for the enormous additional fares in the meantime, and the additional car wear and tear from having to drive as we haven't got all day to meander about the country. Some of us have busy lives even if you don't. we can't just spend them meandering about from train to train for three hours, trying to get from a to b.",
