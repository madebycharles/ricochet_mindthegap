On average it takes about 20-30 mins to resolve at quiet times, at busy times who knows. I\u2019ve started going days before to sort it out as I know it\u2019s going to be appalling. In addition their app is terrible and never works. Can\u2019t believe this is still an issue in 2022, just go and buy your tickets from a machine directly and not via their website, it\u2019s quicker and 100x less stress.",

It's a Gatwick express ticket machine and the ticket options for the service are buried on page 2 after a bunch of unrelated commuter services. Most people using the machines are wanting gx tickets so put the most frequently purchased options on page one where they are quick to buy. One would almost think they are deliberately trying to mislead in order to confuse people into buying more expensive tickets. Also, 5 minutes before a train leaves, a staff member turns up to start emptying one of the two available machines. And there are only three tickets barriers, one is not working and the member of staff standing on the barrier is blocking one to guide people through the now one remaining barrier.

The Gatwick Express leaves 10 and 40 every hour and takes 31 minutes. This means 15 minutes average waiting time plus 31 minutes trip, in total 46 minutes on average for Gatwick Express. The standard Southern trains leaves 02 13 26 32 43 56 every hour and takes 32 minutes, except the 02 and 32 trains which takes 34 minutes.

When I then returned to Gatwick Airport from a weekend away I found that there were no trains running (I'd checked prior to travelling that trains scheduled and there was no planned maintenance work or strike and all looked good!). Ended up having to get a taxi back to Victoria. Called Gatwick Express regarding a refund (called a few times to get to the right person and spent a long time holding but did manage to speak to an actual person who could help! Great.) and they said \"no problem\", they then advised me as to how to go about claiming said refund.  After numerous attempts (via email) I was advised that I wasn't entitled to a refund due to purchasing a return ticket from Gatwick to Victoria and using the return part!  What?  How that happened I don't know and I wasn't able to use the Gatwick to Victoria bit as no trains were running so don't understand why the refund was not forthcoming!  Be aware of booking return tickets!  Look into booking singles and check the trains are definitely running first.  I spent a long time trying to sort this and believe I have not been fairly treated (especially after the numerous calls and emails, only at the very end of a long drawn out process was a refund denied).  Be careful!",

Secondly, the trains are very, very slow, often severely delayed (sometimes even cancelled for no specified reason) and are poorly serviced (dirty seats and toilets etc). Any delays or cancellations are, more often than not, not published on their website so the customer is not kept informed. I missed my flight recently because the Gatwick \"Express\" (what a joke!!!) was so delayed (and crawling along at such a slow speed for mile after mile) that I arrived late!! When I telephoned customer service they didn't even offer an apology and referred me to their \"Delay Repay\" service where customers can fill in a long winded form to apply for compensation in such circumstances (it also takes months for the compensation to come through)! It's important to note, however, that they do not take any responsibility for missed flights so the only compensation that can be awarded is a free Gatwick Express ticket!!! What an insult!! This service is a complete embarrassment to London and is nothing short of a national disgrace. If you want to travel to Gatwick Airport travel on Southern Rail instead - it's much cheaper, takes the same amount of time and is more reliable.",

If you communicate with them via e-mail, it takes up to 10 days to respond. You have to mail in a refund form. Then they e-mailed back saying they need copies of the tickets (that were sent to me via PDF in an e-mail). I forwarded via an e-mail, but that's not good enough. They said they can't print them and that I'd have to print them and send them via International Post. Really, they can't print them, but I have to print them then mail them to them??? Doesn't make any sense. Here's that they said:\n\nThank you for getting back in touch in regards to your ticket query.\n\nUnfortunately the tickets cannot be printed here, although you have forwarded them on as a PDF. You will need to print them and forward them on at your earliest convenience.\n\nWe require the original tickets to be sent to us for auditing purposes.

        "review_text": "Ordered our tickets (London Victoria - Gatwick return) at least three weeks prior to travel.  Tickets did not arrive! Phoned them 5 days before travel to ask them to cancel and resend tickets. Told this is not their policy! - ring again two days before travel!!!! This time got a more helpful man who cancelled our tickets (sending a cancellation form which included the postage.). He offered to send tickets to a machine but the whole point of us paying postage was to get the tickets in advance and not having the hassle of a machine so went to our local British Rail station and bought more tickets which were more costly.  Then I fumbled around on the internet for a refund form - not easy as there is a specific form if you fail to use tickets.  Finally found it and sent it off with the cancellation form the helpful guy had sent us.  Yes - you do wait 10 days for a reply!!! It said to send the unused tickets to an address in Asby de la Zouch!!!! WE DID NOT HAVE THE BLOODY TICKETS - THAT'S WHY WE WERE WANTING A REFUND!!!! AGAIN sent the cancellation form with an email saying I had  had just about as much as I could handle with Gatwick Express \"Customer Services\"!!! Another email back saying I would be hearing back in 10 days!!!  But no - it only took 3 days except ... they didn't refund me my postage, even though THEY lost my tickets, using an incomplete address to send them (the helpful guy had pointed out!!!)  That may sound petty but I paid that for a service they offered and didn't fulfil!\n\nThis is the group of dinosaurs who don't want guardless trains.  They also have a Customer services department which belongs in the dark ages!!! The sooner they sack the lot (except the helpful guy) and recruit some people who belong to the 21st century and use booking methods that aren't archaic (send tickets via the internet like every other travel organisation I know of) then they frankly deserve to go under.",
