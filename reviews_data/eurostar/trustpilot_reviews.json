        "review_text": "Das war mit abstand die schlechteste zugfahrt die ich je hatte(K\u00f6ln nach Paris). Erst hatte der Eurostar 45 Minuten versp\u00e4tung, dann musste der zug auf halber strecke(3 Stunden) um 0 uhr aufgrund von organisatorischen Problemen wieder zum n\u00e4chstgr\u00f6\u00dferen bahnhof fahren. Den Fahrg\u00e4sten wurde gesagt, weitere Informationen g\u00e4be es um 5 Uhr morgens. Genervt sind alle in umliegende Hotels gezogen und am n\u00e4chsten morgen wieder zum Bahnhof. Dort wurden uns zwar die Tickets f\u00fcr die weiterfahrt finanziert, jedoch war der Zug diesmal so \u00fcberf\u00fcllt, dass uns keine sitzpl\u00e4tze gegeben wurden. Ich kann nur empfehlen, die Fahrten mit Eurostar so gut es geht zu vermeiden.\n-ein gesch\u00e4digter Kunde",

One large enough to do significant damage if it was swallowed.\n\nTrain staff were great, apologised profusely and advised they would write an incident report.\n\nI complained formally to Eurostar who offered me a discount off a future ticket to restor my faith in the business (their words not mine). I refused this and now they have come back and said they have now passed the matter to their 3rd party caterers to resolve and I have to wait 6 weeks for a response.\n\nCome on Eurostar, you put the health and safety of your passengers at risk and then bat off the responsibility to a third party. My contract was with you, not your caterers. \n\nTake some responsibility, manage your suppliers failings and show the customer you actually care about them and own this disgrace.",

There is literally nothing that is ever settled in the clients favour, delays, rebookings, the recent points migration, or even conflict with client services around missed points due to the app. Key here is I don't understand  why the app as a cornerstone of the travel experience still misses points, but tells you to wait 24 hours before adding the travel reference, but also doesn't work so often over the past years. It really feels like its on purpose to clear statuses because the lounge was too busy. If they keep this up am pretty sure the lounge and the trains will be empty. ",

I was told there was nothing that could be done, extremely unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service, I gave them 6 days notice and they said it needed to be 7 and for me to try travel insurance. I even said I was okay with losing the hotel if they at least allowed me to move the travel day for the tickets to a month ahead, but with no success. Eurostar pocketed \u00a3470. ",

When we changed the tickets we were not notified that we aren't allowed to make anymore changes, usually you can change your tickets multiple times. We now not in a financial position to afford Disneyland and wanted to postpone our trip to next year. Eurostar however are refusing to change the ticket and saying that you will loose them. I'm really upset by this as we have tried to save to take our 5 year old to Disney. I feel that they were not helpful, were abrupt and not sympathetic to me and lacked compassion.

        "review_text": "We travelled from London to Amsterdam on a train and hotel package with business premier tickets. The facilities and service at St Pancras and on the train were excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed the first part of our journey. Unfortunately at Brussels there was a problem and after being held for ages we were told we couldn\u2019t continue for \u201coperational reasons\u201d and everyone was ordered off the train and just told to get the next one. There was no help or assistance. After several platform changes which are problem when you are travelling with a disabled person with mobility problems, the train arrived and everyone was told we were not allowed on and staff aggressively blocked anyone from getting on. They told us they couldn\u2019t help, we were on our own and we just had to go to the Eurostar desk. Obviously a train full of angry passengers meant it was chaos at the desk and no help anyway, we were told we had to arrange getting booked on another train ourselves. Instead of enjoying ourselves in Amsterdam we wasted hours of our holiday stuck in Brussels station. I understand problems can and do happen, but to not have a comprehensive recovery procedure, clearly communicated to both passengers and staff, with full support for passengers is completely unacceptable. Despite the train being initially being labelled as cancelled, when it comes to compensation they have now reclassified it as only delayed not cancelled. If abandoning a train full of passengers in an entirely different country to the one they paid to get to is not a cancellation, I don\u2019t know what is. On our return 5 days later we were held again at Brussels for over 3 hours. This time entirely beyond Eurostar\u2019s control and we got to stay on the train, but it was an anxious wait fearing history was repeating. I thought travelling by train would be less hassle than flying, it seems not.",

Water in de tunnel, eerst vertraging daarna cancelled. Wij in de stress hoe terug te komen, bellen Eurostar geen antwoord, appen geen antwoord, mmmh zelf retour uitzoeken. Geen hulp, niets niets niets. Zelf hotel en terugreis geregeld en betaald. Ze schrijven de dag erna dat je een claim in kunt dienen. Nou toen begon de ellende!! Kastje naar de muur. Ook een excuus ze worden samen gevoegd met Thalys Paris het kan wel duren. Terwijl ik een DJ op de radio hoor dat hij ook vast zat en binnen no time zijn geld terug had!!!! Ik heb na 4 maanden nog steeds mijn geld niet terug, ik kreeg een standaard bedrag terug voor mijn tickets, ik loop 360 euro mis. Wtf is dit voor oplichterij. ",

We weren't able to cancel our first hotel night as it was already 11 pm and the hotel couldn't rent the room toe anyone else. Except for rebooking our ticket free of charge (which is the bare minimum when your train is cancelled) we had no compensation for our three hour wait and for our hotel. When contacting customer service the only answer I get is \"sorry we can't reimburse those costs\" and no other explanation. We lost a lot of money and a lot of time. ",

We queued for an hour to get through only to be told that the train is delayed. It is delayed as they can\u2019t process people quickly enough.\nAgain at Gare du Nord there is nowhere to sit down as it so busy.\nWe will never use Eurostar again.

In a frenzy, we hastily booked a flight back to Bristol, only to receive an email moments later acknowledging their error \u2013 our train was never canceled. This gross incompetence cost us precious time, money, and ruined the remainder of our day in Paris. Despite eventually receiving a refund for the return fare, the damage was already done. Our trip was marred by unnecessary stress and uncertainty, leaving us deeply dissatisfied with Eurostar's reliability and customer care. Additionally, we were appalled to witness Eurostar's willingness to leave a disabled man in a wheelchair and his family stranded in Paris with no refund for at least 3 days, and no accommodation provided. Furthermore, their exorbitant charge of \u00a3150 more per person to change our train to the following hour was outrageous, especially when compared to the \u00a390 flight with EasyJet per person that we ultimately took. Eurostar's disregard for the well-being of its passengers and their families is unacceptable, and I cannot in good conscience recommend their services to anyone.",

Papierschilder ersetzen fehlende Schilder nur m\u00e4\u00dfig. \n\nDer Dutyfree-Shop im Abfertigungsbereich ist extrem weitl\u00e4ufig und schick. Die schummrige Wartehalle, in der die Fahrg\u00e4ste gestapelt werden, hat dagegen eher Kelleratmosph\u00e4re. Anzeigen, sofern \u00fcberhaupt vorhanden, sind kaum zu finden und nur in franz\u00f6sisch und niederl\u00e4ndisch, der Zug f\u00e4hrt aber nach London.\n\nVersp\u00e4tung \u00fcber 55 Minuten. Information, die ersten 15 Minuten keine. Der Mann am Info-Schalter antwortet auf die Frage, wie lange die Versp\u00e4tung voraussichtlich dauern wird, alle die im Wartebereich s\u00e4\u00dfen, w\u00fcrden warten. Das stimmt, beantwortet aber nicht die Frage. Laut Anzeigen im Wartebereich steht der Zug schon am Bahnsteig, Boarding und Einsteigen sind angeblich schon beendet, tats\u00e4chlich ist es noch gar nicht los gegangen\n\nAbfertigung. \u00dcber eine(!) Rollrampenanlage gelangen alle Passagiere auf einmal auf den Bahnsteig zum Zug., katastrophal schlecht organisiert und entsprechend langwierig. \n\nDas im Zug beworbene WLAN ist \u00fcberlastet, \u00fcber einen Gro\u00dfteil der Strecke ist kein Internet verf\u00fcgbar. WiFi funktioniert, wenn \u00fcberhaupt, allenfalls sporadisch in extremem Schneckentempo. Im Wartebereich ist eine Anmeldung wegen eines Serverfehlers erst gar nicht m\u00f6glich.\n\nF\u00fcr den schlechten Service und die schechte Organisation, sind die Tickets definitiv deutlich zu teuer.\n\nDass die Fahrg\u00e4ste schnell und komfortabel zum Zug kommen bzw.auf den Einstieg warten k\u00f6nnen, interessiert bei Eurostar offenbar niemanden, sie sollen allerdings ihr Geld im schicken Duty-Free ausgeben. Unternehmen, die an ihren Kunden interessiert sind, behandeln sie anders. Eurostar zeigt sich hingegen demonstrativ desinteressiert.\n\nFazit: Muss man sich nicht antun.",

The options were to leave a day earlier before the strikes started or stay an extra three days - not possible due to work and school.\nWe were able to change our tickets free of charge, and the hotel was great at refunding our missed night. Back in the UK though we were told that we had to pay extra to change our LNER tickets. They told us to contact Eurostar to seek compensation.\nEurostar were not in the slightest bit interested. The email I received from their \"customer service\" team stated our train hadn't been cancelled and that we'd chosen ourselves to cut our holiday short! What a bizarre thing to say. Anyway, I guess by this point they'd already got our money.\nWe're planning another trip to Disneyland later this year. We'll be flying.",

Eurostar has a lot of work to do to make customers welcome on their trains. They need to have proper customer training and escalation processes in place.

Ik haal nog net de trein naar Rotterdam, alwaar de Eurostar flink vertraagd is. Op Brussel Zuid na enorm rennen en veel stress, haal ik net de aansluiting, die meteen vertrekt. Vele anderen missen hem dus. \nJe betaalt een kapitaal en dit is wat je krijgt. \n\nVanwege ziekte moet ik eerder terug op 14 februari.

Here we sat on the train for a considerable amount of time before an announcement was made telling us a member of staff was missing,  then some time later we were asked to get off the train and wait on the adjoining platform for the next Eurostar to Amsterdam.  \nBefore the Eurostar arrived another announcement was made asking the hundreds of passengers to go to platform 16 and take the next train from there . It took ages for every one to get up the stairs and we hadn't even reached the next platform before a sea of passengers were coming back towards us telling us they were not allowed on because the train was full . So everyone went back to the Eurostar platform,  when the train arrived members of staff were barring the doors saying there wasn't any room .\nThis whole time there was not one member of Eurostar around to give anyone any advice or customer support . This is obviously a major stop on the London - Amsterdam route if this is where the staff change over happens so why isn't  there any customer service personnel stationed there ?\nEven an email with advice of how to get to Amsterdam would have been helpful but instead you just abandoned a whole train load of passengers on a platform  - such abysmal customer service.  We finally managed to make our own way to Amsterdam arriving 3.5 hours late ! \nSecondly - the sorry your train was delayed email . It wasn't delayed it was cancelled mid journey. \nThe options we were given for compensation were \nDelayed or Cancelled before journey started - neither of which was the case . Why is what I assume is a generic email sent out , Eurostar is a huge company surely an email could have been sent out that was appropriate to the situation,  again really poor Customer service. \nWe have been helped by a very nice young man called Martial who has said he can compensate us with an 80% of the outbound ticket price but personally I think the very minimum we should be offered considering the stress and inconvenience we were put through is a full refund. \nIt's a shame we were so looking forward to travelling on Eurostar and if we had been given information and support at Brussels although it would have not been the journey we were anticipating at least it wouldn't have been so stressful and we would have considered using Eurostar again but definitely wouldn't now \n",

I need to use my ticket for a separate trip and called to ask if I could get her ticket refunded or moved to my husband's name. They managed to change the name on the ticket to my husband's name and waived all the change fees!

        "review_text": "An absolute awful episode. This company can't be trusted and their services demonstrate a complete lack of customer care and contingency plans. On Friday January 19th on a train from Amsterdam Centraal towards London St Pancras, the train did simply stop half an hour away from Brussels Midi, the mid-stop for the entire journey. Despite being forced to stay stuck in Brussels, Eurostar kept hundreds of passengers for over 5 hours inside the carriages looking like \"headless chickens\" running around and trying to solve the problem. This clearly have shown that their trains lack maintenance for ages at this point and that they ignore training their staff to react to such faults. Despite all that, and with many young children and elderly inside, the only thing they could was feeding us with chocolate bars and water, which for instance they were running out from. The train stopped in Brussels past 3AM and after arriving at the terminal the communication with the ground security at the station was completely ignored causing tensions to rise amongst all. If European's green policies rely on thieves like Eurostar to reach their low carbon emission goals, so that's laughable and for that reason all of us will keep using airplanes, which are much cheaper and don't cause nearly half of the problems.",

        "review_text": "Voor het eerst met de eurostar naar Londen gegaan. Overweging: milieu; geen gedoe op een luchthaven; tijd in de trein kunnen werken.\n\nVooraf: ik had een ticket Amsterdam - Londen gekocht met het idee dat ik kort voor de reis zou kijken of ik in Amsterdam of Rotterdam zou instappen. Toen ik contact daarover had met 'James' van de klantenservice vertelde hij mij dat ik alleen in Amsterdam kon instappen en uitstappen. Op tussenstations, zoals Rotterdam zou niet mogen volgens het ticket. Daardoor moest ik veel vroeger van huis vetrekken, ook omdat omdat de Eurostar wegens werkzaamheden een omweg maakte via Haarlem, Leiden, etc. ipv de snelle route: dus eerst 1 uur 15 minuten hobbelen door NL. Op de terugweg bleek dat het geen enkel probleem is om in Rotterdam uit te stappen als je een kaartje hebt naar Amsterdam. Thanx James!\nInchecken in Amsterdam: zelfde procedure als vliegen: inchecken; security; NL-paspoortcontrole; Britse paspoortcontrole en daarna in een overvolle ruimte wachten tot je het perron weer op mag naar de trein.\n\nHeenweg: 2e klas: harde stoel, weinig beenruimte;\nTerugweg: 1e klas: dezelfde harde stoel; wel meer beenruimte; eten: ik had warm eten verwacht, (avondreis): was een eenvoudige koude hap: bieten met rodekool salade; bladerdeeg met kalkoen erin en zoet dingetje; wel fijn dat men een paar keer met drankjes/ koffie thee langskwam, ook een biertje of een wijntje (inbegrepen). Maar voor het eten hoef je geen eerste klas te boeken.\n\nWerken in de trein: nauwelijks kunnen werken: wifi werkte superslecht: langzaam en valt vaak weg dus schiet niet op.\n\nTotale reistijd van deur tot deur incl. incheckcircus: 7.5 uur. Beetje langzaam voor nog geen 500 kilometer. \n\nVolgende keer met de auto via de kanaaltunnel proberen of 's-nachts met Stenaline vanaf Hoek van Holland met de auto.",

Deze vertelde dat de reis al geweest was en ze niks voor ons konden betekenen...! Gelijk weer gemaild en gevraagd of er een compensatie voor werd geboden. 10 dagen later nog geen reactie!",

You take peoples money and don\u2019t refund us or offer us some sort of compensation for the situation you put me and my boyfriend through. Us and 16,000 others have also been effected on the weekend of new years but there\u2019s no excuse for leaving us in the dark and being told to wait 30 days!!! Honestly if I could leave no stars I would we arrived at the station about an hour and a bit before as stated to arrive at least an hour before to then get told 10 minutes after check in all trains are cancelled! Not only have we travelled over an hour to get to St Pancras we also very kindly got a lift from my dad who did a round trip journey so ended up driving for over two hours for no reason! Also as young travellers who have family\u2019s who also were affected and not being able to sleep due to the circumstances the early morning. I would like a proper apology and a date on when I\u2019m going to get my refund! Please book a flight instead of travelling with Eurostar it\u2019s much cheaper and more likely not to cancel last minute!",

We've just had to take a massive self-organized diversion, lost hundreds of pounds in making that work and had 24 hours of stress getting it sorted.\n\nOn the face of it eurostar should be the best option.\n\nThe biggest flaw is that eurostar will just cancel trains when trouble happens and (this is the bit that counts) they won't then run the train later.\n\nREAD THIS CAREFULLY: eurostar has NO meaningful spare capacity. They actually scrapped their spare trains. That means that you will have to find an alternative plan yourself. They literally have no plan to run trains late or add capacity. Monumentally stupid.\n\nAlready overseas? Stranded.\n\nOn the way to christmas? Tough luck.\n\nIt gets worse....\n\nTheir terminals at both ends are far too small and understaffed. We often turn up and after spending an hour at passport control we then end up standing in overcrowded departure lounges with limited toilets and seating. Not good if you are tired, have kids, unwell, etc.\n\nAnd as they have a monopoly, they can charge whatever they want.\n\nWe really need an alternative competitor and we also need a sensible way for the governments involved to regulate the eurotunnel and the terminals.",

Two days later she emailed new bookings with all of the family seated together AND then phoned to make sure we were all okay with the changes.  She did this on the St Pancras leg, the Lille leg and the return trip.\n\nBrilliant service from Hannah - take note Eurostar colleagues and Disney staff !  Hannah knows the meaning of customer service.  Thank you Hanna.",

Well we had a horrible experience on Dec. 21 returning to the UK from Paris.\nThe 11:00 train left the Gare du Nord ( I later read that no trains left after 10:30 due to the strike).  We got to the tunnel around 12:00 and the train stopped due to the strike.  We sat there for about 30 minutes then they announced that we were returning to Paris.  When we arrived at Gare du Nord there wasn't anyone to help passengers get to their destination.  Flights to London began to go quickly and we ended up spending $700 between taking the metro to Montparnasse, a train to Nantes, a taxi to the airport and a flight on EasyJet to\nGatwick ( the flight was delayed 4 hrs.).  We arrived at Gatwick at 4:00am.  It was the worst travel day!!!\nAll that Eurostar refunded us was $198 ( not half of the round trip fare).  They do not answer my inquiries and have not compensated us for anything else.\nAfter reading some of the reviews it sounds like they have no concern for their passengers.  I will never use them again.",

Je mag de trein niet uit en het enige wat we toen kregen was een Kitkat ter compensatie\u2026 Na die paar uur wachten werd er omgeroepen dat we terugrijden naar Brussel en dat er geen treinverkeer meer verder gaat naar Amsterdam\u2026 Door de machinist werd ook omgeroepen dat je of hotel verblijf kon regelen of taxi verder en dat dat volledig vergoed zou worden vanuit Eurostar\u2026 Wij hebben gekozen dus om met de taxi te gaan omdat we ook onze baby mee hebben en die was het al aardig zat en had ook niet meer genoeg voeding mee. Nu puntje bij paaltje, krijgen we niet eens de helft terug van onze taxi rit terwijl we ook nog een andere treinreiziger met ons hebben meegenomen\u2026 Ook kunnen we geen wachtcompensatie krijgen voor de 2,5 uur die we hebben stilgestaan in Mechelen\u2026 \nBelachelijk allemaal, wij zijn woest!!! \n",

I am \u00a3250 out of pocket from having to make alternative arrangements to get back to Edinburgh before Christmas, something they could not guarantee as the first available train after the strike was called, was the last one out of Paris on the 24th.  There was no connecting train to Edinburgh getting in before Christmas.  So they have offered me \u00a310 for subsistence, and won\u2019t even provide an email I need from my insurance company stating how long the delays were for those affected on the 21st.  Put this in public ownership like sensible countries do and let\u2019s have decent public oversight rather than obscene profits taking 1/4 billion from the system and providing appalling service when things go wrong",

        "review_text": "On my journey from London to Brussels, there was a one hour delay because there was a tresspaser on the tracks. They get us to leave the train to 'check the train's but let us back on after 20 minutes and no visible checks ... So on top of a delay, I spent my entire outbound journey feeling unsafe. On the day we were due to return to London, we find out on the news that the service is likely to be delayed/cancelled due to flooding. We received no push notifications on the app or any email or text communication regarding this information. Had we found out right away, we might have been able to book onto a train the next day (there was one train showing as available but the app would not allow us to book it). Our whole last day was spent panicking about how we would get home. We decided to the train station and were informed about the compensation for accomodation/meals/taxis, so once our train was formally cancelled, we rebooked a train for two days later (this was the earliest availabile train). We had to spend \u00a3500 for two extra days in Brussels, not to mention spending New Year's away from home and missed flight from London on New Year's Eve. I didn't even receive a confirmation email for my compensation/expenses claim. Yet my friend who tweeted Eurostar on Twitter received a response right away. They care more about protecting their image than refunding people who had to spend money unwillingly. Can I please get a response for an immediate refund of my expenses.",

        "review_text": "This was our first time travelling with Eurostar-so super excited. All went well till our return journey home. We get an email minutes before we arrived at the Paris Gare Du Noord station, to not come to the station as the trains been cancelled. We had already checked out off our hotel, it was the weekend before Xmas and we had family coming from South Africa on the 22nd Dec. Eurostar staff at the station said they could not help us as there were no alternate trains-they were fully booked for the next 3 days. We had to find alternative ways of getting back home to London (flight to Dublin then to Heathrow). Eventually got home on the 22nd Dec, meeting our family at Heathrow, absolutely shattered. Eurostar website and staff advised what they can reimburse us for. On the 2nd Jan '24 I put in my claims, received my case no. etc. Went back and forth with the Eurostar staff as their system is so old it was not accepting the receipt attachments. Eventually managed to email them across. Received a further email on the 30th Jan '24 that they have initiated our reimbursements and to allow 28 WORKING DAYS for it to reflect..which was going to be the 08th March '24. I rang them today, the 07th March '24, as I havent received it yet. Only to be told by Anamika that the reimbursement was rejected by their finance team. Apparently WE ABANDONED Eurostar by taking a flight home instead of waiting for Eurostar to find us a train journey home!! How furious I am!! Our travel insurance has been waiting for Eurostar to pay what they could and then the balance could be paid by the travel insurance. Anamika is to send me a letter today by 3pm stating that NOTHING is being paid by Eurostar so I can send this to our travel insurance. All I got was an apology. What else can you expect from a French Freakin' company! No wonder we left the EU! Do Not Use them!! Zero Stars!!",

        "review_text": "Slechte service! Wij hebben op de Eurostar website gekeken hoe onze zoon van 15 naar London kan reizen. Daarvoor moet je bepaalde formulieren invullen, handtekening zetten en een copy van je paspoort meegeven. Alles gedaan en de trip naar London ging helemaal soepel. Maar bij de terugreis werd ons zoontje verteld dat hij niet zonder begeleiding naar Nederland mocht terugreizen. Hij mocht mee naar Brussel en daar moest hij eruit. Hij had overigens een kaartje inclusief stoelreservering van London naar Rotterdam gekocht. \nIn Brussel is hij ook daadwerkelijk uit de trein gezet en kon hij daar 90 minuten wachten op de volgende trein die naar Rotterdam ging.\nWe hebben het zelf opgelost door ons zoontje zelf telefonisch te begeleiden naar een reguliere trein die binnen 20 minuten zou vertrekken naar Rotterdam. Dat is gelukt. Lange reis voor hem maar hij zat warm, droog en veilig in de trein. \nAan Eurostar hebben we niets gehad. Zijn niet telefonisch te bereiken en per e-mail kregen we het antwoord dat op de website staat dat jongeren onder 16 niet durect van en naar  Nederland en Engeland mag reizen. Dat staat inderdaad heeelemaal onder aan de site als een korte voetnoot. En uiteraard, nu we om een refund vragen voor het ticket omdat hij uit de trein gezet is (15 jaar en alleen h\u00e8) en hij dus geen gebruik heeft mogen maken van zijn stoel, is het antwoord ook \u2018Het stond op de website dus geen refund\u2019. Wat een waardeloze service! Wel het ticket verkopen en vervolgens een jochie van 15 op station Brussel eruit zetten! Echt zeer schandalig en onhumaan! Ja regels zijn regels maar er zijn ook omstandigheden die wellicht om wat flexibiliteit vragen! Nooit meer Eurostar!",

        "review_text": "Years ago, Eurostar used to be great: a reliable service for travel between Paris, Lille or Calais to London in style and comfort. But not now, not any more. They changed the rules about frequent traveller points expiry, without advising of new expiry date following the pandemic. Despite my email address being correct and registered as my preferred means of communication. When I booked a trip 1st time following the pandemic, 16 months ago, I saw that all my points had been deleted just a week earlier. Had they emailed me to warn of imminent points expiry as they should have, I could have saved my points. Customer Service refused point blank to admit fault, and refused point blank to reinstate lost points. Now there are fewer trains - which are more crowded - and intermediate stations of Calais Ashford and Ebbsfleet are now closed (I used to use Calais Frethun station regularly years ago back in the years when I was a \u201cCarte Blanche\u201d holder). When I last travelled with them in October 2022, I found the Gare du Nord was overcrowded, lack of staff, lack of facilities, on the train the standard of service in Standard Premier was \"nul\", no magazines, surly & unmotivated staff. Return journey: St Pancras horrendous long queue and wait for security & passport checks (Brexit?) waiting area overcrowded facilities reduced: couldn't buy newspapers or magazines & bar replaced with inferior snacks outlet. Impossible to find any staff. herded up the ramp to the platform like so many cattle. I have not travelled Eurostar since then (a year and 4 months ago) although I have visited the UK many times recently, travelling instead by driving and via the Shuttle. So that Eurostar has lost my custom mostly on account of refusing to admit their system at fault / failing to send automated emails and refusing to re-instate my lost points. My subsequent exchange with \"customer service\" merely enraged me further by their attitude and unwillingness to even look into the problem. I will never travel with them again. (Note \"Date of Experience\" was actually in October 2022)",

Their WORST issue is that they have 0 communication when things go wrong - my husband's train was cancelled due to the strikes on the 21st of December and mine was cancelled due to the flooding on the 30th; both times it was handled terribly by Eurostar with the website crashing as I tried to rebook and no way to to get in touch and not being told of the cancellation until we were heading out to the train (even though the news was reporting all trains were cancelled for the day, Eurostar claimed trains were still running on time).\n\nBoth my husband and I had to book last minute flights this holiday due to their incompetence which I HATE for the planet, but Eurostar really needs to get it together.",

        "review_text": "I did not enjoy my experience, Rotterdam to London! I arrived in more than 30 minutes before hand on another train. I went to the platform...it wasn't clear where to go so I stayed near the platform. I went to the WC which is outside the turn styles. Came back out about 19 minutes before the train time and the doors were shut. There was no line and the staff pointed me where to go to wait for the security line to reopen, but kindly told me they would do nothing to check me in...again no line, the train had not even arrived, but they refused to check me in. I had to watch my train arrive and leave while standing in an empty line 30 ft frome the train to go through their security checkpoint / customs. Maybe they all go on break after the 30 min before the train leaves threshold. \n\nThe excuse was that the security team leaves the train area!!! I had to wait 2 hours in the freezing cold because they refused to check me in. A smal amout of human compassion would have been wonderful. I could understand if there was a gigantic line, but no, it was empty. No concept of customer sevice! They did rebook me on the next train but I missed an important meeting with my boss. I don't know if it is a rule is rules thing or if they are just being difficult. \n\nThe experience was the opposite in London, people were working to get people through the long lines and someone even helped me with a ticket problem I had.\n\nI think I'll be taking the airport next time, and only using this at last resort.\n\n- A very cold and disatisfied customer.",

        "title": "ABSOLUTE CRIMINAL RIP OFF",
        "review_text": "Last Saturday we were travelling across France to get the 3.12 Eurostar from Paris to London. Our TGV was delayed over an hour and we weren't going to make it. I phoned Eurostar and was told only 8 seats available on the 5 and none on the 7 o'clock I was strongly advised to take 4 tickets at \u00a3 650!!!! as if Not they would go and we'd be stuck in Paris with 2 young children until the next day. She told me if I go to the stations Eurostar office they would charge me around \u00a3 50 each to go on the next available train which wouldn't be until the next day,  I was about to pay when I lost signal. I got through about 10 minutes later to be told only 5 seats available and now \u00a3 1050.00.  Again as no other option I was going to pay, lost signal again. We went to the Eurostar office at the Gard du Nord where we we're given 4 seats together on a table FOR FREE as there was plenty of seats available, I asked and yes plenty of space on the 7 o'clock also. On return to the UK I  phoned Eurostar and complained, was told someone would come straight back to me with an explanation, they didn't. I phoned the next day, explained again. Was told they would escalate and come back to me, they didn't. Phoned again, guaranteed someone would contact me within 72 hours. They didn't. I phoned again, not at any time did anyone I spoke to know what I was talking about, no one took any notes, no one had any intention of getting back to me. At every opportunity when I phoned from the TGV I was lied to and would have been ripped off, apparently according to the person I spoke to today none of the 3 staff knew about 'hotnat' where they should have transferred for free. However, the lad I spoke to earlier, after the event knew all about it in detail.. they had me at a disadvantage, took every opportunity to try and rip me off and when I complained had no intention of ever getting back to me. Have been told basically, oh well nothing we can do about that. rubbish.",

        "title": "Complaint Regarding Eurostar Travel Experience - Booking Reference 4F4D2Nr Customer Service,",
        "review_text": "Eurostar Customer Service,\n\nAs a frequent Eurostar traveller, I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the handling of my current journey on Eurostar, specifically regarding the trip from Bruxelles-Midi to London St Pancras, booked under the reference 4F4D2N.\n\nDespite my efforts to adhere to Eurostar's check-in time, which mandates closure of ticket gates 30 minutes prior to departure, myself, along with several other passengers, encountered an unforeseen delay originating from a situation on a connecting train from Antwerp. \n\nThis delay, attributed to an incident involving a man wielding a knife, necessitated the cancellation of the train.\n\nConsequently, we were redirected to an alternative train, which arrived at Bruxelles-Midi at 18:26. While this arrival time falls outside the prescribed check-in window, it is important to note that this delay was primarily due to Eurostar's own delay of 13 minutes. This delay shifted our arrival within the 30-minute check-in window, as per Eurostar's policy.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, it is disheartening and deeply frustrating that despite my efforts to comply with Eurostar's regulations, I was denied boarding at the ticket gates. This refusal, compounded by the absence of any queue at the security checkpoint and the emptiness of the station, highlights a lack of flexibility and understanding on Eurostar's part in accommodating passengers faced with unforeseen challenges.\n\nFurthermore, the option presented to us for rebooking our tickets, particularly the cost associated with upgrading to business class at 300 euros so we could still catch the train on time, only serves to my dissatisfaction with the overall handling of the situation. \n\nIt is unreasonable and unjustifiable to impose such penalties on passengers who have already endured significant inconvenience and distress.\n\nMoreover, the fact that I am now forced to wait for over two hours for the next train is nothing short of scandalous. \n\nThis additional delay further compounds the inconvenience I\u2019ve already experienced, demonstrating a disregard for customer well-being.\n\nIn light of the above, I urge Eurostar to reconsider its stance on this matter and to provide a fair and reasonable resolution. I demand a full refund of the original ticket price, as well as compensation for the distress caused by Eurostar's failure to provide adequate service. \n\nAdditionally, I strongly advise Eurostar to review and revise its policies and procedures to ensure that instances of gross negligence and disregard for customer well-being are not repeated in the future.\n\nI anticipate a prompt response to this complaint and expect Eurostar to take immediate action to rectify the situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\nFlorence Carlier",

        "title": "Amsterdam to London.......18 and a half hours",
        "review_text": "I am not really sure where or how to start but without question this was the worst experience I have ever encountered in both the travel industry but also in customer service.\nMy return journey from AMS to LON on 19 January was due to depart at 18.45 and arrive into LON @ 21.57.\nThe check-in at AMS is awful. Very cramped and uncomfortable with no express lane for Premier passengers. That was the least of my troubles....\n\nWe left on time and stopped in Rotterdam. We are now bound for Brussels and onwards to London via Lille. And this is where the horror began.\nAbout 10 miles outside of BRU we came to an abrupt stop. It was clear something was wrong but no information.......and so the saga began.\nEvery so often there was a very unclear, illogical announcement made by the Train Manager. The long and short of this.......the train had broken down and we had to be towed to BRU by a \"rescue locomotive.\"\nMembers of the Red Cross arrived on the train about an hour later and started handing out water......this was obviously quite serious. And so we sat in the cold with no power on the train. Toilets are now becoming very nasty and so the night pushed on....\nOk, lets try to make this brief.\nThe story goes on through the night and we finally get towed to BRU and arrive at 03.15!!!!! We have been on the train 8 and a half hours. We have been told to find a hotel if we can or sleep in the station!\nWhen we are finally allowed off the train into Brussels Midi we arrive in a waiting area which is sealed. We cannot leave the station. There is no information, no Eurostar representation.......a couple of pretty angry looking men in some sort of uniform. People are now getting very upset, shouting and children crying.\nAfter yet a further delay we are allowed into the arrivals are and basically go find yourself a hotel.\n\nSo I stayed at the Park Inn at Midi Station and finally reached my room at 04.20 due to the huge number of people who had booked the same hotel. While I was waiting to check in, I noticed 4 staff member from the train who were sitting in the lobby bar having a lovely time and a few glasses of wine.\n\n5 hours later I returned to the station in the hope of getting back to London. I am rebooked into Coach 2 seat 28. The train arrives late (no information of course that the train is delayed 25 minutes) and I go to my seat. I am travelling in Premier for a bit o f extra space and a light meal.\nOnce we had departed BRU the staff came along with the meal/ drinks trolley. The woman serving my area started asking if you wanted chicken or falafel. The man next to me took the chicken, then it is my turn. Having put the tray down in front me she looks again and says......\"you were on the train last night. What are you doing in this seat? You are not supposed to be on this train.......give me back the meal tray!\"\nI have NEVER been so shocked. She was aggressive, rude, openly hostile and a disgrace. She also wanted to take back the meal from the man next to me but he had already started eating. The 2 guys opposite had also been delayed overnight and she refused to serve them.\nI was told she was going to speak to the Train Manager about me! About what?? I was sitting in the seat on my new ticket..........but during the boarding process which was total chaos they changed the coach numbers around to try and keep today's clients separate from yesterday's stranded people.\nApparently we had all caused big problems by not listening to the announcements. I was in Coach 2.....but by some act of God it was no Coach 15!!! How do you know this and why???\n\nI will not bother to write more because if you are still reading you have probably fallen off your chair.\nToday's train was due into London at 11.57......we finally crawled in at 12.32.\nAmsterdam to London in a mere 18 and a half hours. \nOut of pocket for hotel and food.\nVerbally abused by a staff member.\n4 hours sleep in a hotel at Midi station BRU.\n\nThe situation was pretty dreadful but things go wrong when travelling. BUT Eurostar make a bad situation into a horror story. They simply do not care what happens to you and the \"duty of care\" does not exist to this company.\nThanks for reading!",

        "title": "Discrimination against a disabled person.",
        "review_text": "I am a disabled person who booked a ticket to Amsterdam six months prior. I called Eurostar 6 days before my departure to book the special assistance only to be informed that they only provide special assistance for the London leg of the journey and essentially informed me that I am on my own when I arrive at Amsterdam. I explained to the contact centre lady that it is physically impossible for me to walk the length of the platform she was unsympathetic and basically said there\u2019s nothing she could do to help me. Instead gave me the number for what I assume is Amsterdam\u2019s equivalent to National Rail and asked me to sort it myself. I had polio as a child therefore walking is extremely difficult for me and I have post polio syndrome too. So this means every time I walk I feel as though I am going to fall over and I do regularly fall over most days so walking is extremely difficult for me. I walk with a stick all the time but that doesn\u2019t stop me from falling and there\u2019s no trigger. My legs just gives way. Anyway I called the number she gave me but they were also unhelpful. So I tried Eurostar again two days later which is four days before my holiday. This time it was worse. I have never in my life been made to feel like a second class citizen because of my disability and for the first time in my life I was made to feel that way. After 1 hour and 35 mins on the phone and being put on hold several times I was told that there\u2019s nothing they can do because they do not offer disabled assistance in Netherlands. I explained to the lady that they are legally required to as a provider of public transport under the Equalities Act. Nowhere on their website did it say that they do not provide assistance in Netherlands and in fact I have screenshots of their special assistance page that implied that they did for all their routes. The lady then went on to make a judgement and insult me by saying can\u2019t I just use a wheelchair and wheel myself because she sees other disabled people do that. I was so upset by the comment I started to cry. I said how dare she make an assumption like that given that she knew nothing about the nature of my disability. It was the most insensitive thing anyone can say to a disabled person. She then went on to say I had two options. First is to use a foldable wheelchair and wheel myself despite the fact that I already told her it was impossible for me to do because I was travelling in my own with luggage. And the other was to cancel my trip however cos it is less than seven days before departure I will loose my money due to their cancellation policy. I then explained that obviously this is an exception given that I am having to cancel because of them and the fact that they cannot provide a legally required service thereby essentially discriminating against me. She tried to use some silly technicality by saying I should have specified assistance when I was booking the trip and i reminded her that I was never given that option. Plus I read the special assistance section like I always do for any trip I made and it stated that you provided assistance for all the routes, no where did this exclude Amsterdam. At this point I was too upset and was crying cos of the I lack of compassion or empathy from this lady. She said I should take it up with my insurance company if I want my money back or send an email to their complaints team who will get back to me in 28 days. Given that my holiday was in four days I said I refused to accept that because we both know it will be ignored. When I re-iterated how she has treated and insulted my disability she finally felt guilty and said she will raise a case and get someone to come back to me. Anyway she called me ten mins later and said given the situation they will offer me a voucher instead but cannot refund my money. I feel given the way they treated me and that they are breaking the law I expect a full refund because I do not even want to travel with a company that has no compassion for people with disabilities. I will be taking this further and will report Eurostar to the necessary authority body for this discriminatory treatment until I get my money back and an apology.",

I asked why but got no clear answer but was assured that we were all together and that it was just a change of carriage! Once on the train (despite being 50 mins late and with little to no food) this was not the case and we were seperated. Not a good end to our trip. I approached the train manager who agreed that this was not good and I was advised to contact Eurostar on our return for some form of refund and or explanation. Contacting is only via email and despite filling in the appropriate forms and chasing twice I have still had no response. Sloppy to say the least! Poor poor service....",

I've had to pay for three sets of return tickets in UK amounting to \u00a3150, which they will not reimburse me for. The night of 2nd December, we were held on the train for 2h30 then told that the train was no longer departing. We were told multiple times that they were going to reimburse me \u00a3300 per night for a hotel room. As it was 22:00 and there were UK rail strikes going on, I stayed at a nearby hotel. Now, I am being told that they will not pay me back ANYTHING, costs that they have caused me to incur. This company and their lying staff is to be avoided at all costs - crooks pretending to run a reputable business. Merry Christmas to me being \u00a3450 + cost of my ticket out of pocket.

        "review_text": "I purchased tickets to travel from Paris to London during December 2021, unfortunately Omicron happened and the UK shut down. I called and messaged Eurostar to get a refund, under obvious circumstances you'd expect to receive relief since I was literally unable to enter the country, Eurostar was a complete disappointment. Never in my life had to deal with a company so irrational and inflexible. I was told my ticket was non-refundable nor transferable from the get go and my only option was to keep pushing out the travel dates to avoid losing my money. I live in the US, chances I will come back to do the exact same route are minimal, but I continued changing dates for almost two years! until November 2023 when Eurostar started trying to charge to update my trip. Called customer service again to get new dates without having to put more money on the tickets, I received no help whatsoever, ended up missing the train and losing my money. This is by far the most unaccommodating company. Covid was a painful experience which should have created conscious to be more understanding. I do not recommend traveling with Eurostar, most insensitive and obstinate customer service EVER.",

        "review_text": "I am writing to express my deep distress and disappointment with a recent experience I had with Eurostar, which has left me in a state of emotional and financial hardship.\n\n1.  On 24 Nov I had one day trip from London to Brussels at 6.16 am and back from Brussels to London at 3.56 pm. I had traveled for a job interview and was scheduled to return to London the same day. This trip was critically timed due to my responsibilities as a breastfeeding mother. I had left a sufficient amount of milk for my newborn but needed to return promptly to continue breastfeeding, as the absence of regular feeding/pumping was causing physical discomfort and pain for me and baby. \n\n2. I arrived at the station at 3:30 PM for a 3:56 PM train from London to Brussels. I was unaware of the policy that gates close 30 minutes before departure, as this was not prominently displayed or communicated ( as it\u2019s for example on airplane boarding passes) . As a result, I missed the cutoff by a mere four minutes. I was not allowed to board my scheduled train back to London, as I arrived at the station four minutes after the gate closure time. The necessity to return to London promptly was not just a matter of convenience but a critical health issue for both me and my baby. Delaying my return could lead to complications with breastfeeding, which I had been managing through a strict schedule throughout the day. This was the only option given to me to ensure I could return home in time to care for my newborn, who was being looked after by a kind individual for the day and had HARD STOP and other commitment at 5.30 pm \n\n3 Upon realizing  mistake, I pleaded with the staff, explaining my circumstances - a breastfeeding mother, a refugee from Ukraine alone with newborn , I don\u2019t have any help here, a job seeker, and a wife to a husband at war very much need take EXACTLY THIS train. Despite my distress and the minimal delay, I was denied empathy and flexibility at all, manager was rude, saying that it\u2019s my problem and I\u2019m bad mother if I didn\u2019t have plan B, it\u2019s not her problem, and \u201cexploiting my position\u201d. She told she would only allow me to get the train if I will buy new Business ticket for the same train , which is 3X times expensive.  waiting for another two hours was not feasible due to my breastfeeding schedule. I didn\u2019t have choice but to buy this expensive ticket to take a train I already had a ticket \n\n4. This incident has not only caused me significant financial strain but also emotional turmoil. I was forced to spend money that my family cannot spare, and the entire journey back was spent in tears, I didn\u2019t touch food, feeling humiliated and frustrated.\n\n I understand the necessity of rules and policies, but I firmly believe that there should be room for compassion and understanding, especially under exceptional circumstances like mine.",

Eurostar told us to pay for a hotel overnight and sustenance...and on returning agreed the amount...we were compensated for the loss of travel...but we are still waiting for reimbursement. \n\nAfter several emails, two phone calls and an unanswered complaint to Customer Services, I can see a definite script playing out. It's easy for them to say 'Get a hotel; Eurostar will pay' when they know how difficult it is to get reimbursement. Looks like my next step will be the Small Claims Court.\n\n[After chasing several times Eurostar paid me (\u00a30.56 less than the amount), however, it was not within the agreed 28 days, and they never replied to my online complaint (does this just go into a bin somewhere?). The whole experience feels like customer contempt.]",

If you get a response eventually it\u2019s unhelpful and dismissive. \nThere is an error in my account, I cannot collect points, the system is not recognising my club membership. I am not getting response from customer service. \nMy daughter had her train cancelled - no one bothered to inform her.\nOn another occasion - My daughter was advised to forfeit her journey and claim on insurance as the system won\u2019t let her change outward journey date to after return. She had to change both journeys and rebook the original return.\nAnother situation - My email was ingnored. Eventually I had to write and post a letter to claim compensation for lack of provision of premier standard meal. Not only was the food not served but they ran out of water. Months later got a voucher for a few quid. Waste of time. \nIt\u2019s a great shame. I love train travel but this is not working. Eurostar - get yourself sorted!",

        "review_text": "Afgelopen week voor veel geld een eersteklas kaartje gekocht naar Parijs vanaf Schiphol. Tot Schiphol ging de reis redelijk (NS) op Schiphol aangekomen is de Eurostar trein gecanceld, bij de info balie zeggen ze er gaan geen treinen van Eurostar meer vanaf Schiphol u moet naar Amsterdam centraal, Met een tekst \u2018 dan heeft u alleen geen reservering meer\u2019 . Aldaar (eindelijk) aangekomen wilde de Eurostar trein manager(een absolute hork overigens) mij niet meenemen en moest ik de volgende trein proberen. Weer een trein later opnieuw geprobeerd te boarden en dat lukte, geen eigen stoel reservering dus gewoon even ergens gaan zitten. Dat ging goed tot Antwerpen, nu ben ik in Brussel en heb weer een andere stoel moeten zoeken. Is gelukkig wel gelukt. Mijn gevoel voor onrecht, ik heb veel geld betaald voor een eigen stoel, zorgt voor irritatie en boosheid richting Eurostar. Ondertussen heeft ook deze trein al meer dan 50 minuten vertraging en krijg ik steeds berichten op mijn e-mail dat mijn oorspronkelijke trein, die dus gecanceld was \ud83d\ude33, met vertraging zal aankomen op Paris gare du nord\u2026.\nBijzonder teleurstellend deze gang van zake",

        "review_text": "I am not sure this is an entirely Eurostar matter but I was travelling with them so I think the responsibility falls mainly to them.  With great fanfare, it was announced recently that Thalys has merged with Eurostar, so now the old Thalys route from Amsterdam to Paris is a Eurostar route.  \n\nToday I was booked on the 12.11 Eurostar from Amsterdam and on getting to the station I discovered it was cancelled.  (I probably did not get personal notification because it was booked for me, for a conference).  The international ticketing office at Amsterdam put me on the next Eurostar at 13.11 but with no booked seats.  They said I should ask the train manager to find me a seat.\n\nThe platform for the Brussels/Paris train is shared with the \"real\" Eurostar going to London.  I spoke to a member of staff working there and she said she worked for Blue Eurostar not Red Eurostar (Thalys) and that when the train arrives I should look for the train manager.  There were no Red Eurostar members of staff on the station platform at all.  It seems clear that the two Eurostar services still operate fairly independently of each other.\n\nMy train arrived and no train manager appeared.  I went back to Blue Eurostar lady but she said I should just look further down the platform.  There was no-one.  In desperation I got on the train and just sat anywhere, feeling very stressed.  The train manager was walking through and I explained the situation.  She said the train was full and there were no seats available - I and many other people had been booked on to a Eurostar that was already full. \n\nShe said I could sit in any empty seat until passengers claimed them at Schiphol Airport but it was very stressful and after having to move twice, I spent the rest of the journey on a jumpseat between carriages where at least I would not have to move.\n\nTo be fair, it wasn't the fault of Eurostar that a lot of displaced passengers were put on a full train (although presumably they having cancelled a train must have realised we would need to be put somewhere).  It is the fault of Eurostar/Thalys that no staff were available at all to advise us or make the process more human and dignified.  It is the fault of Eurostar that they trumpet this new merger which isn't really a merger at all as the \"Blue Eurostar\" staff don't know what is going on with \"Red Eurostar\" (the lady I spoke to at Amsterdam said I'd been given wrong information about where the train was arriving - but in fact she was the one with the wrong information). \n\nJust a really poor show all round.",

        "title": "My worst international train experience ever",
        "review_text": "I\u2019ve been internationally travelling by train for 40 years now, but my recent trip from the Netherlands to London and back with Eurostar was the most unpleasant and at the same time most expensive travelling experience ever. \n\nWe had booked our tickets with Dutch railways (NS). As usual, we got travel advice together with our tickets. Even though we had taken one train earlier than stated on the tickets by Dutch railways, our international train connection from Breda to Brussels Midi arrived 15minutes late - but still 30 minutes before the departure of the Eurostar to London. We all rushed to the terminal of Eurostar, which was badly signed and hard to find.\n\nInternational trains used to wait in case of delay of important international connections, and the only train from The Netherlands to Eurostar seems to be an important connection to me. I therefore would have expected that we could still board. The terminal was completely empty, security checks would only have costed minutes.\n\nYet we were told in a very unpolite way that we were late and therefore couldn\u2019t board. That the only International connection from The Netherlands had been late and that we followed the exact travel advice that NS had given us, didn\u2019t matter to the staff.\n\nImagine, you\u2019re just 4 minutes late for boarding together with approx. 20 other people (and not because of your fault), the terminal is empty and the controls would take just few minutes AND your train departs in 26 minutes, yet you\u2019re being treated as if you needed some punishment - while you did what you could and had been told (and payed \u20ac 300 per person for 2nd class tickets on a relatively short distance).\n\nThe passengers who arrived with that Dutch train got replacement tickets for the Eurostar 2 hours later while their booked train was still standing on the platform! \n\nNo apologies or even an explanation or whatsoever why we couldn\u2019t board. \n\nOne lady got frustrated and ventilated her anger, but not in an aggressive way and without shouting or whatsoever. She\u2019s been told that she couldn\u2019t board even though she travelled with children. It was evident that she was no threat, just stressed and frustrated - we all were. Nobody dared to say anything anymore. It was tense.\n\nAll the passengers arriving with that train from The Netherlands got replacements tickets for the next Eurostar - 2 hours later. \n\nThe waiting room in Brussels was outdated, depressing and filthy, as were the toilets.\n\nThe train itself had a more luxurious feel than \u201cnormal\u201d trains and staff was much friendlier and service-oriented than the station staff. The train trip itself went smooth, nothing scaring about the tunnel, only the rattling noises outside at high velocity sounded a bit worrying.\n\nI have to admit: it was lovely to arrive in the centre of London and to be able to directly use London\u2019s tube system and arrive in London\u2019s city centre within minutes by tube (or bus)!\n\nFor our return trip from London, we had to be at London St. Pancras 60-90 minutes before departure. Again, there was a very unfriendly atmosphere. Station staff was yelling, it difficult to understand their yelled instructions and staff was evidently under high tension. The handling of hundreds of passengers extremely chaotic and I doubt the quality of safety controls is anywhere near the one at airports. Passport check was also extremely chaotic, with unmotivated and grumpy staff.\nThe waiting room was way too small for the massive amount of international passengers to Paris and Brussels, several hundreds of persons (one Eurostar London - Brussels alone has a capacity of 900 persons) had to stand with heavy luggage in a very crowded space with no crowd control in place. Elderly people and parents with children stood around for an hour, some sat on the ground. There were no gates or dedicated areas. I doubt you could evacuate so many people with so much heavy luggage standing around from such a crowded space.\n\nOn our trip from London to Brussels the space between chairs was so cramped that we (1,79-1,83 cm) couldn\u2019t sit upright with both feet parallel on the ground which caused back- and hip pain and made it quite uncomfortable. \n\nTo sum it up:\nWe wish Eurostar would make safety and customer experience/ service more of a priority. We wish they would train, motivate and supervise their station staff better. \n\nThe huge amount of bad experiences shared here show that unfortunately, we aren\u2019t the only ones with disappointing experiences.\n\nWhich is a pity, since travelling by train is not only the more sustainable option to travel to London, but potentially also the most relaxed one.",

My connecting train in the UK was cancelled so I needed to move to an earlier train or not get home. I tried to move to the train an hour before, which had seats free, and was charged \u00a390 to move to a standard seat. So I was taking a seat that would otherwise be empty, on the same route, 1 hour earlier and in a lower class ticket, and had to pay \u00a390. \nI emailed customer services saying I was disappointed and this felt like punishing customers for being early and got a sarcastic response and no further action. \nHave since read the exchange policy and they actually overcharged me according to that and have ignored my email asking for a refund of the difference. \nReally disappointing - we need good and affordable trains more and more instead of planes. Instead we have these rip off merchants.",

Efficient, good service, classy!\nNow it's basically Megabus/ Ryanair,  with even worse customer service. \nMy boring story:\nTried to reschedule return journey 3 days before returning.\nUnbeknown to me, the website was being updated. \nSome system error led to a fault with the drop down date menu, making it IMPOSSIBLE to select new return dates. The dates were all grey, as though unavailable, despite there being plenty of tickets available online.\nI was staying in rural France with no mobile reception. I had to travel to the nearest town to sit on the phone in a queue until gone 6. Repeating this the next day.\nThe last few days of my trip were ruined trying to resolve this  \nBy the time I did get through, the ticket prices had more than tripled. Meaning it would have been cheaper if I had just booked entirely new tickets 3 days prior.\nThe customer service lady, 'Ria' denied that this was the case?!!! Saying they could not have been cheaper 3 days ago \ud83d\ude24 and it was 'my word against theirs' without proof? Oh yeah, the proof that every single regular Eurostar traveller knows, the prices hike massively in the days before departure!! \nSo there's the difference in price (hundreds) then the smarmy \u00a330 change of ticket cost (\u00a330? Each? Why?) and not one single apology. Customer service simple continue this weird loop of repeating the accusation that I am either unable to use a website or a phone?\nNot once have they acknowledged their broken website??\nEvery decent company who has migrated a website has a procedure in place for the inevitable glitches! It goes without saying that large website are very difficult to migrate, but do it with transparency. Why not admit the issue and at least waiver the \u00a330 fee, offer an upgrade or do as I asked and sell me tickets at the price I would have paid IF I was able to book the b****y tickets!! Why should I be financially penalised for their error?\nWell, I'll tell you why- they know what they are doing, they are sharks and the recent incarnation is running what was an amazing service to the ground.\nYou can prove to be a good company and STILL make profit.\nIf I liked Eurostar like I did in the past I'd use it all the time! But, like most people here, I end up flying and use Eurostar sparingly.\nWhy pay more for this c**p?\nAND, after all their hard work making a new site, it's awful? Not to mention the rebranding??? UGGG! Who the hell is in charge of this shambles???\nShame on the lot of you\n(And for hiring untrained kids that's can't spell to be in charge of email complaints).",

        "title": "Angenehme Reise von London nach Amsterdam",
        "review_text": "Gefahren sind wir mit dem Eurostar am Freitag, 15. September, von London nach Amsterdam. F\u00fcr zwei Personen haben wir lediglich zusammen 170 Euro bezahlt. Jedoch haben wir das Ticket auch schon fast 6 Monate vorher gebucht, die Abfahrzeit war mit 8.16 Uhr zudem sehr fr\u00fch. Doch schon 2 Stunden sp\u00e4ter w\u00e4re der Zug an diesem Tage wesentlich teurer gewesen. So ist die sch\u00f6ne neue Welt mit dem \"dynamic prizing\".\nPositiv: Wir sind p\u00fcnktlich in Amsterdam angekommen. Und das ist man ja bekanntlich in Deutschland von der DB nicht gew\u00f6hnt.\nEin dicker Minuspunkt beim Eurostar sind die beengten Verh\u00e4ltnisse im Bahnhof St. Pancras International. Der Warteraum ist, bezogen auf die vielen Fahrg\u00e4ste, viel zu klein, die Zahl der Sitzm\u00f6glichkeiten beschr\u00e4nkt. Es herrscht ein ziemliches Gedr\u00e4nge. Da eine Viertelstunde zuvor auch noch ein Eurostar nach Paris fuhr, war es schon sehr eng. Zumal die meisten Reisenden auch gr\u00f6\u00dferes Gep\u00e4ck dabei hatten. Ich wage mir gar nicht auszumalen, was in den Ferienzeiten los ist. Menschen mit Handicaps sind hier wahrscheinlich schnell \u00fcberfordert.\nDie Fahrg\u00e4ste konnten auch nicht auf den Bahnsteig gehen. Der Bahnsteig wird erst kurzfristig bekannt gegeben, und dann \u00f6ffnen sich auch erst die T\u00fcren.\nEmpfohlen wird, zumindest 45 bis 60 Minuten vor Abfahrt des Zuges vor Ort zu sein. An diese Empfehlung sollte man sich halten, denn man passiert zwei Grenzkontrollen. Das aber geht alles sehr z\u00fcgig und professionell, auch unter Einsatz moderner Technik.\nIm Preis inbegriffen sind Sitzplatzreservierungen. Er war eine bequemer Fahrt, und es gab gen\u00fcgend Platz, um die Koffer zu verstauen. Ein bisschen nervig war der Videobildschirm, auf dem die Zielanzeige \"Amsterdam\" st\u00e4ndig flackerte.\nZu beachten ist: Auf dem Ticket und auch bei der Buchung werden alle Zeiten in \"local time\" angegeben. So fuhren wir in London um 8.16 a.m. los, erreichten Amsterdam ca. 13.15 Uhr - und waren doch nur 4 Stunden unterwegs.\nDer Eurostar ist auf jeden Fall eine gute Alternative zum Flugzeug. Und wer sehr zeitig bucht, morgens fr\u00fch losf\u00e4hrt, m\u00f6glichst noch auf die Tage Dienstag, Mittwoch und Donnerstag ausweicht, der kann ein Ticket f\u00fchlbar unter 100 Euro buchen.\nDazu kommt noch: Man muss in London nicht einen langen Weg zu irgendeinem Flughafen in Kauf nehmen, sondern aus fast allen Stadtteilen kann man mit maximal einmal umsteigen mit der U-Bahn zum Bahnhof fahren. In nur gut f\u00fcnf Minuten l\u00e4uft man von der U-Bahn-Stadion King`s Cross St. Pancras innerhalb des Geb\u00e4udes zum Eurostar-Bahnhof.\nAlso wir w\u00fcrden wieder mit dem Eurostar fahren. Der Preis ist okay, und es ist \u00f6kologisch vern\u00fcnftig. Und wenn ich meinen Weg von Haust\u00fcr zu Haust\u00fcr genau kalkuliere: Ich bin auch schneller als mit dem Flugzeug.",

We had to run in order to catch the train. This is unacceptable.

        "review_text": "Trying to book a trip with Eurostar is quite an undertaking. The differentiated pricing (more expensive after the morning rush, more expensive on week-ends, etc.) adds up to the experience. Worse to come: when trying to pay, the card was refused for an untold reason. So be it, let us try another card. Same reaction. Again with other cards, a card with another person in the travelling group, etc.: still same refusal, the message hinting that it must be the fault of the payment card provider... or providerzzzz for that matter. When trying to solve the mystery with the chat, the bot could only find the usual artificially stupid responses. To access some form of human support, the not-yet customer is supposed to pay a fee! Our sense of dark humour has stopped there. Never again Eurostar. Please Eurostar, learn about the basics of selling, for a start. And ask me never to call you a star again.",

        "review_text": "Arriving from Amsterdam to get a connecting train to St. Pancras, I arrived five minutes late after the gate closed as I'm disabled and needed the toilet.  Unfortunately, the staff at Brussels wouldn't let me through, but they did get me on the next available train home.  There were 17 minutes between arriving in Brussels and getting to the boarding gate.  I had to get help with my bag to get off the train, find the lift, wait for the lift, and go to the toilet.  I then had to find the boarding gate.  I can't walk very fast as I have a walking stick to support the severe ankle arthritis I suffer from.  \n\nI was annoyed because I would arrive home 2 hours later than planned. I contacted customer service and spoke to Callum, who was very caring and helpful.\n\nEven though I arrived late, the staff were fantastic in Brussels.  A chap helped me with my bag to board the train, and one gentleman understood my situation and was very kind.\n\nMy advice is, if you're disabled, get a later connecting train.  It's too stressful to be expected to locate the lift and find the Eurostar boarding gate in Brussels in less than 20 minutes.  Even If I hadn't gone to the toilet, I would have only just made it within the 30-minute timeframe by the skin of my teeth.",

        "title": "Terrible customer service and unorganised",
        "review_text": "Took the Eurostar for the first with my family from London to Paris. The journey in the train was well and smooth. It was comfortable. However, what made the journey stressful and annoying was encountering the staff because of their terrible customer service. The staffs from London, UK side were rude! Straight up rude. Because it was my first time, I wanted to ask questions\u2026 I\u2019ve asked a question but the response was unhelpful and seemed like the staff didn\u2019t want to help. So i stopped asking and asked a passenger instead who was a lot more helpful. When we got to the security checks for our luggage, we had a minor inconvenience (we accidentally left one tiny suitcase near the scan lol which was kind of our fault haha) - so I asked the staff if I could get it back - but the staff\u2019s response to me was insulting! The staff said \u201cso why did u leave it then?\u201d - tbh it was accidental to leave it and didn\u2019t mean to leave it and I\u2019ve asked politely. Either way, I didn\u2019t deserve that kind of sass and he should of responded to me in a professional manner. (We managed to get out suitcase back). Overall, the staff are unhelpful and rude to the fact that you as the passenger is too scared to ask them anything, which in my opinion is not right. Them as the staff should be ready to answer any questions in a polite and professional manner and make sure that the passenger feels fine in a stressful environment.\n\nOn the way back home (so from Paris to London) -\nThe French Eurostar security part was fine, it went smoothly and the staff was a lot more nicer! I\u2019ve asked questions and they\u2019ve answered in a calm professional manner (in a very busy stressful environment). The only down side was that, it was very unorganised! They had signs in the screen and I would follow it, but then turns out the signs are useless because the staff changed the lines. So you\u2019d think you\u2019re lining up to the right queue because the train time is shown on it, but turns out it\u2019s not lol (no idea if that made sense). So there were a lot of people confused and constantly on the wrong queue.\n\nI had big hopes for Eurostar and had big expectations\u2026 I was very disappointed with what I had experience with the staffs and how unorganised it was. However, I\u2019d like to try Eurostar again to see if my first experience was just a flop and to see if it was just a bad day for everyone. But if I experience it again, then I\u2019ll stick to flying.",

We were told we would be given compensation if we contacted Eurostar once home. However on our return I have been informed that apparently I'm lying and this never happened, so no compensation has been given. We travelled in August on a very hot day so comfort was 100% compromised. They also were not able to provide a meat option on the way back to London which I think is rediculous given you pay so much for the ticket. We also arrived 25 min late on the way home which meant we had to run with 4 suitcases to get our connecting train. Worst customer service I've experienced in a long time.",

They are extremely uncooperative and do not care at all about an hour difference of being outside of their \u201cseven day period\u201d for cancellations. We even had insurance, to which the claim couldn\u2019t be made and was said to take 6-8 weeks anyway. Something that could have been cancelled in minutes ended up with us at a loss of $992 and a trip we couldn\u2019t even make. Very unhelpful. Zero customer service consideration.

I'm 6'5\" and my legs are currently splayed around the seat in front of me, they won't fit behind it.\nI suppose the train itself was foreshadowed by the waiting room at St. Pancras, where they tell yo to arrive 90 min before your departure, then provide seating for only about half the travellers as you wait a full hour in the lounge prior to boarding.\nThe final insult, the announcement as you depart about how they are concerned for your comfort.\nIf this is the best of Anglo-French engineering, I'll count my blessings if I arrive alive.",

We randomly stopped for almost 3 hours tripling the time it took me to get to London.\n\nFor the inconvenience we were supposed to get refunds on our tickets if we submitted a request on their site. Not at all surprisingly, when me and my family tried to submit a request, it didn't work. We tried a few times and another few times another day and it never worked. \n\nSo then we decided to send a message to their customer service. There was plenty of time to get a refund, a whole 28 days, so surely we would be able to work this out with the customer service before then, right? WRONG! It has been 2 months now and we have yet to hear back from them. I'm not sure they'd give us a refund anymore even if they did message us back.\n\nTL;DR Eurostar is a terrible way to get to or from the UK and you should stay away if possible.",

        "review_text": "I booked a two way trip through the app of Eurostar from Amsterdam to London and I was supposed to get on the thalys train to Belgium to then hop on the Eurostar train from Belgium to London. \nThen I got an e-mail from the thalys conpany saying that during a period of time most of their trains were cancelled due to maintenance service so I had to re-book the whole trip from Amsterdam to London as there was no other connection available. In their e-mail they told me it was cost-free. However I had to pay the full amount of \u20ac280 euro since it was very short notice and it is very difficult to get in contact with the customer service from either Eurostar or Thalys about this issue. \nI had to re-book the trip and pay the jackpot amount for a trip that I originally already payed for. \n\nAfterwards I tried to contact Eurostar and Thalys about this and they both referred me to the other party clearly not going to help me out. As a customer I felt really betrayed by both of these companies because they seem to not care about their customers at all. After a while I decided to give it another try. I send Eurostar a very detailed e-mail explaining the whole situation also mentioning that in the message from Thalys they told me it was going to be cost-free to reschedule that trip. \n\nIt took 5 weeks to reply and the only message I got was an automated message saying: \"Thanks for contacting us in regards of our services. We hope your questions got answered and the problem is solved. This case will be closed but if you require further assistance do not hesitate to contact us again.\" \n\nThey have not solved ANYTHING they are simply ignoring me and they put an automated system in place to just make me shut up. I am still very angry about this because in the end it is not my fault that the thalys train was cancelled for a trip I already payed for. \n\nThere is literally no help from any customer support and now I feel afraid every single time I book a trip from Eurostar that the very same thing will happen again. \n\nThey do not care a slightest bit.",

However, I checked my account and what a surprise to see that my point have not been added to my Club Eurostar Points that could allow me to get free return tickets or other perks. \nI called Eurostar's customer service this morning and had the most inconsiderate person on the phone. I was explaining calmly that this is not fair because points should have been added \"automatically\" and what has been answered to me is that \"you have to take responsibility over your Club Eurostar membership and connect once in a while to see if points have been added or not\". For an \"automatic process\", this is quite a joke and I was expecting far better given the usual great service we have at the station and in the train. Also, as a recurring traveller, I am choosing Eurostar for ecological reasons but I will now consider taking the plane more often.",

        "review_text": "So I was on the 9106 from London to Amsterdam on the 5th July. Due to issues outside of Eurostars control (Storm in Netherlands) my train terminated in Brussels.\n \n I opted to stay the night in Brussels and continue my journey on the first Eurostar train from Brussels in the morning (This was the 9106 9.13am train). This part of the issue appears to have been resolved. Advised they have refunded the hotel (still not received it but accept it will take 28 days).\n \nI spoke to numerous Eurostar employees who generally were amazing and supportive. I was told to speak to the train manager on the platform and on asking a number of Eurostar employees I was pointed to someone that said she was the train manager, she had a radio and badge stating this.\nShe advised as I was in standard Premier that I go to the front of the train.\nI walked to the front and waited for the train to arrive. Anita (spelling?) then approached me as the train arrived saying \u2018you stood there and didn\u2019t speak to me I am the train manager and I say who gets on this train\u2019. I tried to explain to Anita that I had thought I had spoken to the manager but she did not listen l, she was rude aggressive and stated numerous times she was the manager and there\u2019s no other managers. She saw me get on the train in carriage 16.\nWhen the tain left Anita came up to me and was very argumentative from the start she was incredibly rude and would not allow me to explain to her that I was told to speak to the train manager which I did she then proceeded to say she was the only manager on the train. Said to me as my original ticket was coach 14 (still standard premier it was actually coach 1) that I had to move all my luggage to this coach even though there were lots of free seats in the standard premier carriage I was in. I tried to discuss with her that would it be ok to stay where I am. She spoke over me stated I was rude and that she says what happens.\nShe continued saying how rude I was even looking at other passengers saying he\u2019s so rude. She then left. \nLater in the journey another train manager did an announcement to say she along with Anita were the train managers. Anita said she was the only manager?\n \nAbout 1 hour into the journey Anita came back to me asked for my ticket and said your ticket is coach 1 there is no issue. \nAnita then continued to be very rude not listening to me and again making it clear to other passengers how \u2018rude\u2019 I was supposedly being. \n \nShe then took the details of my ticket and said she was going to make a complaint about me.\n \nAs someone who works in customer services and conflict resolution I see the way Anita approached the situation from the moment I arrived at the train was clearly aggressive. Not at any point did she accept anything I said even when I reminded her that the announcement said two train managers. She walked away saying you are very rude loudly so the whole carriage heard.\n \nI travel by Eurostar a lot and on the whole the staff are amazing on this occasion Anita completely let the name of Eurostar down.\n\nI have raised this with support however unlike my other requests this has simply been ignored",

I arrived in plenty of time but they had reconfigured the train so the coach I was booked on was no longer running. I followed the instructions to rebook my seat and received a new seat number, but it failed to show up on their system. I was held before security at the desk for 1hr while \"computer said no\". There were several families who were split up with children having seats, but not the parents, but the staff were unable to reallocate the seating.\n\nThe staff could see available seats on the train, but they were unable to allocate them or switch them between passengers and spent >20 minutes trying to open the computer booking system. They continued to sell tickets for the following train while we were waiting, and eventually these were sold out also, so we had to wait a further hour. We were also told that seats were available in Premier Class, but they were unable to upgrade our tickets.\n\nIn total I was 2hrs delayed, having not been able to get on my scheduled train or the next one, due to incompetence and outdated computer systems. I missed my onward connection and had to pay an additional 100\u20ac for a replacement ticket. The compensation I was offered was only 50% of the original ticket price (~\u00a330).",

        "review_text": "I never had any problems with the Eurostar until the 4th of June coming back from Amsterdam due to signal failure. That's obviously out of their control but what I found so shocking, was the treatment by the staff on the ground in Amsterdam. We were already waiting for quite some time with no information, when we were told to change the platform. We were then able to board the train, but there was no information from then on. At some point I actually saw the staff pass my window with all of their cases while the passengers still sat on the train with no information. We must've sat there for another hour or so until they told us that the train was cancelled. I just really couldn't believe that they were all leaving, while we were left with no information. Absolutely shocking! I immediately booked myself on the next train going back to London in the morning and paid for it out of my own pocket before trying to find a last minute hotel. The IBIS next to the train station was the logical option, since my train was going at 7:45. So because of the delay in the information about the cancellation, the hotel price went up by nearly \u00a3100. So I turned up at 6:45 the next morning only to find that this train was cancelled too. The scenario was similar to the day before, no information of the staff who were literally standing inside the building looking at us, while we were all standing in the cold outside with no clue what was going on. They eventually came out and told us that the train was cancelled and that we would have to make our own way to Rotterdam and then take a bus to Brussels, or take a Flixbus to Brussels. It's about another two hours on the bus to get there, plus the journey to the actual bus station where the Flixbus goes from. I took up that option, but then again, Eurostar wasn't really accommodating and we felt left to our own devices. Now I only get a small amount of what I actually had to pay out of my own pockets, and they only refund you after 28 days and I don't have that disposable income to wait that long! It is really not a very good service at all. I think the problem isn't so much the issues, like signal failures or cancelled trains, it's rather the way they are responding to it, no one seems to be responsible, or takes up the task to inform customers of what's going on. I think Eurostar should start with customer service training first for their staff and then make connections to local hotels or transport companies, they can then give out vouchers and the companies then can handle the details. It doesn't take much....",

        "review_text": "A while back, I encountered a few challenges enroute to Eurostar, including cancellations out of my control, and a major incident during my journey. As a result, I was unable to reach my destination on time and had to reschedule for the following day. However, I must commend the helpfulness of Eurostar, and one particular staff member I spoke to over the phone. They guided me through the necessary procedures to change my ticket for the next available train the next morning.\nTo my surprise, when I called again to finalise the process, another staff member informed me that my request couldn't be accommodated. Determined to resolve the issue, I made another attempt and took the time to explain the situation once more. Thankfully, this time my concern was understood, and my ticket was successfully changed. Although it involved some back-and-forth and took longer than expected, I was immensely grateful and relieved that I didn't have to purchase a more expensive ticket or face additional hassles.\nIn addition to these challenges, there were some unavoidable delays during my journey with Eurostar, which coincided with fashion week. Considering the circumstances, such delays were somewhat expected. However, despite these setbacks, I found the overall experience to be positive and hassle-free. The convenience of travelling via Eurostar far outweighed the inconveniences I encountered. I am genuinely satisfied with the service and will definitely choose Eurostar again in the future, as it provides a more seamless and enjoyable alternative to air travel.",

Left the gate call until 20minutes before departure, which caused absolute carnage with the boarding, including people getting injured as it was a free for all to get on the train. The hotel we booked as a package with the train was supposed to be 3 star, But it was terrible with a very rude owner, it made fawlty towers look like a 7 star luxury resort. They obviously never stayed or checked it's credentials before making them a supplier, poorest quality of food, facilities and service i have ever experienced. Nobody ever followed up after the complaint and only offered a change of hotel, but couldn't verify the quality or location of the hotel, also offered after the check out time so we was also going to get charged for the hell hole we was in for an extra night with no offer of any financial assistance for the extra outlay or inconvenience. Really ruined a birthday treat to Paris for me and my wife. never even got a chance to follow up on the complaint or experience, Basically they had our money, the trip was over so they don't care at all.",

No problem with the staff on the train who must have to put up with this amateur management day in and day out.",

We booked 4 seats together In Standard Premier for a big anniversary trip 8 months in advance and we printed off our tickets at the time. However without any warning Eurostar rebooked  us in 4 single seats one behind the other in backward facing seats at the back of the train. Eurostar were not able to rectify the position and merely claimed that their terms and conditions allowed them to do it. The experience in Standard Premier was ok but the whole experience was spoiled by the inability of the 4 of us to celebrate our anniversary trip together. \nArrival at Gare du Nord was very poor with an 800m walk to taxis and a 30 minutes wait with no cover. \nIn view of the very high cost of Eurostar and the uncertain premium experience it is far better to fly.",

        "review_text": "Het kan ongeluk zijn dat je vertraging hebt of dat je heenreis geannuleerd wordt door werkzaamheden maar de service die geboden is verschikkelijk.\n\nDe 1e keer: Vorig jaar besloten wij naar Londen te gaan met de Eurostar met een overstap in Brussel. De communicatie rondom hoe het op Amsterdam zou gaan was onduidelijk. Wel geen paspoort/douane controle. NIemand die het wist.. Op Brussel blijkt dat onze trein meer dan 2 uur vertraging heeft door een aanrijding met een persoon. Het station Brussel is niet geschikt om zoveel mensen op te vangen dus dat was een drama maar daar kan Eurostar opzich niet veel aan doen. Hun tegemoetkoming was dat wij of een voucher kregen wat 30% van onze reissom was of cash maar dan 25%. Wij dachten dat we nog een wel een keer naar Londen zouden gaan dus kozen voor de voucher. \nBij het boeken blijkt dat de NS international goedkoper is dan de Eurostar zelf inclusief de korting op dezelfde datum en tijd. Na wat mailwisselingen en ook gebeld te hebben met de Eurostart klantenservice (waar ik 20 minuten op heb moeten wachten) bleek toch echt dat de NS international dit heel goed had ingekocht. Echter bleek NS international over de hele linie goedkoper te zijn. Waardeloze vouchers dus..\n\nDe tweede keer; we boeken in januari voor augustus en krijgen op 30 mei een mailtje dat vanwege werkzaamheden op ons opstapstation (dit keer Rotterdam) de heenreis vervalt. Je kunt je geld terugkrijgen, een voucher of een nieuwe boeking maken met de huidige dagprijs. Wij zouden met vrienden gaan die vanuit Amsterdam vertrokken maar dit is niet mogelijk. Je kon wel opnieuw boeken vanuit Amsterdam maar dan was de prijs wel 2.5 x keer zo duur.\n\nOm de reis te annuleren weer gebeld met Eurostar en weer 20 minuten in de wacht gestaan. Was inderdaad niets mogelijk. Opeens hoorde ze me niet meer en hing meteen op. Ben ook niet teruggebeld oid.\n\nVoor ons nooit meer Eurostar.",

I am traveling around once a month for work and 2-3 times year for leisure. \n\nMy recent experience has been a nightmare. I have been traveling with a toddler and being pregnant myself. We arrived on time (30 mins before) have been waiting in queue and when got to ticket check they said its too late gate is closed. I got super frustrated but they didn\u2019t want to hear a word. They made me go to their customer service at the station , queue another 15 mins to buy a new ticket FOR THE SAME TRAIN! As the train was 45 min late anyway\u2026 \n\nI raised that as a complaint and they said sorry for inconvenience we will refund as you ( as it was their lack of understanding and professionalism that caused the whole issue). \n\nI have been waiting for a month now and no refund! They confirmed to me payment was made, but my bank cannot see any trace of a pending payments. I have asked 3 times through mail for Eurostar to contact the issuer bank ( as its their responsibility to track the payment and know where it is) but they just pushed back with \u201c it has been confirmed by our finance team as being processed contact your bank\u201d. \n\nI find myself with no refund , awful service and awful experience. Eurostar used to be my go to travel service for work and leisure. Now Its my last option. What a disappointment",

The team at the passport gates stepped in to help my daughter and I through the automatic gates. And the lady at the gate allowed us through the barrier to board slightly before the main group, giving us time to get down the ramp and on board before it became too crowded. \n\nI cannot express my gratitude enough. Travelling alone with a learning disabled teenager can be extremely stressful and the kindness of Eurostar staff redeemed what had, to that point, been a really demanding and emotionally exhausting day. \n\nWell done on exceptional service which is all too rare these days.",

Do you know where the restaurant/caf\u00e9 is, I mean where can I buy coffee?\" I'm not a native English speaker but I don't think I said something very rude... In reply she says, \"Well good morning to you too!\" In a very insinuating tone, as if I should have said good morning and Hi wasn't polite, or what?

        "review_text": "Ik adviseer iedereen om NIET met Eurostar te reizen. Vorige week heb ik twee tickets geboekt van Amsterdam naar Londen. In de teksten rondom het boeken van de tickets wordt steeds aangeprezen dat je heel makkelijk je reis kunt omboeken. Ik had niet eens het idee dat dat nodig zou zijn, maar helaas bleek al snel dat ik mijn weekend Londen op een andere datum zou moeten doen. Toen ik probeerde om te boeken, bleek dat er geen enkele mogelijkheid tot eind van 2023 is om zowel een heen- als terugreis te boeken naar Londen. Meestal is er sowieso helemaal geen mogelijkheid, alle treinen zaten vol. Hier en daar is er een weekend dat je wel heen maar niet terug kan of omgekeerd. Kijk, als ik dat had geweten, had ik natuurlijk niet geboekt. Ik ben op de website gaan kijken wat ik nu moest doen. Er wordt je op alle mogelijke manieren afgeraden om te bellen met Eurostar omdat ze het zo druk hebben. Ik kan geeneens het telefoonnummer vinden! Dus heb ik het contactformulier ingevuld met mijn vragen. Antwoord: er zijn veel werkzaamheden op het spoor daarom zijn er geen reismogelijkheden. Mochten die er wel zijn, dan wordt dat op de site gepubliceerd. Dus het komt erop neer dat ik niet meer kan gaan dit jaar tenzij ik de site in de gaten ga houden. En alleen kan gaan als het Eurostar uitkomt. Als het al uitkomt. Nu heb ik het formulier ingevuld dat ik dan mijn geld terugwil, ook al is aangegeven dat je je geld niet terugkrijgt. Ik vind dat ik misleid ben en dat op die regel moet worden teruggekomen. Maar op mijn reactie wordt nu niet meer gereageerd. Ben zo ontzettend aan het balen. Meer dan 400 euro weg en in Londen zit ik zeker niet. Ik vind het oplichting.",

Exhorbitant snacks. Thankfully we bought food from 'Pauls' at St. Pancras before boarding.   Eurostar offers not much choice of 4* hotels.  Mercure Midi was only 4 minutes from station, but hotel situated on main road which was mostly boarded up with major, major roadworks upheaval.  Whichever route we needed to walk we had to negotiate a huge roundabout with, again, major roadworks which one could not see beyond, so directions were difficult to follow.  The area surrounding hotel very run down and felt unsafe in evening.   Not a decent restaurant found within 10 mins of hotel.  Most were closed (maybe open in evenings) or by station, which were overpriced for sub standard or mediocre food. Hotel map useless.  When it rained/poured, every road and crossing became a bed of mud from roadworks, and deep puddles.  Eurostar should have checked out conditions of hotel they supplied.    I'm having difficulty in reaching them to complain, emails not going through (unrecognised)- their form menu does  not have a useful listing for this complaint.  I do not think hotel is quite 4* standard, but new spa is very nice, which has no doubt raised their rating.  Desk staff each gave different directions to city centre, marking the maps for us.  2 hours out of our way first time. Half hour + the next trip.   Only one resident of the area gave true directions - so easy - max 15-20 mins.  So many roadworks over Brussels made walking difficult with  many hazards.",

We will forever be grateful to them all for making a huge difference to a very stressful 24hrs.

Vervolgens werd onze reis met een enorm onduidelijke omweg omgeboekt naar de reis van 18:01 uur. Ook deze trein had enorm veel vertraging opgelopen waardoor we pas om 19:23 vertrokken. Al met al een vertraging van 06:22 min. \nDe klantenservice van Eurostar zegt hierin dat onze reis maar een vertraging had van 82 min (gerekend vanaf 18:01u) en we alleen hiervoor een compensatie kunnen krijgen. \nZelfs na een uitleg vanuit onze kant, blijven zij bij dit statement. Absoluut geen goede/meedenkende klantenservice. Het voelt alsof de klant hierin dubbel gestraft wordt. \nVoor ons geen Eurostar meer en zal deze manier van reizen dan ook zeker niet aanraden.",

I have to say the lovely people assisting us on the train were amazing, making sure we were fed and watered, putting up with the odd grumpy person with grace and calmness.  As for Eurostar, knowing the issues caused by your faulty train and the delays caused, making sure there were enough taxis and rooms booked or set aside for us all would have been a good idea. However, you left us stranded in London at midnight, no visible staff to help us find accommodation or a cab home. We now have the joys of trying to claim back all the incurred costs, the train tickets we were unable to use, overnight accommodations and a very expensive ride home at peak times this morning! I will be objecting to any future plans to travel via a Eurostar train in future. In our eyes, you will forever be Eurnostar.",

        "review_text": "Booked via Eurostar because we wanted to be more environmentally friendly than flying (which would have been cheaper). If all the trains had been on time/not cancelled it may have been worth it... but that's not the case. Okay, delays happen, trains get cancelled. The real annoyance is the fact that Eurostar make it incredibly difficult to contact their customer services (only an online form available), which they still haven't responded to 3 working days later.\n\nOur connection from Amsterdam to Brussel (run by Thalys), scheduled for 27/03 was cancelled on 22/03 due to upcoming strike action... plenty of time for Eurostar to inform us of alternative arrangements. They never did. And they never responded to our Customer Services requests.\n\nMaybe Eurostar never identified that one of their advertised connecting trains had been cancelled? If true, that's very awkward since Thalys is part of Eurostar Group. It's the same company, yet they aren't aware of cancellations across the group.\n\nNow Eurostar tells us to get a refund from Thalys, Thalys tells us to get a refund from Eurostar. Great working together there...\n\nI give two stars (rather than one), because onboard + station staff are fantastic at trying to help out... unfortunately their HQ teams are letting their front-line staff down massively.\n\nEdit: Two points I forgot to mention.\n1) Our Customer Service form was initially + automatically marked as resolved without any sort of response from Eurostar.\nAnd 2) In the time we've been waiting for a response from Eurostar, their marketing has sent at least 3 emails encouraging us to buy more tickets from them/book future journeys... it feels like they focus on marketing to the detriment of customer service and general operations/good service.",

But sadly the poor accessibility to speak to Eurostar beforehand when I tried to arrange a gluten-free meal for my young son and the company's lack of empathy afterwards when I complained has put me off travelling with them again. Chloe from Eurostar tried to say I should have booked it earlier but when you are a new customer like I was, I found their website, app and contact-ability almost impossible. The end result was that my 12-year-old had to watch me and his mother eat while he had very little to eat. Not nice. Chloe pretty much said 'sorry but that's your fault for not booking it on our app' ... very cold reply. Sorry Eurostar, lovely smooth journey, nice onboard staff, but with admin staff like that I shall avoid Eurostar in future.",

Then give people at least a voucher for the amount of 20 Euros. But not that itself.\n\nSo I have made my decision Never book through the site of Eurostar on the internet again. \n\nI have another item that I want to report, namely The site says the following:\n\nYou can already request a discount of \u20ac12 for a next trip.\n\nUntil you try this, you get this as an answer:\nThis option is temporarily unavailable\nSorry, we'll be reintroducing this option soon.\n\nWhen people want to reach you by phone, they have the choice between different languages, so I pressed 3 for Dutch and the lady started saying Sorry, but I only speak English.\n\nWhere has your service gone Eurostar??\n\nThis is the 1st time I experience such practices.

        "review_text": "I was returning from winter walking in Austria yesterday. I took the 13.47 train from Amsterdam to London. I had equipment including an ice axe securely packed in my suitcase which I told them about in accordance with their rules. Despite this item being permitted (essential for what I'd been doing) it was confiscated. I asked the surly, functional security man \"Why?\" He said it wasn't permitted on Eurostar. I said it was and it was fine on the way out. Nope. I knew if I pushed it I would be taken aside so I asked if it could be put in the care of the guard. \"No!\" I asked if it could be given to someone who could use it and was told \"No, it gets thrown away!\" What a complete waste! How do I know these people don't just flog it off? It is theft because their own rules say it is ok. Searching the internet this has been a recurring problem and Eurostar have recently clarified their policy to confirm it's ok as long as you tell them, which I did. I only did this trip by train to be a bit greener but never again. It all looks good until you have an issue. Most reputable companies respond to Trustpilot posts but this is not the case with any of the (mostly terrible) reviews on here. I have asked for compensation and an apology but I doubt I'll get it. Perhaps someone needs to take them to court. As is typical with a monopoly they don't care. Why IS it a monopoly anyway? That's not what was envisaged originally. The train trip was ok but they have lost my future custom",

Eurostar are refusing voucher or to liaise with third party to organise refund. So now have to go go through credit cards and small claims to get money back. It's not cheap and they just expect people to be down money because they can't organise themselves or speak to their booking partners.\n\nI would have happily accepted voucher and spent more money traveling with them but now I just want the refund as they are an absolute joke of a company and will never use again.",

        "review_text": "Travelled back from Disneyland Paris on the 14th. We were one of the lucky ones who managed to get on the train home. However I was witness to almost 300 people including children, toddlers, disabled people and the elderly that did not get on the train home. Thankfully we did not listen to the Eurostar staff telling people the train was delayed and we were to go back to the park and return at 4pm. If we had we would also have been left stranded in Paris. The staff were directing people to \u2018go over there\u2019 and not to a particular queue. There were 4 queues. 1 - arriving customers, 2 - people trying to drop off luggage, 3 - people trying to collect luggage and 4 - people trying to leave that had their luggage. Everyone was just joining any queue creating a mass issue and ultimately the reason so many people were left behind. The problem could have so easily been avoided by having competent staff directing people to the right queue and by starting check in early. For us boarding started at 16:15 and ended at 16:50. There was no physical way 400-500 people could have been checked in on time. They knew this and still allowed it to continue. Once the train left, the staff went home and got the remaining customers thrown out by the police into the freezing cold. No hotel, no means of getting home. Just \u2018try getting to Paris and see if you can get home from there\u2019. No money to do this. Eurostar you are a disgrace and I will never travel with you again and I will share my experience with anyone that will listen!!",

        "review_text": "I purchased a return Business Premier ticket London Amsterdam (approx 5 times more expensive than an airplane ticket with luggage). This is what to expect. \n\n1. Dirty seats. The staff had to clean it and in doing so dropped crumbs amd soap foam onto my breakfast tray. The utter unprofessionalism would have made me laugh in pity had it not been for the high price of the ticket. \n\n2. Free Wifi \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05 Oh yes. Small detail is that the WiFi connection doesn't provide you with reliable internet access. For 80% of the trip it's impossible to work. Your own SIM card works far better. I am stopped in Brussels station at the moment  my SIM card picks up max 4G and the WiFi on the train takes about 60 seconds to load the Google page. All the investment they made into the service and they can't get WiFi properly engineered. I wonder, maybe it was a Belgian engineer. \n\n3. The blinds on the windows don't prevent the sun from coming in at all. Maybe because they want you to have some sun after being deep under the sea. Cute of them.\n\n4. There is no accessible premier lounge in Amsterdam. They will force you into the terminal 45 min prior to departure and keep you in a cramped space with no seating space. Business Premier Lounge promised as part of the ticket. In London maybe, not in Amsterdam.\n\n5. It's cold in the top Business Class Cabin. Feet and legs freezing. The air circulation is as good as a cheap car from 2014. \n\nAlso I feel the need to mention that the waiters and the managers have so much to learn when it comes to basic service and professionalism. I do wonder where they recruit them from and what kind of training they get. \n\nHow, on earth, do they get away with it? Never again, at least with a flight it only last 40 mins, it's cheaper. Don't give these thugs your money.",

I have to disclose my health issues so he could stop harassing me while I was crying.\n\nYou know what the Eurostar customer service thinks about enabling an aggressor on the train? We are sorry but nothing else we can do. Shame on you and all the services which allow xenophobia and abusing a person in a status of handicap.",

Incompetent and surly staff moving queues around seemingly at random and don't even seem to be working on the same system - one guy moving people from the front of the queue to the back and another taking them back to the front again.\n\nSecurity was abysmal and poor signage for passport control saw many people directed to the wrong machines which somehow work even less well than the ones at Gatwick.\n\nThen you are dumped in a filthy crowded space to wait for the trains, toilets were grim. Some of the escalators to the trains were broken.\n\nThe train itself crowded, overheated and smelly with the caridge fittings looking distinctly tired and worn. It was at least cleaner than the station.\n\nClearly Brexit had imposed some practical challenges on the Eurostar. But inadequate training for staff and poor planning at every stage of the in-station process make a small problem far larger and leave the Eurostar unfit for purpose and to be avoided as far as possible.",

The Thalys train (ticket provided by Eurostar) was cancelled and no information provided anywhere. Eurostar guided us to international train information where they didn't know what to do. When arriving at Brussels we had to buy new tickets for the slower IC service from our own pocket. There was no information then or now, and the Eurostar website says there is no compensation. I emailed Eurostar and after a very long time received an automated response asking if my query was somehow resolved now considering they had not taken any action... After another response I received a personal email, saying they could only refund the ticket Brussels-Ams that I paid out of my own pocket. This is unacceptable.\nTIP: Take care when booking a ticket for Amsterdam, make sure you have a DIRECT connection without Thalys as they get cancelled frequently - this is not very clear on the Eurostar website when booking.",

        "review_text": "I couldnt even take the trip. When the borders closed between england and France on Christmas 2021, Eurostar issued refunds in form of vouchers, which we could use to book another journey. The issue was these vouchers had an expiry date. I tried to redeem the voucher only to relaise I was two days past the expiry date, after mutliple days trying to reach the customer service through emails and hours waiting on the phone they eventually got back to me with no solution, so I just practically donated money to Eurostar. They have by far the worst customer service...hard to reach with zero solutions.",

Flights were organised at great expense and now the trains were announced as reinstated yesterday - 2 whole days after they were cancelled with still no response from Customer Service. Of course, the only options available were to change either the train times or keep our tickets because Eurostar understands that we would want this due to the disruption? What a joke of a company that states \u201cSimple and generous compensation policy for delays or cancellations\u201d as one of the reasons to travel with them.

        "review_text": "A one-star rating is too good for Eurostar.  I booked a train in July 2021 for a return trip to EuroDisney the following February.  In the November 2021 Eurostar informed me that the direct service was cancelled and that they'd changed it to Paris Gar du Nord only, further advising on multi-leg local services for the final part of the journey.  COVID restrictions at EuroDisney then forced a delay in holiday plans for a year so I tried to change my train booking to suit.  Initially there was nothing available on the chosen dates according to Eurostar so I then made an interim return booking, with the plan that I would amend these new dates when the service was again available on the actual dates coinciding with my holiday.  A couple of months later Eurostar then informed me that the return journey had been cancelled, so I tried to cancel the outbound journey as well to then book a new journey to match the holiday.  Once again the Eurostar on-line booking system showed no availability.  I then contacted Customer Service and waited a week before someone got back to me, via email.  The representative advised that she couldn't make amendments either due to an apparent IT issue.  By this time the outward journey of my interim booking had passed so I contacted Customer Services again and actually spoke to someone who advised that, due to my ticket status as showing expired, the system was not allowing changes to be made.  I then explained about the email I'd received from one of her colleagues and was advised that the IT issue was still causing problems and that I would be contacted when it was fixed.  That was over a week ago and I've still heard nothing.  If I do get to EuroDisney I'll make sure I never use Eurostar again.  Totally abysmal service and very amateurish.",

This was very upsetting for her and also embarrassing for me as I had to move four times as more passengers got onto the train and found I was sitting in their pre-booked seats.\nEventually I was able to find a permanent seat for the journey once the train started moving, but my daughter was very upset that she had to sit alone for the whole journey and I was extremely disappointed that despite booking our tickets back in May I almost found myself without a seat for the journey home and that there was no assistance from Eurostar staff. \nI emailed them when I got home to complain and have only just received a lame response today (a month and half later) saying they would pass it on to their cleaning team and that seats aren't guaranteed??!!! \nIf we go back we will be flying next time as it is about a third of the cost of this overpriced train run by people who clearly couldn't care less about their customers - and if we pre-book seats we will actually get to sit in them.",

        "review_text": "Very disappointed with Eurostar's unaccomodating handling of my relative's inability - due to the UK rail strikes - to reach London to catch his booked Eurostar train to Brussels, as no local trains running on that day. My brother tried to move his ticket on by a day, but was told he will be charged \u00a3133 for the privilege even though not his fault. This uncaring company's attitude is obviously: you sort it out yourself, not our problem. No flexibility at all & no chance of compensation if you're stuck.\nWe became aware of the planned national rail strike before the weekend, so we tried to get in touch with Eurostar which proved impossible: you cannot call them, only email, facebook & twitter messaging so I sent repeated requests to which I did not receive a reply until Monday. Very frustrating. Email was simply responded to automatically by resending the original booking confirmation which is totally useless. \nTerrible customer service by this uncaring company which misuses tax payers money. They have recently closed down two essential Kent stations, Ashford Int'l and Ebbsfleet, and are now saying are not going to reopen for years if at all, taking access away from local people who had to fund these huge projects through their taxes and put up with years of disruption by the building of this new rail line. \nA couple of years ago my relative could board his Eurostar train at our local station Ashford Intl, serving Kent was the reason for these prestigious new stations being built after all. Instead he now has to take a local train from Ashford up to St Pancras London (and pay extra) before coming all the way back down on the Eurostar passing both Ebbsfleet & Ashford stations without stopping. Utterly ridiculous and disgraceful!! We'll take the ferry next time!",

They never have enough staff to get people through the queues, and today we have been delayed for hours waiting in the passport queue because the waiting area was completely full. This has happened repeatedly this year, even the business lounge has been standing room only on several occasions including today. We paid for access to the lounge and were denied access because it was too full. On previous occasions there have been no coffee cups available so no coffee. I travel by train because I want to be more eco-friendly, but Eurostar does a terrible job. Less Euro Star than Euro Trash.",

I felt I had no choice.\nToday is exactly 2 months to my due travel date but the refund form which I am directed to complete says my train is not cancelled.\nSome digging of my own indicates the train is terminating at Brussels but is effectively cancelled for my destination of Amsterdam.\nAll I wanted to do was speak to someone. The call centre (which was not free anyway) now no longer accepts calls. It tells you this in 3 languages. Use the form it says! The form to which nobody responds.\nEUROSTAR all I want is a swift refund of my money for a service you can no longer provide.\nAnyone else tried the chatbot?

Tot zover\u2026 \nOp vrijdag zouden we eind van de middag met de Eurostar teruggaan vanaf Londen naar Amsterdam. Daar hadden we ook de tickets voor bij ons. Echter op de Woensdag ervoor kregen wij een mail van Eurostar met de mededeling dat onze trein niet zou rijden ivm de stakingen van de NS in Nederland. We kregen een aantal opties. 1) omboeken naar een ander tijdstip 2) e-voucher aanvragen voor een later tijdstip. \nWe probeerde een ander tijdstip in de dagen erna. Alle treinen waren al volgeboekt. Dus.. dan ga je verder denken\u2026 we moeten toch naar huis. Dan maar met het vliegtuig. \nNu zijn we alweer een week thuis en proberen de gemaakte extra kosten terug te vorderen. Maar dat gaat niet zo gemakkelijk. \nDe reisverzekering zegt: Wij kunnen niks voor u doen op dit gebied, u koet het bij Eurostar zelf proberen te claimen. Eurostar zelf heeft een klantenservice van lik me vestje en zijn niet te bereiken. \nToen via de rechtsbijstand geprobeert. Ook die komen met een antwoord wat je niet verwacht. \nU heeft rechtsbijstand voor zaken die betrekking hebben op alles binnen de EU. Eurostar is een Engels bedrijf en ze kunnen dus geen zaak aanspannen tegen hun. In feite ben je gewoon je centen kwijt a \u20ac428. Er is nog 1 optie en dat is naar de kantonrechter stappen. \nMensen! Denk goed na voor je met de Eurostar naar Londen gaat want als ze je trein annuleren ga je geheit voor de bijl! Wees gewaarschuwt!! Volgende keer weer lekker vliegen",

There were no green fire exit signs in the whole place we could see. If there had been an emergency there would have been very serious problems.\n\nWhen they called our train, they chose a platform with only one working walkway, causing an even bigger crush. Somebody hit the emergency stop, and everybody went flying.\n\nI urge the London Fire Brigade to close this potentially very dangerous building down, until Eurostar make it safe.",

Due to a delay in our connection from Genk (BE) we arrived at 14h27 at the gate; one minute after it formally closed. We explained to a Dutch speaking female employee around 30 years old why we were one minute too late and politely asked her if we might still board, since we had an urgent meeting in London. We got absolutely zero compassion from your employee nor her manager (named Gunther). They were like a computer, repeatedly naming their policy, stating they could make no exceptions because then \"they had to let everyone through who was late\". Weird, since we were the only people queueing at that point. I was surprised and to be honest quite upset by her total lack of humanity and flexibility, so my responses became angrier. Your employee reacted to this from her own emotions and made several angry and hurtful comments. The only option she had to offer was to book the same train two hours later, which would cause us a lot of stress and trouble considering our schedule. On top of that, she actually blamed us for taking the seats of two other passengers who had been waiting for two days now. That one really hurt. So unprofessional. When I asked for her name, she refused to give it, saying whe was only doing her job. At that point, my girlfriend interrupted because I was getting angry. We left with the alternative tickets. Not a nice way to start what's supposed to be a relaxing holiday. I request a appropriate explanation and compensation for our discomfort as paying customers.",

After completing the card security checks we were not taken to a confirmation page, nor did she receive a confirmation email, nor is it showing up in her account. Instead the page we were taken to just had Checkout in big letters and some T&C\u2019s stuff at the bottom. There was nothing to click and we tried clicking everything. When refreshing the page as there was no refresh waning on this page we were taken back to the start of payment. When I checked my credit card statement there was a pending transaction for the amount of the trip. \n\nThe next morning my daughter attempted to reach out to customer service, their phone lines are closed to \u201cdeal increased volumes of calls\u201d (which to me sounds like BS, seriously c\u2019mon people.)\n\nInstead we followed their instructions and filled out the email contact form. Almost immediately she received an automated email confirming her enquiry had been logged and that they aim to get back with in 28 days. (Again people this is not good enough. What if your travelling tomorrow? As it is 28 days is after the holiday is planned for). \n\nAs a response had not been received yesterday a second attempt at booking was made to avoid further increases in cost and for seats/hotel getting sold out with the same result. \n\nAs of this morning the original bookings pending transaction has been refunded and the second bookings transaction is currently pending. She is currently attempting to contact the customer service team via a DM to @eurostar and @eurostaruk on twitter. She is still waiting for a response.",

        "review_text": "30 August 2022\n\nDear Sir/Madam\n\n\n\nI would like to bring to your attention a case of exemplary customer service!\n\nduring a visit to Paris on 18/08/22,\u00a0 I was travelling back from Paris Gare du Nord to London St Pancras International I left my rucksack behind me while i was in business lounge waiting for my train 9043 at 16:13 and release Letterly after the train has left the station, I was panicking as it contained all my medicine and my money and other important stuff.\nThe first thing\u00a0 I have done it is I approached one of on board service staff which i explained to her what happened to me\u00a0 she was very\u00a0 polite ;\u00a0 she reassured me that i don't need to be worry\u00a0 everything should be alright;\u00a0 she contacted the train manager after a while he came all the way to my seat e introduced himself as Frederik train manager he asked me to give him the description of my rucksack and the location he quickly act and contacted Gare du Nord Eurostar\u00a0 terminal to chase it, he later on he came back to me and informed that they find it and he informed me that\u00a0 I will be reunited with my bag tomorrow. I left my details and my contact number to him .\nI believe Mr Frederik has arranged something in a professional way and manner with his colleague Mr Blake.\nThe next day received a phone call from Blake, he introduced himself and briefly told me about how I can collect my rucksack from St Pancras station.after he gave the trai trai ID 9007 and arrival time.  I was delighted and happy when Mr Blake hand in my rucksack to me by asking to check if everything is in there which I did ..I looked at him i was speechless and same time happy for two reasons, first the action from both train manager showed the team work and second restoring my trust on such big company as Eurostar.\nI felt that both train manager Frederik's and Blake actions showed exceptional customer service and as such deserve due recognition. In this day and age people are quick to complain but seldom take the time to show praise and both them deserve a pat on the back for their excellent level of service .\n\nPlease extend my thanks to them once again\n\nKind regards",

Customer services had switched off their phones, the website was useless, and their advice was to fill in an email form - which being a Mon to Fri business - meant there was no response until today!

        "review_text": "Travelled from London to Paris Gare du Nord in the hot weather on 18th July 22. The train was delayed by 3 hours by signal failure in France, so we were told.  However, later trains than ours went before us. They didn't transfer delayed customers onto the next available train. Very poor customer lounge crowded with delayed travellers. Nothing was offered, not even water despite the heat. No information given to customers about the likely length of delay.  There were many angry customers. Eventually the train was replaced for reasons that were never explained.  The equipment on the replacement train was not working so food and drink facilities were limited.  Overall a very poor experience.  Understand the rail system was stressed on that day but Eurostar utterly failed to manage that situation.\n It's two stars rather than one because they did offer compensation and they did pay it. However, it took them a month to get around to paying and there was no acknowledgement of the compensation claim. No customer enquiry telephone line, only a contact form on the website.  When we submitted a query we got no answer.  The only way to see if your compensation claim is in the system is to try and submit it again.\nConsidering how expensive it was relative to say, Easyjet, (about twice the price); Eurostar is poor value for money and badly managed.  We won't be using them again.",

Train was shown as on time.  Huge queue for immigration, as usual, but went through OK. Train still shown as on time, but the departure time came and went with no announcement.  A large crowd gathered around the boarding area in the heat. But still no boarding and still no announcement. Then finally they announce  a \"small\" delay and boarding in a few minutes, which turned about to be twenty minutes. Then a mad scramble to get on the train, since everyone's seat had been cancelled and it was now free seating.  The situation was very badly handled and the absence of information caused physical distress to older passengers who  stood waiting  in the heat for forty minutes to try to board first and get seats near their families. \nTrain finally arrived over an hour late in London. A few days later I got a message inviting me to apply for compensation  but the Eurostar system won't recognise the ticket number they gave me in the very same email inviting me to ask for compensation. Their call centre is unreachable and they don't respond to requests for help from their online forms.  All in all, it is a company that needs new management and a sense of customers service.",

Even though it may seem long.\n\n3 days after I made the booking that was not. Logged into my credit card and found 2 transactions plus and minus.\n\nContacted the credit card and they confirm the payment had been returned.\n\nI did not speak with them \nThe credit card company did not speak with them \nBegs the question, what the **** happened.\n\nI proceeded to book the hotel and train separately myself. \nCost a sum more but it\u2019s a better hotel and I feel better because I have the train tickets and the hotel confirmation.\n\nIn summary\nA company that cannot be contacted j would suggest customers should think carefully and perhaps do the wise thing and stay clear",

        "review_text": "Poeh, wat een negatieve score krijgt Eurostar!\n\nWaarschijnlijk gaat deze review kris kras door elkaar, but bare with me!\n\n\nIk ben vertrokken in Juni van Amsterdam naar London. Het eerste wat mij opviel (wat niet te verwijten is aan eurostar?) hoe extreem asociaal de Marechaussee was! Zij drukte letterlijk oude mensen aan de kant om ''eerst'' naar binnen te gaan. Ik stond er echt even van te kijken. De check in ging echt suuuuper snel! Dit terwijl het wel super druk was. Het is echt lopende bandwerk, en to be honest, mijn voorkeur gaat uit naar vluchtigheid, proces en soepel verlopen. Dus ik verwacht en eis niet een ''lach'' of een ''goed woordje'' van elke euro star medewerker. In de wachthal, wat ontzettend ruim was, is het inderdaad wel karrig. Een snoep machine en banken + stoelen. Helaas waren er flink wat arrogante britten die lang uit gingen liggen op de banken waardoor mensen staand moesten wachten, wederom niet de schuld van Eurostar MAAR : ik miste hier een medewerker, iemand die een rondje liep die vragen kon beantwoorden en dus dit soort zaken kon oppakken. Je moet inderdaad wel even wachten voordat de trein aankomt, het is minder comfortabel dan Schiphol waar je honderden meters kunt lopen en ontzettend veel winkeltjes hebt. Maar goed, dit weet je van te voren.\n\nDe trein was prima, ontzettend schoon? Nee, dat niet. Ik zat bij een raam met het geluk dat ik bij omboeking een eerste klas kaartje had. Dus een stoeltje alleen :D . Het raampje had nog een vette kuif afdruk van de persoon die voor mij op de plek heeft gezeten. Ik heb de heen weg geen vertraging op gelopen, de trein voelde soepel en ging lekker snel. Ik kreeg ook nog eten! Tjah, het is en blijft ''vervoervoer''. Ik verwachte niet een vers bakkersbroodje uit Parijs met zalm uit de noorse rivieren en zeewier van Korea. Het is maar wat je verwacht en hoe je bent ingesteld. Ik vond het prima! En ik zat er vol van, dat is voor mij het belangrijkste.\n\nEngland was super, lekker veel Harry Potter dingen gedaan :P\n\nNu de terug weg.... Dit ging (veel) minder vlot.\n\nDe wachtruimte bij Kings Cross was nog minder comfortabel dan die in Amsterdam. En je raad het al , 1 uur vertraging terwijl ik mijn boekje zat te lezen op een houten stoel. Maar toch, viel mij op dat de medewerkers daar ontzettend aardig waren! In de trein was ging alles weer vlot. Wederom had ik een gelukje, ik had namelijk een normal seat, en zat naast een vent die later gewoon een eigen plekje kon gaan zoeken. Tijden het rijden kregen we nog eens 30 minuten vertraging. Mensen... het zijn spoorwegen, vertraging gebeurd nou eenmaal. Daar kun je boos op worden (zoals ik in veel reviews lees) maar het lijkt me sterk dat Eurostart dit met opzet doet. Onmacht heet zoiets.\n\nAl met al was mijn ervaring met Eurostar dus eigenlijk echt wel goed! En let er op , veel reviews die ik heb gelezen, heeft te maken met Covid. Gecancelde treinen waarbij mensen een (niet)werkende voucher hebben gekregen, dat lijkt mij ook superkut. Ook lees ik veel over vertraging en mensen die niet meer mee mochten omdat ze zelf niet goed hebben gelezen op de ticket > 45min voor vertrek aanwezig zijn. Waar ik wel van schrik is de service die mensen ervaren als ze bellen... daar heb ik zelf geen ervaring mee. Ook was ik nog super bang, want ik heb gereisd een dag na de grootste UK Train strike. Dus ik zag de bui al aankomen... maar nee hoor, alles ging dus goed!\n\nZou ik het adviseren? Nou dat ligt er aan. Vind je treinen super interessant? Of ga je met zn 4en en je wilt lekker een wijntje drinken met wat nootjes? Dan zal ik Eurostar adviseren. Maar als een single trip, ga ik liever (achteraf) met het vliegtuig. Vergeet niet, als je met de trein naar London gaat dan ben je totaal 4.5 uur onderweg. Met de vliegtuig is het ook ongeveer 4.5. Maar van de 4.5 zit je bij de trein... IN DE TREIN, dus 4.5 uur op dezelfde plek, zelfde stoel met ''genoeg'' beenruimte. Terwijl je met het vliegtuigje hooguit een 1.5 uur in het vliegtuig zit en de overige uren lekker kunt shoppen en wandelen op schiphol. Voor mij was het prijs technisch ook niet perse goedkoper dan vliegen...\n\nDus, puntje bij paaltje : Naar mijn mening verdient Eurostar zeker geen 1.5 ster. Ik geef ze 3 sterren. De 2 sterren die er af gaan zijn door de lack van personeel in de wachtruimtes, de toch-niet-zo-schone stoelen/ramen in de trein/ en de karrige 20.50,- vergoeding die ik heb gekregen voor 1.5 uur vertraging. Dit terwijl mijn kaartjes bij elkaar opgeteld meer dan 300,- was. \n\nAls je met Eurostar reist : Succes! Hoop dat je een goede reis hebt :)",

Eurostar (Shaun) say this is due to the fact the booking was made through e-voucher. This is true, however we only used an e-voucher as they cancelled our previous booking!\n\nAs an aside, the customer service on the day of the delay was also hopeless. We were stuck in Paris station with no water, air con or communication for 7+ hours along with ~3k other passengers. I understand problems on the line can happen, but you are in control of how you treat your customers thereafter, something you chose to overlook.\n\nGive me the cash refund I am entitled to as I will not be travelling with you again.",

Tried again later (hint: they don't tell you this but press 1 to skip announcements - not that this will help much) and queued for 45 mins before giving up. Tried yet again later and there was an announcement saying they were not accepting any more calls that day. It's an absolute disgrace. I know perfectly well that I am simply shouting into the void by posting this review, but at least it's therapy of sorts. All I can say is that if you have to travel by Eurostar don't on any account use their hotel booking service because it's rubbish and probably won't save you any money.",

        "review_text": "Dinsdag 19 juli zou ik met twee vriendinnen een week naar Londen gaan. Aangekomen op Rotterdam Centraal bleek er een storing te zijn op het internationale treinnetwerk, waardoor er geen treinen meer reden naar Brussel/Londen. Een uur voor vertrek kregen wij in Rotterdam te horen dat de trein door de storing die avond niet meer ging rijden. Er was geen informatie op de borden en er was niets te vinden op de website van Eurostar. Wat onze alternatieven waren, kon het personeel ons ook niet vertellen. 's Avonds belden we met NS International en die kon ons alleen vertellen dat er donderdag nog een trein naar Londen ging die nog niet volgeboekt was. Op de website van de Eurostar stond dat alle treinen voor de rest van de week volgeboekt zouden zijn; inclusief de trein van donderdag (advies NS International). Kortom, er was geen trein meer die wij die week konden pakken om alsnog naar Londen te reizen. Onze vakantie viel dus gelijk in het water.\n\nNu alles niet door kon gaan wilden wij onze (hotel)kosten terugvragen. Het Hilton-hotel was via booking.com betaald en die willen niets terugbetalen. Door de overmacht - veroorzaakt door de storing bij Eurostar - vinden wij dat Eurostar alle kosten moet vergoeden; reis- en verblijfskosten. \n\nDe klantenservices van Eurostar is op geen enkele wijze te bereiken. Het enige telefoonnummer dat te vinden is op de website, is alleen voor toekomstige reizen. Als je deze probeert te bellen, dan krijg je te horen dat de lijn overbezet is en word je uit de lijn gegooid. Een andere optie is het contactformulier op de website invullen, zodat Eurostar met jou contact opneemt. Echter, ik heb deze al drie keer ingevuld in de afgelopen week en ik heb nog geen e-mail of belletje van de Eurostar gehad. Voor ons nooit meer reizen met Eurostar! Een organisatie waar de klantenservice niet van functioneert en die je als reiziger in de kou laat staan.",

And, to be fair, everything related to the travel went well- passing through security js fairly fast, and simpler than security at the airport as there are less restrictions. However, I didn\u2019t have a nice experience because of a single employee.\nWhen waiting for my turn at security, this employee proceeded to tell me to move forward. However, people were in front of me and all spots were used, as such I waited for a space to open- this is my fault, and I should have still listened to him (though I\u2019m still unsure as to what exactly he expected me to do)- and when I finally went ahead, he proceeded to treat me like an idiot because I didn\u2019t do what he told me to do. I understand I should have listened to him but I don\u2019t believe I deserved to be humiliated, and this caused me to feel bad for the rest of the trip (silly, isn\u2019t it). \n\nThis was my own personal experience, and this single interaction doesn\u2019t mean the Eurostar service is bad- however it didn\u2019t make my experience of it enjoyable.",

Klanten service voor eventueel omboeken of restitutie niet te bereiken. Formulier online ingevuld, krijg je bericht dat je het alleen kunt inleveren als trein geannuleerd is!? Dat was hij ook!!! Uiteindelijk reactie van 3 verschillende mensen via Facebook die waarschijnlijk het zelfde formulier in hebben geprobeerd te vullen, met de reactie dat het niet lukt en een verwijzing naar een link waar je niks mee kan. Naar ons geld kunnen we waarschijnlijk fluiten. Nooit meer met de Eurostar. Een 1000 euro kostende teleurstelling.",

Unprofessional, no customer service at all. \nWhat is the point in insurance if you cannot contact them when needed.\nAbsolutely disgusting way to treat people.

At St Pancras I was booted out of the line with two young children and told it wasnt open until 20 mins later depsite another member of staff telling me to queue in that line, then a minute later someone else opened it up again and I was stuck at the back. \n\nAt Gare Du Nord we were penned into sections that seem to be completely jumbled up with different train times, queues for ticket changes, family passport queue took forever, then had to run with 2 under 3s to make the train. \n\nNot an easy or pleasant experience for families and I will be taking the plane next time.",

The good: Eurostar gave us 46 euros voucher for the inconvenience. I would have preferred cash back, but oh well, nice gesture. When coming back from London, we arrived quite late at St Pancras, but because my husband had a clutch, everybody was extremly nice to us and they made sure we didn't wait in the long queue to check in and have our passports checked. Definitely a better service than most flight companies nowadays.",

I cannot believe that they do this multiple times a day, every day. \n\nTrying to change a ticket on the UK side  (after they cancelled a train) was like a kafkaesque nightmare. \u201cDo it online\u201d the website suggested. Nope, it wouldn\u2019t allow us to split the booking which we needed to do as one passenger needed to travel on a later train from the rest of us. \u201cCall us because you can\u2019t do it online\u201d they then instructed me. Ok, so I tried that but didn\u2019t even make a phone queue. The recorded message suggested I email. At this point I had no faith in an email being effective - if there were no staff to answer phones who would deal with emails? - so I decided to go at Pancras well before our rescheduled journey and do it in person. Well even that didn\u2019t work. There were TWO staff members dealing with a mile long queue of desperate travellers trying to reschedule trips due to train cancellations because the system wouldn\u2019t let them do it online and the phone service was non-existent. We finally got to the front of the queue and watched as the poor attendants computer timed out as she tried to reschedule my husband\u2019s ticket. She shrugged and said \u201cI can\u2019t help - try emailing\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s just a farcical level of service. Both trains were late. On one my seat reclined of its own free will with every bend in the track.\n\nLook we did at least arrive alive (although I am assuming that because we are not actually there yet - I am writing from the train) which seems like a miracle because if the engineering is run like the customer service (and let\u2019s face it the train and line maintenance is not even visible so it could be worse) God help us all.\n\nNever again. I will take my chances with Easyjet. I\u2019m sure they will be appalling too, but it will cost half as much.",

This makes me reluctant to book any future journeys as i would be concerned if I needed to make amendments. This is a lot of money to risk. I too tried customer service only to be told that they are only taking calls for bookings and to go to their website. I filled in the required email form and have received no reply. No way am I booking any further trips if I cannot communicate with the company involved. I have just emailed the CEO as it seems customer services is not available.

As if travel is not already stressful enough, given the airlines cancelling flights, rail strikes, baggage problems, etc, etc, be very wary of booking with Eurostar, specially if you choose a particular Outbound date and then due to unseen circumstances have to change that Outbound date, whereas the Inbound dates remain unchanged.\n\nThey will screw you and charge twice, keeping the original booking costs of \u00a3000s, and then re-charging all over again, whereas Trainline alters the new booking dates and charges a small adjustment, for connecting trains to Kings Cross rather than like Eurostar pocketing the entire original Booking, maybe for some summer staff knees-up !\n\nI paid \u00a3173 for travel to Amsterdam but had to re-book due to unseen circumstances. I got charged a whopping further \u00a3185 for the re-arranged Outbound date only. Trying to call them is a sheer waste of time as they hide behind that chestnut, \u2019all our agents are\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019(what, at 8am??). And trying to reach them by email is another total waste of time.\n\nAvoid changing dates with Eurostar like a plague or they will rip customers off !! Last time I ever travel Eurostar",

Phoning is also impossible as you can\u2019t get through whatever time of day you try. I have also filled out their complaint form three times, emailed them directly and tweeted but still no reply as yet. I booked with confidence, buying expensive tickets on the premise that the dates could easily be changed, which I believe is false advertising as it was very easy to book and take payment, but impossible for me to make any changes. Now, after today, my tickets will be within 7 days and accordingly to their terms and conditions should incur a fee which I will not pay as it is not my fault that their system is faulty. I don\u2019t know what to do or who to contact now to get this resolved. The experience has been very frustrating, stressful and upsetting.

I contacted Eurostar by Twitter as phones always busy and on 8th June was told Eurostar services unaffected.  On 12th June I discovered you could not book Eurostar for evening journeys on the RMT strike days.  Twitter messages three days running requesting clarification not replied to.  On 15th June I finally managed to speak on the phone after trying all day and being on hold over an hour and was told strikes having no impact.  Next day I get an email telling me how to prepare for my trip and then a text advising my return journey could not be guaranteed. Finally, later that evening Eurostar put the first message on their website.  Today I learnt a general strike in Belgium was announced on 14th to take place on 20th June, again there is no information on the Eurostar website.  Eurostar obviously cannot control strikes but they do control their website, their phone service and their social media accounts.  The response and flow of information has been woeful to the point of non-existance.  I don\u2019t really think they are competent to run international train services.",

With a monumental queue and getting very close to missing the train we (and lots of others around us) interacted with the staff a lot. To a man (or woman) they were polite, professional, knowledgable and reassuring. A credit to Eurostar. \n\nGoing through passport control, with just minutes to go to our train and the French passport officers being particularly officious, I queried to one staff \u201c will we make the 11:04?\u201d To which I got the reply in a reassuring but friendly voice \u201c we leave no-one behind\u201d\u2026.

All that time was spent in a huge queue and I managed to board my train only because there was a 50 min delay. Not enough passport control points and overcrowded lounge. Obviously, as people arrive long before their departure. On my way back some trains were cancelled due to power supply disruption in Paris. I only received an SMS advising me not to travel that day. I had to, due to work commitments. Spent the entire day monitoring their site that didn\u2019t provide much information regarding estimated delays for trains that were not cancelled. Eventually boarded my train that was delayed approx 2h30 minutes. Got a voucher as compensation, but I don\u2019t know what makes them think I\u2019d want to use their service again? It\u2019s definitely cheaper to fly and the hassle (arrive at certain time before departure, long queues etc) is exactly the same as when flying. I must say that the staff was polite but they did not have much information either. Awful communication from Eurostar.",

        "review_text": "I have had the worst possible experience at euro star \u2018business premier\u2019 train from paris to London, I would like to name Binca which is by far the worst possible staff I have ever witnessed from the first look as soon as I boarded she constantly gave me unpleasant and unwelcoming attitude and looks throughout my time on the train whenever I asked a simple question as to where my seat was she was aggressive and unhelpful. when I asked for vegetarian/halal options she said there was no options and you would have to book in advance when I asked a different staff member he said vegetarian options are available. she served all the other passengers before me and my friend, the last straw was when my friend was waiting for a drink for 15 minutes I tried to avoid her but was left with no option but to ask her for a drink and she said in the rudest way possible \u201cSAY PLEASE\u201d I refused as it was not a kind request I didn\u2019t believe it felt right, in her head it was a power play so I refused she started shouting a lot of different things like you are not getting your drink in a very childish way I then asked for the manager. Now the manager which his name was Mansour, before even approaching me spoke to her first and then other guests in and around our area most of it was in French which they probably realised I did not understand, then came to me in a very unfriendly way he requested I get up and follow him to the front of the train which was very embarrassing as it felt like a I had done something wrong and made me look bad in front of the other passengers. The way he was speaking it felt like he had already written me off and was not listening to my side at all. As the train was coming to the destination I practically gave up as the manager had taken her side she constantly walked past me with again unpleasant looks at that point I realised no disciplinary actions would be taken this route and decided to leave it. I would be very surprised if I EVER book the euro star again definitely not paying the extra for business premier as you would expect better service for the money you spend.",

        "review_text": "Eurostar was fine but we discovered there was a national train and bus strike in Belgium on 31st May - the day we were travelling back from Spa to the UK. We bought the train ticket as part of the Eurostar ticket. It would have been good if Eurostar had let us know as we could have changed our plans and stayed the last night in Brussels. There were no buses provided by Belgian railways to replace the trains. You were supposed to use local buses but not all were running and there seemed no way of knowing which bus would come. It was so stressful. We got up at 5am and were waiting for buses that didn't come wondering if we would make it back in time for the Eurostar train. Not speaking the language and there not being anyone at the stations to ask. We followed the suggested routes and buses on the SNCB website but buses didn't come. The info kept changing too. Desperate we got a bus to Liege and were trundling our suitcases trying to find the station or tourist info. Found there were no buses or trains we could get. Kindly staff in a cafe rang a taxi for us. Spent \u00a364 euros to get to next town hoping bus would arrive there to take us to St Truin train station. Waited 3 hours for bus in the heat. Two of the buses due to come didn't come. From 5am to 2.45pm only ate a banana we had with us as too stressed to eat and didn't dare risk wasting time/missing bus. Finally got train back to Brussels but it was horrendous and has put me off travelling by train in Europe. We felt left adrift with no help.",

Still, I have all the legal documents that allow me to travel and the website clearly says that I can go without a visa if it is for less than 90 days, which was the case. They also said that I can travel by plane but not train!!!!!!!!! This horrible experience has caused me emtional and financial damage accompanied by huge distress. Obviously, no one knows what the rules are and it seems that many laws and legal rights are getting violated because of their carelessness and ignorance. Moreover, no one has explained why this happened!",

        "review_text": "I will be avoiding travelling from Paris to London on the Eurostar if I can. To begin with there were no clear signs as to which line was for which train, which there was from London to Paris. The staff were generally rude and dismissive, and the difference a particular lady treated standard versus business premier passengers would be hilarious if it wasn't shocking. I understand business premier pay more, but it shouldn't be \"bonjour Madame/Monsieur\" smiley smiley and polite, and on the other hand shouting at people to get there passports ready and physically stopping them if they don't. What are we boarding the Titanic??\nOur train was delayed due to electrical failures, fine they can't control that. But there was NO explanation as to why from the staff and we were left standing there dumbfounded for hours. When a lady asked when we would be boarding, she was completely ignored. Finally they changed our tickets to an earlier train (still massively delayed), but it wasn't clear as to why we were getting our tickets changed and to what train. When I panicked a bit (I think understandably), she LAUGHED at me and shook her head. Appalling behaviour and the staff should be ashamed of themselves for the way they \"handled\" the situation. I understand you can't control technical issues, but for the love of God there should be some contingency plan that doesn't include being flippant and extremely rude to people who have PAYED to board your service. I can only give two stars because the London to Paris side was very well organised and the staff were very polite and lovely.",

        "review_text": "The Eurostar trains are comfortable, there is plenty of room to stow luggage and there are even sockets available (both EU and UK sockets) to charge your mobile devices. Wifi is available, but, as on most trains, relies on 3G technology and is therefore unbearably slow and for all practical purposes inadequate. But that is not unique for Eurostar. \n\nWhere it all falls apart for Eurostar is customer experience. Especially when it comes to informing passengers about delays and logistic handling at both ends (Amsterdam and London in my case). I expected queues for security and customs, but not at the magnitude encountered. At the Amsterdam end it took approximately one hour to clear check-in, security and customs. During this wait, there is no indication whatsoever whether you are in the right queue (for what destination). Passengers are completely exposed to the elements while waiting so I was lucky it was a sunny day. Had to wait for thirty minutes in a cramped waiting room, too small for the amount of passengers that fit in one train. Without any announcement a set of doors opened an a certain point and, while staff was there, passengers were left up to their own devices to figure out what would happen next. \n\nAt the London end, things were pretty much the same, save that the queue was completely inside this time. Due to weather conditions, some trains were canceled and others delayed. Eurostar couldn't be bothered to inform their passengers about the current situation and where to go. Their app simply stated that all was well; this led to long lines for the info desk as it was fairly obvious that all was not well. Eurostar could have so easily prevented this by providing information through their mobile app. \nThere were several lines for the various cancelled/delayed trains, but it was completely unclear which line to join, if any. The staff was extremely rude to passengers being in the wrong line and ushered them out of it in a rude manner. Eventually, and unannounced neither by app, displays or spoken, an employee opened a line for my train. The indicated destination was incorrect, but I happened to be close by and noticed it. No other option but to queue and wait for what's coming. After another exorbitant long wait I managed to clear the check in and security. All of it was inefficient and chaotic. Customs were cleared easily, only to arrive in an overcrowded and therefore throughly unpleasant departure hall. No seats available (I was accustomed to that meanwhile) so nothing do to but wait around for what would happen (tunnel was closed due to bad weather). At the time the gates should open to board the train, there was an announcement that service through  the tunnel was suspended for an unknown amount of time. Or, at least, that's what I understood as the speaker volume was low and the message not repeated for clarity. Meanwhile, passengers having cleared customs kept streaming in leading to even more cramped conditions. Their app provided no information and staff shone through their absence. The queue for the info desk had grown to impressive proportions as Eurostar again couldn't be bothered to use their various digital platforms to provide information. \nThe delay turned out to be just 30 minutes; had they not kept the suspense by providing information, the wait would have been less stressful. Boarding was fast and the train left. But the journey wasn't over just yet...\nBy the time we reached Brussels we had caught up on the delay by ten minutes. But we had to wait for a crew change for a whopping 50 minutes which increased the train delay to about 75 minutes. A single muffled announcement was the only info provided, and the passengers where left to stew for the duration. Suprisingly, things changed for the better with the new crew; no more muffled announcements, but a crisp female voice that not only provided information on connecting trains, but also repeat the messages in case they were completely heard the first time! More staff like her, please, Eurostar! Sadly, with the 75 minute delay we arrived at Amsterdam late at night - the staff promised the passengers to go coach-by-coach to discuss travelling options that late, but that promise wasn't kept (I was in the last coach, so maybe they didn't make it that far before Amsterdam).\n\nSo all of it left a bitter sweet experience; the train can be a viable alternative to airplanes (the train is comfortable), but not like the way Eurostar implemented it... This leaves me to conclude pretty much the same as most other reviewers: Eurostar, work on your provided (and currently nearly absent) customer exprience!! Starting with adequate information provision; you have an excellent app so there is no excuse not to do that.",

        "review_text": "Daar zit je dan. Volkomen verbijsterd op een bankje naast het treinstation. \n\nNet als velen anderen mocht ik vandaag niet de Eurostar in. Reden: ik stond ruim op tijd (45\u2019) op het perron te wachten, maar had het hokje waar je door de controle moet niet gezien. Daar was ook niemand aanwezig aangezien de check-in een uur voor vertrek sluit. \n\nHet argument van Eurostar dat we de website hadden kunnen lezen is ongetwijfeld correct, maar we hebben het hier over iets dat verder gaat dan regeltjes. Er zijn op 1 avond meer dan 15 mensen geweigerd om in te stappen, terwijl het Eurostar personeel gewoon aanwezig was maar zich afsloot in hun kantoortje. Er stonden naast mij allemaal reizigers die heel bewust de trein wilden  nemen in plaats van het vliegtuig en iedereen was op tijd aanwezig op het treinstation. Eurostar doet echter niets om klanten te helpen, maar lijkt bewust de boel te frustreren en kleineert haar klanten. \n\nNadat de trein vertrokken was en het personeel ineens verscheen - mensen die ons ook hadden kunnen inchecken - was de houding vijandig en onbeschoft. \n\nIk geef dit bedrijf 1 ster en hoop dat men aan de slag gaat met het verbeteren van 1) communicatie, 2) aanwijzingen op vertreklocaties en 3) klantvriendelijkheid. \n\nTot ik reviews zie die deze verbetering aangeven kies ik voor ander vervoer, en ik raad allen die dit lezen aan hetzelfde te doen.",

The train from London was on time until it stopped just outside Paris Gare du Nord and apparently wouldn't restart.  The wait and delay was 90 minutes.  I was travelling across Europe so missed all my connections, eventually arriving at my destination four hours late. On my return I received an email offering me (modest) compensation for the delay. However, my registration for the compensation was not recognised.  I tried to call Eurostar but gave up after an hour of holding.  I sent three emails over the space of a month asking for support and an explanation.  I have received no response of any kind.  I love the principle of Eurostar - train travel to France and into Europe in a way which is far greener than flying.  But Eurostar has a monopoly which plainly permits it to offer absolutely no customer service.  A very frustrating and unsatisfactory experience.",

Tot onze afschuw zagen we vervolgens de reacties op internet dat dit continue gebeurt en Eurostar hier klaarblijkelijk totaal lak heeft. Er is dus 0.0 intentie om de communicatie in dit kader te verbeteren. Tot slot moet je, voor je de trein in kunt, langs een uitgebreide paspoort en baggage controle waardoor het in feite net een vliegveld is. Het hele idee dat het dus 'veel efficienter' is dan vliegen, klopt helaas echt niet!",

I tried on several occasions to cancel my train ticket since travel was impossible through no fault of my own. The Italian and French train companies allowed me to cancel. Eurostar ignored all requests to cancel and didn't allow me to do so on their website. They have never replied and I still do not have my refund. I am now in the process of making a formal complaint to the regulator since my complaint to Eurostar has not been answered. \n\nThat they own this monopoly is bad enough, but that they take advantage of people like this is the worst part.",

Whilst the actual experience of the train was very nice, we found that in the lead up to our trip they changed our train times a couple of times, and then on our last night in Paris they cancelled our train (booked for first thing the next morning) with absolutely no new train or information on what to do. We ended up spending our last night trying to talk to Eurostar staff at the train station, who were friendly, but just told us that all we could do was turn up the next day and wait to get on the next available train, which didn't feel like a very secure option. We did manage to get the train back, but we just felt like it was generally chaotic. We returned many hours after our original booking, and we filled in their compensation form and months later we still haven't had a response. Plus, we booked our covid travel tests through their recommended retailers because they said we'd get a discount for being Eurostar customers, but it turns out you just pay the standard price. Generally unimpressed.",

We have sent you over an e-voucher with a value of \u00a3... which will expire in (...). We look forward to seeing you again soon. Please do not hesitate to get in contact if you have any further enquiries.\n\nMy previous comments (rating 1):\nI have never used Eurostar before but booked a ticket in Sept 2020. Due to restrictions at that time, Eurostar gave a voucher to be used before 31rst Dec 2021. I booked my ticket for beginning of Dec (for which I paid an extra) but with new travel restrictions again in place, once more, I couldn't travel. I tried to contact Eurostar over the phone every day for more that 7 days and never got hold onto someone from their customer service. I also tried several time a day for more that 7 days to postpone my ticket but every single time, I couldn't pay the extra price for a new ticket. At the end, before my supposed travel date (10th Dec), I sent an email to Eurostar asking not for a refund but for a new voucher. Shockingly, I received this answer on the 16th Dec (3 days after my supposed return from France):\n \"Dear Customer,\nThank you for contacting us and our sincere apologies for the delay in getting back to you. We have seen an influx of contacts coming our way which has impacted our response times.\nWe\u2019re getting in touch as we see that you contacted us regarding a reservation for which the travel date has now passed. We hope that you had a pleasant journey and apologise that we have not been able to get back to you in time.\nPlease do let us know if further assistance is required by clicking the button below. There is no need to resubmit your question as your existing case will be passed on to one of our team who will gladly assist you further.\"\n\nShame on Eurostar!!! They have NO customer service and they are mocking their clients. Obviously, I pressed the button and am still waiting for a proper answer on their incompetence.",

When you call them you have to listen to literally 6 minutes of useless robot information, and then the call hangs up! And there's nothing you can do to get through. Infuriating. Infuriating each and every time. And they KNOW it, otherwise they wouldn't put 6 minutes of information without a way to skip. \n\nOh, and prevously when I had an issue b/c of their website not working properly and double-charging two bookings instead of one, I had to wait 45 minutes on the line to get that resolved. They tell you they are very busy due to covid, but guess what you could avoid a lot of these customer calls just by making your website work properly \u2013 which hasn't improved in months and still buggy every time. Folks, here's a tip, it's 2021 and your website is THE face of your brand, not the train rides themselves! We're gonna take the trains anyways due to you being the only train service between countries, but your website is what makes the difference between 1 and 5 star experience.",

The cost to reschedule the train was more expensive than the ticket itself! Which I think is ridiculous and extortionate. Not only that, but I was told to wait for over an hour at 7am just to be told why I was not allowed to travel ,even though it was just a lack of one form which I already understood. I was not told anything and was stuck sat in a small chair alone next to boarder control while being upset at the fact that I could not be able to see my family I was travelling to see. The point of the Eurostar was to create a more Eco-friendly, fast, convenient and accessible way to travel from the UK to France and I think that it has failed in every way here as the only reason I wanted to travel by train was to be more Eco-conscious.

The day before we were due to return to the UK we got an email from Eurostar cancelling our early morning train from Brussels-Midi due to operational difficulties. We rebooked on a later train that day without any difficulty but our onward travel tickets from Kings Cross to Leeds ( which we paid \u00a325 for) were no longer valid and our new connection tickets were \u00a3165.\nWe claimed the difference from Eurostar and they re-imbursed us, without fuss, within 2 working days.\nBecause of their prompt and professional action they have retained our custom. When things go wrong it is how they are put right that is a true measure of a company. Thank you Eurostar.",

But instead of making it easy to get a refund through their website (as is a customer right under their T&Cs), they have made it impossible to do anything. No response by email after several attempts. No response on Twitter. Contact number does not work. I even begrudgingly went onto the website to move the dates only to find there were no available dates in August and September. It's ridiculous. \n\nI am now just 2 weeks from the planned trip (which can't happen anyway under restrictions) and nervous that I will get no refund.\n\nSort it out Eurostar. This is criminal!",

        "review_text": "I have had issues with 2 vouchers expiring on 31 December. When trying to book online this past month, they appear as \"already used\" on the website  (which cannot be, since I haven't travelled with Eurostar in 14 months). \nI have tried calling (answering machine), went to St Pancras but officers on-site say they can't help as they don't have access to customers' profiles, and sent an email more than 28 days ago (aka their expected reply deadline) but still haven't had a reply. \nI was relieved in a sense to read that it is a general issue travellers are experiencing at the moment with Eurostar's customer service. \nIt's no secret that times are hard for most companies and I just wish there was more transparency about what is truly going on.  It is also new for me to have such a bad experience with the company. Travelling with Eurostar used to be such a treat, and I hope it will be again at some point.\nUPDATE: I did manage to talk to someone mid-December who was very patient, helpful and kind. My trips with Eurostar have been enjoyable again since. So, as I foresaw in my review, Eurostar probably went through a bit of a rough patch and are now coming back to their customer service excellence. Sweet!",

Finally managed to get through to someone after 1 day of trying, only to be told he couldn't help and I should 'maybe try booking without the voucher, and use the voucher another time' or to call back again to speak to someone else. Why couldn't he transfer me himself?! Now after 10 times of attempting to call again and receiving the pre-recorded message saying they're too busy and disconnecting the call, I've been sat on hold for 3 hours waiting to speak to someone.\nAlso, don't bother trying to speak to them on Twitter/Facebook as they just ignore you.",

A few days before I was due to travel I sent an email indicating that I was suffering from Covid 19 related symptoms and was following Eurostar's instructions not to travel. I received an automated response advising that my email had been received and that I should not try to contact anyone as it was very busy and that someone would get back to me in the following week/s. My return train was then cancelled, and I was offered a link to claim a voucher, which never worked. Since then I have emailed about 10 times over the course of the past 20 months, receiving only a few vague responses, with some assurance that I am entitled to a voucher, as the dates of my trip fall in the correct time window. The most recent response dates back to 6/9/2021 when someone from the customer service finally answered they had requested my voucher and that I would be contacted in the next few days. Needless to say, I haven't been contacted to date, despite my writing to the customer service once again on 25/10/2021. Recently my partner, who I was meant to travel with, received an email advising of a time limit of December 2021 to use their e-vouchers. I still have not received vouchers for my cancelled train. I am going to update this daily until someone contacts me. It is extremely unfair that no-one returns my email, especially after so long and several attempts at communication from my side. I will be writing to the Ombudsman if nothing is done to rectify this.",

        "review_text": "On 5 November, I used Eurostar's services for the first time, travelling from London back to Germany. It explicitly says on the ticket to get to St. Pancras International 120 minutes before departure, because of intensified checks related to Brexit and Covid. I arrived on time and went through the checks in less than 30 minutes. Apparently, other travelers didn't consider the extra time and arrived too late. Instead of Eurostar considering it these people's responsibility to be on time, we *waited* for all guests to pass the checks, resulting in a 19 minute delayed departure and a 27 delayed arrival in Brussels. A whole group of people, myself included, missed the connecting ICE to Cologne/Frankfurt - it was announced that the ICE would wait for us, but this turned out to be untrue. Why does Eurostar reward latecomers, thereby causing problems for people who have to travel farther? At least Eurostar booked me a hotel room in Brussels, as there were no more available connecting trains that day.",

In the meanwhile the cost for the trip has increased to 194 euro. There's no help offered to rebook my trip. Stunningly, I also have to pay the increase in price. The agent says it is my fault because I didn't call earlier. But haven't I made all my obligations as a constumer by paying? Right now Eurostar makes 106 euro extra on my trip.

And it was.\nNL exit process was painless and then the UK passport control, just steps after the Dutch one, was quiet, queue-free and quick to clear (i am non-EU/non-UK passport holder).\nThe train journey was long but Wi-Fi worked well, strong enough to allow me to watch a few episodes on Netflix with little break to the signal.\nFood was fine, toilets were cleaned regularly, announcements were plentiful.\nArrival into St Pancras was on time and painless. There is a border force gate you have to pass through (not sure why) although no officers standing. After that is the UK Customs and there were a few officers standing pulling travelers on the side for questioning and X-ray of their carryons.\n\nOK I took off a star for:\n- rude X-ray agent at Rotterdam (I mean she was aggressively rude)\n- The departure lounge at RTM was small and windows wouldn\u2019t open. No shops or cafes just one vending machine so make sure to buy all you need before you enter the Eurostar building (the ticket check counter)\n- The seat itself is poorly padded (so my bottom and lower back started to get uncomfortable just past the hallway point to London)\n- inflexible website: i wanted to change my departure point (from Rotterdam to Amsterdam) but the online booking portal wouldn\u2019t do it. So i called and it took me over 45 min to reach an agent and I was told changing origin/destinations is not an option with them. Shame. Airlines excel on this point.\n\nI\u2019d travel with Eurostar again if given a chance so don\u2019t listen too much to all the 1 star reviews. It really isnt THAT bad.",

I ended it up having 2 seats booked, as it was too late to cancel. \nI have then decided to leave my coat and my bag on the empty one and travel comfortable. A lady from the staff came to me and asked to remove my belongings from the other seat as someone else could take it, I showed her my ticket, a clear reservation for 2 people, but she insisted that it could have been used by someone else, I politely disagreed explaining that it was paid by me, so it was not free for someone else to use, she then left saying that it was ok. \nOne minute later, a lady asked me to remove my stuff to allow her to sit down there, I didn't want to argue again so I just took my coat off the seat, but I then asked her the reason why she was seating in there, wondering if that space was maybe mistakenly double booked. She smiled and said the staff member sent her to seat in there, I was under the impression that they were friends! OK this is only my impression, but at the end of the trip the lady went to thank the staff member, who knows why, maybe for the free dinner?! \n\nI  think this behaviour is very unprofessional!\n\nA part from this, the journey was very pleasant, the train is very comfortable and fast.  I would definitely recommend Eurostar and I hope to travel again with them soon, hoping I won't come across the wrong staff member again.",

        "title": "Een samenvatting: waarom reizen met Eurostar kansloos is.",
        "review_text": "ALLE reviews die u hier leest, komen volledig overeen met hoe reizen met Eurostar vandaag de dag is. \n\nBijvoorbeeld, de klantenservice is inderdaad compleet onbereikbaar. Iemand heeft de moeite genomen om nog even in te spreken dat het door de COVID drukker is dan normaal en daarna hebben ze het licht uit gedaan op de afdeling. We wilden herhaaldeijk een ticket laten wijzigen, maar dat is niet gelukt door die onbereikbaarheid van de klantenservice. Gek is dat telkens ook de verbindingen worden verbroken, er wordt gemeld dat er niemand in de gekozen taal beschikbaar is of na enige tijd in de wacht, alsnog de lijn stopt. En doe vooral geen moeite om per mail contact te zoeken. Want de \u201cbeloofde\u201d 7 dagen, zijn as we speak al 32 dagen geleden verstreken. \n\nDe procedures aan de grens zijn een giftige cocktail van 2 factoren. Factor 1 is een monopolistisch bedrijf dat zonder enige concurrentie zijn functies uitoefent. Niemand is dus ge\u00efnteresseerd in het soepel afwikkelen van het inchecken. Typerend is de chaotische situatie van het inchecken op Londen. Alsof ze het elke keer voor het eerst doen. We hebben ons zeer verbaasd op 24 oktober. Rijen door elkaar. Schreeuwende staff en routes die elke 10 seconden met trekkoorden gewijzigd worden. Een Indiaas vliegveld is overzichtelijker. \n\nFactor 2 is de complete desinteresse van beide grenssystemen van Groot Brittanni\u00eb en de EU om de paspoortcontrole goed te regelen. 2 douaniers op 2 volle treinen. Alles straalt hier uit dat beide grootmachten hun uiterste best doen om zo min mogelijk energie te steken in de paspoortcontrole, omdat de ander vooral niet de indruk moet krijgen belangrijk te zijn. Dat dit politieke spel gespeeld wordt over de rug van de reiziger, is niet alleen triest, maar ook typerend voor hoe dom het is als je elkaar als grootmacht de rug toekeert. Het lijkt wel alsof we weer 50 jaar teruggeworpen zijn in de tijd. \n\nEn tot slot de reis zelf. Het idee dat de iets langere treinreis wordt gecompenseerd door het niet-hoeven-wachten op vliegvelden is een fabel. Alleen de nachtferry duurt vandaag de dag langer dan reizen met Eurostar tussen Londen en Rotterdam. Voorbeeld: wie op zondag om 11:04 de Eurostar uit Londen neemt, moet volgens Eurostar al om 9u op het station zijn. En is pas om 16u:30u in Rotterdam. In die tijd kan je met het vliegtuig ver voorbij de evenaar zijn, incluus check-in. Waar zit die lange reistijd nog meer in? In verborgen buffer-tijd in de dienstregeling. Omdat Belgi\u00eb qua spoor ook nog in de 19e eeuw zit en omdat elk land de Eurostar liever achteraan laat aansluiten (eigen trein eerst, al is het een stoptrein), rijdt de trein bijna nergens op topsnelheid, als\u2019ie op tijd is. Sterker nog; in bijvoorbeeld Brussel sta je nog dik een half uur stil. Is de Eurostar eenmaal een paar minuten vertraagd? Dan heb je pech en voeg je overal achteraan in. Achter de autotrein in de Kanaaltunnel, achter de TER van Calais naar Frethun, achter de L-trein naar Mechelen en achter de sprinter naar Lombardijen. \n\nIs er dan niets positief? Jawel. De Britse omroepers zijn altijd en overal duidelijk hoorbaar en zoals Britten betaamt, is alles \u201cplease\u201d en \u201cexcuse me\u201d. Dus aan beleefdheid gelukkig geen gebrek. \n\nMensen, duurzaam en snel reizen is mijlen ver weg. Alle goede intenties ten spijt; het was een leuk streven. Maar het blijkt kansloos onhaalbare hobby die genadeloos de nek wordt omgedraaid door gemakzucht, arrogantie, winstbejag en desinteresse. Maar ze hebben het gelukkig wel geprobeerd.",

Ze reageren alleen op openbare tweets, vragen je vervolgens te reageren in een DM en negeren je vervolgens daar. DRAMA\n\nUPDATE 2: Na meerdere tweets en DMS heeft er iemand 'de manager' aan de jas getrokken en die heeft ene Ria op de case gezet. Dan verwacht je dat als de manager Ria op de zaak zet, Ria wel weet hoe je dit moet oplossen. Helaas blijkt Ria niet zo goed te kunnen lezen, alles door elkaar te halen en wanneer je alle informatie nog eens stuurt je weer een week te negeren.

With Eurostar we booked directly as it obviously goes straight into DLP, which was perfect.\n\nUntil a month later after booking I get an email from Eurostar to say our direct train had been cancelled, and we now had to get there using the RER.\nI have basically paid \u00a3300+ for a direct service I am not getting, paid more for direct so we didn't have the hassle of changing trains. NOWHERE have I been offered a reduced price. They seem to think that the fact they have covered the \u20ac7.60 per adult is enough to justify it. I don't think so as I am not getting the service I paid for.\n\nNot only that, my out going time is now 10 minutes later, and our return time an hour earlier. So, now thanks to having to mess about with changing trains, we now loose time in the parks (they are not cheap either) Also, because of the return train home, we have to leave even EARLIER due to it being a Sunday and the journey time doubles back to Paris.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever booked with Eurostar, and I am honestly so put off with ever booking with them again. Customer service is non existent, and their answer is to just cancel. I can't cancel as I have literally paid out for the hotel & park so I will loose money. They do not care in the slightest.\n\nNext time I will just fly, and save myself the agro of using such an arrogant service.",

        "review_text": "Totale Blamage reizen met Eurostar! \n\nWat belachelijk het inchecken bij Eurostar. Op de bevestingsmail is aangegeven dat je tussen de 90-30 minuten van te voren aanwezig moet zijn, zodat de checks soepel verlopen vanwege Brexit en corona. Nou ik was daar dus 30 minuten van te voren, om vervolgens te horen dat de checks dicht zijn en je niet mee kan gaan met de trein. Want blijkbaar staat de douane daar om je koffer te checken, en je paspoort en al je corona documenten. Alsof je op het vliegveld staat. Dat was totale nieuws voor mij?! In de mails en op de website staat er helemaal niks hierover over. En ook niks vermeld dat als je niet 30 minuten van te voren aanwezig bent je mooi kan fluiten naar je reis. De bewaking kan slechts zielig met je meekijken hoe je 30 minuten achter een glas staat te smeken of je binnen mag komen, terwijl de trein het station komt inrijden. Je kan de trein letterlijk aanraken, maar niet toegelaten worden in de trein.  Daar gaat dan je ticket van \u20ac133,- heen! \nDe volgende trein vertrekt pas de volgende dag of je kan naar Brussel gaan, maar dan moet je wel \u20ac250 euro extra bij betalen! Wat een onzin! Als Eurostar je zo slecht informeert over de procedure op het perron! Daar stond ik dan met 10 andere reizigers, zonder enige opties om nog die avond in Londen te komen. De volgende dag als enige optie, maar met een retourticket voor de dag erna. Dus kon ik slechts 1 nacht in Londen zijn om de volgende ochtend de trein weer naar huis te pakken. Er waren geen opties, omboeken was de enige mogelijkheid. Maar met deze last-minute prijzen, van 200- 400 euro, totaal onmogelijk om weer thuis te komen. Ik vind het rond uit belachelijk dat de procedures, de douane en check-ins niet duidelijk zijn benoemd op de site en op de bevestigingsmails. Je wordt alleen maar plat gegooid met corona info wat je allemaal moet doen, maar dit vergeten ze voor het gemak even te melden. Ik ga nooit meer met Eurostar reizen.",

Rebook Paris for two Nov 2021; when applying e-voucher at checkout, error code says, \u2018Sorry we can\u2019t complete your checkout\u2019 and provides phone number. Eurostar offices closed over weekend so send email, get auto response. Try first thing Monday morning. Sit on hold 1 hr 25 min before I have to go. Try again, on hold 45 min, phone connects, person on other line disconnects. Go through entire directory of options - each one disconnecting except finally, one for disability. After 45 min, agent named Linda picks up, stops me after five words, says if it\u2019s not about disability, she can\u2019t help and without listening to my query, promptly reroutes me back into queue, where I sit for another 25 min before I have to go. Finally decide to book Paris for two using credit card (will deal with e-voucher later). At checkout, error code says, \u2018Sorry we cant complete your checkout\u2019 with same number listed. Try another credit card. Same deal. Partner tries to log in, clicks \u2018forgot password,\u2019 sitting waiting for password reset email to come through, still waiting.",

Aangezien mijn tickets vanwege het pakketaspect niet te annuleren zijn hoopte ik op overleg om te bespreken of er toch niet iets te regelen is, wellicht een voucher. Net als de anderen heb ik de ervaring dat het onmogelijk is telefonisch in contact te komen met Eurostar en ook op emails reageren  ze domweg niet. Ook niet op een aangetekende brief.

Helaas is het nooit tot een E-voucher gekomen, gezien ik vandaag op mijn account mijn reis weer zie staan.

        "review_text": "This review is just a message to eurostar about their WiFi. Outside of this, the train is actually a relatively good service.\n\nThe WiFi: I've been on eurostar many many times, over the last years and never has the WiFi worked. Not on my many phones, not on my laptops. Why is it so hard to arrange WiFi on the train? All trains in Netherlands have WiFi, even most busses in Netherlands have WiFi! An international and relatively expensive service like eurostar should offer proper WiFi! You need to be able to work on such long trips, otherwise business people will remain using airplanes. Mobile network doesn't always cover you during the trip, and is often disrupted. Please, eurostar, pull yourself together and get this sorted. It's 2021 and not having WiFi is unacceptable. Get it done.",

The representatives from Eurostar made me miss my train saying that I needed to first pay for the UK vaccines from their government. It took 2 hours to complete the online process and 400 pounds!! So once I did that the Eurostar agent confirmed that me and my fianc\u00e9 were going to be able to board the train. Then once we get past the French police, we then get past the UK police and finally ONE MORE station to get to (mind you this was taking the 5pm train and waiting 4 hours past our original try at this) the UK border agent tells us that we are not allowed in the UK because although we are American we can\u2019t come in through France. He threw my Covid vaccine cards and negative test results at me and called another agent to a hold cell where we waited two more hours (missing the next bus) and then finally we were escorted BACK to the French side of the station and told we were out of luck. \n\n\nAfter explaining all this to the Eurostar agent she told me that the tickets were \u201cunrefundable\u201d and didn\u2019t seem to care much about my situation. Honestly, the WORST experience and now I despise the UK and vow never to take the Eurostar ever. This company only cares about your money. They dont value you as a customer.\n\nThe most they will do is give you another date to travel which does me no good since I will never go back to Europe after this horrible treatment.",

I sent an email via the contact page which says someone will aim to get back within 7days. 13 days later and no reply. I understand there are delays 'because of covid', but if that is the case then they need to be changing their holding emails to reflect this. \n\nHaving spoken to one of their customer service team just now, they say the compensation refund is lower than what I was expecting as the cost of that return travel leg was (conveniently) very cheap. \nNo where does it state the individual leg/ticket prices on my invoice, so as far as I am concerned this figure could be plucked out of the air to save them money.\n\nIf you're not going to be transparent on your invoices, then be fair and refund based on an assumed ticket price being 50/50 of the total return cost. \n\nMy case has been left open for one of their team members to review further- will update with the outcome.",

        "review_text": "Het leek ons leuk om een keer met de trein naar London te gaan i.p.v. vliegen. Door de corona pandemie en de regels in de UK was het niet mogelijk om te reizen. Na een keer verschuiven met de datum, nieuwe tickets (waarbij er wel bijbetaald moest worden, want duurdere tickets). Nu er weer een verschuiving nodig is, is het niet mogelijk om 1 van de 3 tickets te annuleren of zelfs los te koppelen van de andere 2. Om persoonlijke redenen is het 3e ticket nu na al die tijd niet meer nodig. Het geld hiervan is niet terug te krijgen, maar het is ook niet mogelijk deze los te koppelen van de andere 2 waardoor er dus alleen een voucher van 3e tickets gegeven wil worden. Ook moeten we zelf de voucher maar gaan regelen bij Eurostar, dit terwijl we de tickets besteld hebben bij de NS.\n\nHet komt er dus op neer dat we 300euro gespendeerd hebben voor vouchers welke we nooit kunnen en zullen gaan gebruiken, of in ieder geval 100euro verlies als we wel binnen de voucher termijn gaan reizen omdat het 3e ticket verloren is.\n\nMijn advies: Reis nooit, maar dan ook nooit met de NS naar London. Stap over de schaamte en stap in het vliegtuig. Dat is goedkoper, sneller en levert minder stress op",

Ik houd niet zo van vliegen, wil ook milieubewuster bezig zijn met reizen en dit kwam goed uit omdat je van het midden van de ene stad uitkomt in het midden van een andere stad.\n\nAlle slechte reviews over Eurostar in coronatijd zijn waar. Ik heb echt geen probleem met vouchers (ondanks ik het gigantisch storend vond hoe moeilijk er werd gedaan over geld terug krijgen, er wordt gezegd dat dit niet kan, volgens mij mag dit helemaal niet), maar als deze dan niet verlengd kunnen worden naar een tijd die uitkomt zonder enige andere opties naast je geld gewoon verliezen, ben ik er een beetje klaar mee. Contact maken duurt gigantisch lang en is telefonisch bijna onmogelijk. Het zou toch niet zo moeilijk zijn om de duur van een voucher te verlengen?\n\nIk had graag met de trein gereisd en het zou perfect uitkomen voor het bezoeken van een festival in de buurt van London, maar hoe er met klanten om wordt gegaan vind ik belachelijk. \n\nIn conclusie: Vooral heel erg teleurstellend.",

As I had not noticed that  Iwould need to buy a  separate ticket for my instrument (which could fit easily standing next to me sharing my seat without) I had to buy one.  I had arrived with 2 hours to spare so this should have been possible.   However, I faced I wall of ineptitude, unhelpfulness, lack of training, as unsympathetic, unskilled staff were sending me from office to office across a large building (my carrying weight was no issue to them if they could avoid lifting a finger). I faced a large number of contradicting statements, prices, and procedure.  The 2 hours twindled down to minutes before departure and with no ticket in sight, instead Eurostar employees still starring vacantly at their computer screens.  No regard for the stress this caused to someone about to miss their international travel, they continued in their slow, bureaucratic way. In the end a ticket could not be produced even though I had paid.  A \"manager\" was supposed to see me through the gate, but he didn't come.  An employee took pity of me and let me through and I ran through the doors as they closed behind me 10 seconds later.  Very different to the Eurostar adverts.

I paid \u00a375 to upgrade to business class, for safety, but in business class everyone was without their masks as they were eating the provided meal\n- January 2021 social distancing was impossible at the St Pancras paperwork check, with a Eurostar employee actively encouraging people to bunch up\n- They advertise that all bookings are flexible but, unlike flexible flights, they must be rescheduled the week before travel, rather than the usual 24 hours.\n\nThe only reason I have continued to use Eurostar is that it is more environmentally friendly than flying.",

Ik heb ik tot op heden nog steeds geen antwoorden op mijn vragen m.b.t. de voucher die veel te laat is opgestuurd. Het betreft mijn geplande reis in de 2020. Als ik mijn reis opnieuw wil boeken voor augustus 2021, wordt ik al geconfronteerd met beperkte beschikbaarheid. 4 dagen Londen zit er daarom niet in. Echter mijn voucher loopt wel af. Communicatie verloopt moeizaam, als je al iemand aan de lijn krijgt. Reacties op mail krijg ik pas na 3 tot 4 maanden. Het enthousiasme om te reizen met Eurostar is weg. Ik laat de trein voor wat het is en ik neem maar mijn verlies. Wat ik in deze nog het ergste vind is dat dit een tripje zou zijn samen met mijn zoon voor zijn behaalde examen, in deze toch al moeilijke tijd....",

Uiteindelijk kregen we te horen dat het 14 dagen zou duren. We hebben maanden gewacht. Toen kregen we te horen: nog 28 dagen te horen. Weer een paar maanden gewacht. Deze week hoorden we nog 28 dagen. Ik schreef en zei dat ik de volgende stappen zou zetten. De NL-ombudsman stelde voor om contact op te nemen met een Britse waakhond genaamd London Travel Watch. We waren ook van plan om een class action suit te beginnen, omdat zoveel mensen boos zijn over deze slechte service. Vandaag kregen we eindelijk ons geld terug. Mijn advies: wees volhardend, en neem het mee naar de volgende stap. Wat ze doen zou illegaal moeten zijn. We hebben drie reizen (autohuur, vluchten, hotels) geannuleerd en eurostar was het enige bedrijf dat ons geld voor bijna 5 maanden heeft ingehouden.",

However, they insisted on giving me a voucher instead of a refund. I called to dispute this and they agreed that this was unfair and that they would have to send a voucher due to their system already being programmed this way, but I could receive a refund for the voucher. I still haven't received the voucher nine months down the line. This is extremely greedy and disrespectful to their customers, and the lack of consistency regarding the treatment of my boyfriend and myself just goes to show that they have no clear system and do not care about customer service. Had no problems with refunds from Ryanair and Easyjet! Will never use Eurostar again.",

        "review_text": "I had the worst eurostar experience yesterday 23 October 2020, afternoon train. \nIt is been few weeks/months that eurostar is struggling with covid, constantly cancelling bookings. \nThose cancellated booking are free of charge replacement. But those ticket always disappear from the eurostar app. So it is difficult to track ticket whose has been cancelled. So you always have to go back to your booking emails, if you still have them. It is OK if you one ticket cancelled but when you have 10 return tickets it is really painful and not clear. \nIn addition, you cannot change them on the app as from time to time it does not work. \nSo as I could not change my ticket I went to eurostar yesterday beforr departure as i have done it several times before, I asked someone to change my ticket to the next departure. But, when I arrived they had no one from eurostar able to change my cancelled tickets due to a reduction of staf in the station. But had 3 people there to say 'hi' to people!? Find the error !\nThe staf there was berly speaking French. Feel really offended that the line manager present there expected me to speak with me in  flamish to explain the current issue.  Feel a bit of racism! She did not want to help me at all.\nLater on, an other lady arrived, a bit late 15minutes before departure. She was almost having an heart attack when the eurostar line manager told her she cannot get in. The line manage and her colleague have not moved a fingers in order to help this poor lady while having an shorten breath. She would have let her die. \nIt is unbelievable how eurostar is dealing with covid issue. It is the worst experience I have ever had. How people can be that unrespectful?\nEurostar should review they staf and find helpful staf, willing to help passengers in this diffucult time and not make the passanger life even more diffucult. \nNext time I will travel by flight.",

Eurostar refused to change this leg of the journey for me despite the inconvenience they caused. They told me the only option I had was to get the voucher and rebook the entire journey back. But the entire journey back including changing the Sncf trains last minute would have cost us 2.5x the price of our original tickets. No compensation, no help, just a stressful two hours on the phone arguing with them to end up with nothing. Holidays cancelled. Oh and yes now I need to wait 28 days to be able to use up my voucher.

Your customer service is hard to reach. \n\nProblem 1 - back in June I was coming back from France to the UK and my tickets were canceled and your website wouldn't let me change my ticket so I had to buy a new one. I sent you an email asking for a refund and I still didn't get a reply. Can someone reply to me and pay me back for this please it has been months. \n\nProblem 2: I have a trip to the UK next week and my train both ways was canceled, I was told to change my train free of charge but when I go to manage my booking all the options are paid. I am being asked to pay \u00a3105 for changing my trains. I now tried several times to log in and log out from my account, once I saw the options to be free (which is how it should be) so I selected the options and pressed a button to change my ticket, but guess what the Eurostar website decided to crash. It's saying \"we are almost there\" for the past 15 minutes. So as a result I still did not manage to change my tickets. I am posting here and on Twitter in a hope to get a response.",

        "review_text": "Mijn vriend en ik wilden enkele romantische dagen in Londen beleven voor Valentijn. We hadden eerste klasse geboekt, maar om de een of andere reden kwamen we terecht in een tweedeklasserijtuig van aan aftandse trein. Er was geen WiFi beschikbaar. Bij vertrek werd aangekondigd dat het personeel regelmatig door de trein zou komen, we hebben de treinmanager welgeteld 1 keer door de trein zien rennen. Toen we bij aankomst in Londen ons beklag gingen doen, bleek dat ze een oude ipv een nieuwe trein hadden ingelegd en dat daardoor onze zitplaats- en wagonnummer aangepast was. Natuurlijk werden we daar bij vertrek niet van ingelicht, maar wel pas bij aankomst. Een compensatie konden we niet krijgen, want ze vonden dat het onze fout was. Op de terugweg zaten we dan wel in eerste klasse en wonder boven wonder was de treinmanager daar zeer beschikbaar. Hij had zich namelijk bij enkele reizigers die hij kende geplaatst (die volgens ik begrepen had van de steward bovendien kaartjes voor tweedeklas hadden) en was gezellig wijntjes aan het drinken met hen. Tegen Brussel was hij stomdronken en kon hij zelfs niet meer rechtop wandelen! Veiligheid voorop? Het personeel sprak bovendien amper Nederlands of Engels, enkel de aankondigingen in het Frans waren verstaanbaar (alhoewel bij aankomst in Brussel de treinmanager zo dronken was dat ook dat op niets meer leek). Ik heb dit alles in een klacht gemeld, maar de klantendienst heeft zich er zonder compensatie met een goedkoop standaardantwoord vanaf gemaakt. Volgende keer vliegen we. Eurostar neem ik nooit meer.",

They cancelled and rebooked our journey multiple times, costing us hundreds of pounds, saying we had to pay again for each rebooking. In the end, the trains they booked were so messed up that we arrived from Amsterdam to Brussels AFTER our train from Brussels to London left. Thus, missing our ride back home. We spent so much extra money trying to get back to the UK. \n\nAnd, although I deeply support and understand the current COVID19 sensitivity and the required guidelines, I suffer from severe eczema on my face, which makes me medically exempt from face masks. I still do my best to put up with the pain and wear a face mask for as many hours as I can.  Wearing one for a prolonged amount of time causes bleeding and a lot of pain. After the first 2 hours of the journey, my skin needed a break, but when I informed the attendants, they told me unless I had a medical report from a hospital, I wasn\u2019t allowed to take it off. UK laws strictly prohibit anyone from asking for a medical report to prove you are exempt from face masks due to a medical disability, which can be seen on the government website. However, Eurostar is clearly exempt from government guidelines. I felt really embarrassed trying to explain my health condition, which feels so private, and the UK guidelines to an attendant while the whole carriage listened.",

Five days before we were due to travel, we got a message saying our train had been cancelled, but we would be issued with a voucher, which we could offset against future travel.\n\nIf a service provider fails to provided the service which has been contractually agreed, without offering a valid reason, then they are in breach of contract. Eurostar's reson was 'Covid-19 restrictions'. At the time, the restrictions were no different to when we made our outward journey so this was nonsense. In any case, if they don't provide the service, they are legally obliged to make a full refund.\n\nAnyway, to continue. Although our train was cancelled, they had another one available, for which we could book tickets at almost 4 X the cost of the original ones. You might ask why they didn't simply offer us travel on that train using our original tickets, if seats were available. We wondered that too and emailed Eurostar, but three days later, there is still no reply.\n\nEffectively, Eurostar abandoned its customers in a foreign country and offered not a jot of support, simply asking for more money. Bearing in mind the current situation, I would put this on the same level as profiteering in wartime. Their behaviour is absolutely despicable.\n\nDespite the inconvenience and added time, I will be driving to Europe in future, rather than travelling with this bunch of crooks",

They clearly do not want future custom as not offering a refund only e-voucher (because we can all afford to go on massive holidays every year!). I would happily pay a charge or only get a partial refund but they were having none of it. \n\nI am going to left with a useless voucher that I will never use. Just avoid Eurostar, the headache is not worth it.\n\nUPDATE\n\nAfter 4 days I finally got a phone call from a manager who just did not care at all that the vouchers would be useless to me. It is not often I slam the phone down on someone but  in this case I did. It was like talking to a robot.",

        "review_text": "One member of gate staff at London was a bit rude with a passive-aggressive \u201cCan I help you?!\u201d bellowed at me as I struggled to retrieve my passport within the requisite 15 seconds, but apart from her I found the staff to be fairly helpful.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame the same cannot be said for the Border Control staff, whom I found quite rude and arrogant, with an attitude that suggests they\u2019re somehow doing you a favour by letting you proceed beyond their little glass cubicle after waiting in a long, snaking queue with little regard for social distancing for 20 minutes because they can only be bothered to put two staff on, despite knowing well in advance the number of passengers to expect.) However, I do understand there\u2019s probably not much Eurostar can do about this.\n\nThe journey itself was pleasant, smooth and quick through to Lille and back to London. The tickets are quite pricey, but fairly reasonable considering the trains can only run at a limited capacity at the moment.\n\nIt was a similar experience on the way back, with two polite and helpful Eurostar staff on arrival at the terminal, an extremely rude and shouty English border control woman, a very polite and friendly one and a really rude and an arrogant French cop.\n\nNote that you have to bring your completed 'Passenger Locator Form' with you and present it at the UK Border Control cubicle, not on the train as I\u2019d expected, something that is not made clear. (They may ask some questions, the answers to which you\u2019ve already provided on the form but they don't read beyond your name and address.) It would have been helpful to have a sign advising passengers to have this ready, along with their travel documents. The Eurostar staff should have mentioned this on our arrival, before we proceeded to passport control.\n\nSocial distancing isn\u2019t really enforced at either end but there was an announcement reminding people to wear face coverings whilst onboard.\n\nOne really irritating thing at Lille was the inability to easily find the train formation so you can be in the right place to board your carriage, and the lack of platform staff to assist. There were a couple of confusing electronic signs I found eventually but I still ended up getting on carriage 10 instead 4. It was fairly empty so I stayed there for entire journey.\n\nAnother annoying thing was that the WiFi didn\u2019t work on either the outbound or return journey, regardless of whether or not we were in a tunnel.\n\nAnd (unsurprisingly) the travelator and escalator didn't work at St. Pancras on return.\n\nI did find the Eurostar app pretty handy, however. It keeps details of your booking including tickets, seat reservations etc.\n\nAll in all I was happy with the service provided by Eurostar but there is certainly room for improvement. And don\u2019t expect check-in to be a pleasant experience. Be prepared to queue for ages and be treated with utter contempt, like you\u2019re a total inconvenience by the border and security people. \n\nNice once you\u2019re on the train though.",

It is a disgrace how the company is playing on COVID-19!

Eurostar used to be good, I'm a regular traveller (or was before the pandemic) but their service has gone completely down the toilet in recent years, just awful. Always late, dreadful new trains, expensive tickets, bad food, awful wi-fi that never works etc etc...   Anyway, had a train book for June 2020 - middle of lockdown - so clearly couldn't travel.  It's utter lies on their website that they say they will contact you - they don't and never will.  I emailed them 5 times and NEVER got a reply (still to this day!), phoned many times and usually got cut off after waiting an hour or so.  Eventually got hold of someone a week before the travel date and was told the train will likely be cancelled, but they can't say yet so wouldn't refund me but offered vouchers.  I wanted a refund, so they said call back the following week.  I did, took forever again to get through and was told they don't know again blah blah excuses excuses so when I said 'ok, I'll turn up tomorrow at St Pancras and expect my money if you cancel' he said 'hang on - oh it's just been cancelled, so yes you can have a refund'.  Just total lies, the chances of it being cancelled while I was on the phone is just rubbish.  Anyway, I agreed and took the refund - which of course then never happened.  I had to make 3 further calls over the following weeks and was told 'we're looking in it' each time, fob off after fob off.  On the last call I advised them I was telling our bank to retrieve the money directly from them.  The next day they transferred the money to our account.  Awful company.\n\n** NEW NOTE - decided actually to post a comment made to me my a good Eurostar staff member who wanted to speak out.  Their new trains are terrible for the tracks they told me, causing them damage (ie costing more in repair at some point).  Eurostar also know the 'new' trains make people (including staff) feel sick, unlike the old style trains.  Interestingly, they told me that some years ago, the person in charge at the time of the deal with Seimens to build the 'new' trains has since left Eurostar and now works for Seimens.

I will be sleeping on the street for 3 nights til they can get me back on the price I paid, which is 4 days away.So Eurostar cancels,trains are still travelling but you have to pay 200 pounds to get back. In addition, they are offering evouchers, not refunds, and telling passengers they will have to pay any difference when passengers use them. I would never book with this company again.

Eurostar offered me travel vouchers for the first 2 trips and refunded me for the 3rd (because I had only bought cancellation protection for the 3rd trip). The refund came to me within 7 days and it took just over 3 months for the vouchers to come through. This was quite a long time for the vouchers, but I never doubted that they would eventually come through and I was not disappointed. Over that 3-month period, Eurostar were great at continuing to update me about the status of the vouchers, which I really appreciate because it let me know that they hadn't forgotten or gone back on their word. Just like any transport company, Eurostar can make logistical errors, but in my experience, they have always corrected their errors by offering compensation and have always made me feel like a valued customer. Even when I have made my own logistical errors in the past, the staff have always been quick and keen to help me find a solution in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.",

I feel I\u2019m being ripped off!\n\nWill I be able to travel in 2021? Will there still be restrictions on travelling in 2021? Will COVID-19 still be killing people? Will we be vaccinated?\n\nEurostar cannot answer those questions but feel entitled to hang on to customers\u2019 money! That\u2019s dishonest!\n\nI tried to get my money refunded by Rail Europe but was told they cannot do that because Eurostar does not have a refund policy.\n\nI contact Eurostar and am told that I must get the refund from Rail Europe. \n\nThis is not a way to treat customers. Eurostar, change your refund policy! Be honest! Give back the money to your customers!\n\nHonest companies like the SNCF and First Great Western refunded me without a single problem.

Vouchers are a complete waste of time as family and job circumstances meant that re-booking is impossible. Other companies are able to do the decent thing and be sympathetic to the hardships of all families impacted by the pandemic. Refunding quickly and openly would actually build up customer trust and confidence for future and repeat business. But sadly their policies is set in way to frustrate and skewed in their favour. At a time where we all need to show a little kindness, I feel it's sorely lacking with this company. I for one will never want to deal with Eurostar again. Don't forget, the pandemic will come and go. But a bad customer experience, lasts a lifetime. Signed up to Trust Pilot to warn others.",

        "review_text": "Edit au 12/06/2020\n\nJ\u2019ai enfin re\u00e7u le solde de ma commande en vouchers.\nIls ont du me prendre pour une dingue avec mon mail... \ud83e\udd23\n\n**************************************************\n\nCher Eurostar,\n\nJe t\u2019\u00e9cris aujourd\u2019hui pour t\u2019exprimer mon m\u00e9contentement, toi en qui j\u2019ai toujours eu confiance et qui m\u2019a transport\u00e9 de nombreuses fois vers mon pays de coeur.\n\nLe 11 mars, j\u2019ai effectu\u00e9 une r\u00e9servation de billets pour Londres, pour DEUX voyageurs, au mois de mai (pauvre folle que j\u2019\u00e9tais). Le montant de ma commande s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 156 \u20ac.\n\nLe 14 avril, face au contexte de pand\u00e9mie et aux annonces du gouvernement, j\u2019annulais notre voyage et faisais une demande de e-vouchers.\n\nLe 21 avril, je recevais une r\u00e9ponse de ta part. J\u2019\u00e9tais very happy jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que je me rende compte que les vouchers que tu m\u2019avais envoy\u00e9s ne correspondaient qu\u2019\u00e0 UN seul voyageur alors que tu disais : \u00ab\u00a0Please find your 2 eVouchers below, with a total amount of 78 \u20ac. This is equal to the full value of your original booking\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nMais mon original booking \u00e9tait de 2x78 \u20ac, rappellons le.\n\nJe t\u2019ai alors renvoy\u00e9 un mail dans la foul\u00e9e, pour te demander ce qu\u2019il advenait du reste de ma r\u00e9servation.\n\nLe 20 mai, ne voyant rien venir et estimant qu\u2019un mois de plus \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un mois de trop, j\u2019ai appel\u00e9 ton service clients.\n\nApr\u00e8s m\u2019avoir fait patienter de longues minutes, la dame au bout du fil m\u2019a inform\u00e9e que les demandes \u00e9taients trait\u00e9es par un prestataire externe et qu\u2019il fallait que j\u2019attende une date ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour qu\u2019on m\u2019envoie les 2 vouchers manquants. J\u2019ai alors demand\u00e9 s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus simple d\u2019envoyer les avoirs des 2 voyageurs d\u2019une m\u00eame commande en m\u00eame temps et elle m\u2019a r\u00e9pondu que non, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas votre process.\n\nSachant qu\u2019on a jusqu\u2019en septembre pour effectuer une autre r\u00e9servation jusqu\u2019en mars 2021.\n\nMais tu sais, Eurostar, un voyage, si court soit-il, \u00e7a s\u2019organise. Il faut que chacun puisse prendre ses dispositions de son cot\u00e9, avec son employeur, et ca peut prendre du temps. (oui, je reste optimiste et esp\u00e8re que la situation sanitaire mondiale va s\u2019arranger et qu\u2019on pourra de nouveau voyager avant l\u2019an 3000).\n\nEt puis, tu le sais aussi, Eurostar, plus t\u00f4t on r\u00e9serve, plus on a de chances d\u2019obtenir un tarif avantageux.\n\nJe te remercie donc de bien vouloir te pencher sur mon cas, ma patience ayant atteint ses limites (surtout que dans ton mail automatique de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ma demande de vouchers, tu t\u2019engageais \u00e0 me les adresser sous 28 jours)\n\nCordialement,\n\n\nPS : tu rel\u00e8veras certainement que - contrairement \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 de mes concitoyens tr\u00e8s remont\u00e9s, dont les avis fleurissent un peu partout sur le net - je ne te demande pas un remboursement fiduciaire de mes billets mais que la dotation en e-vouchers corresponde au montant int\u00e9gral que j\u2019ai d\u00e9bours\u00e9 pour les acheter. Ce serait la moindre des choses.",

You cant contact Eurostar but only acompany called Voucher Express who looked into it but nothing could be done to let me use other vouchers. I thought I would use the remaining voucher this year but couldn't book anything on Eurostar due to the travel restrictions. I  ontacted voucher express to ask for\na voucher extension to use next year  They looked into it but it wasnt possible. They just administer the vouchers but dont set the terms and conditions. Eurostar do.  So that voucher has gone to waste. Save your money and give someone cash instead of buying vouchers for Eurostar. It's a shame as travelling with Eurostar is good",

I wrote to Eurostar to ask whether, as we can\u2019t get to Brussels (because you\u2019ve cancelled it PLUS we would not be permitted into Belgium as this is non-essential travel for us), we are entitled to a refund for the inbound train as well as the outbound? Useless answer was received from them which comprised of some meaningless pre-approved sentences, probably generated by a computer. Regardless, I decided to at least make my claim for the cancelled outbound train while I decided what to do with the inbound- I started this yesterday and am still trying today - the refund page just times out. My broadband speed is excellent and I have also downloaded Chrome in case Safari is the problem.  I do not believe the refund page being down is a coincidence and I will be contacting the media right now.",

WRONG. A train that doesn't run is CANCELLED and as such a refund is a legal necessity. Bullying passengers into accepting unusable alternative vouchers is another of their scams. DON'T accept this. After the first FREE voucher exchange you will pay normal prohibitive penalties for a second change. You will also pay the new price mark-up for a ticket. Currently that's more than a 100% increase. Never again, I hear you say. Cheaper to fly, or drive. Driving used to be fun. CEO needs to stand tall and be fair",

I feel they are actual thieves, they are agents for SNCF travel as part of our trip, SNCF emailed to say a refund for that part could be claimed from the agent, which is Eurostar who of course have done nothing. I have been a regular customer for years, never really enjoyed it, have made many other complaints. This is the pits. This is a majority state-owned company, what are they playing at?

My train was cancelled and I was notified by both text and email. I was offered the voucher option again, however found the refund link on their website and completed this. Receipt of this form was acknowledged and refund was back on my credit card within 3 working days.

They seem to try and frustrate customers in order to persuade them to accept a time limited voucher. It is clear from their schedules that services have been cancelled with a very limited skeleton service to and from Paris and Brussels but they will not accept as cancelled any service more than 48 hours in advance.",

We do not know if travel will be available again and to make people book by the end of September, to use by the end of March 2021 is appalling. The least that could be done is give a voucher to use in the next couple of years. All other forms of transport; airlines, trains etc. are giving full cash refunds, which is how it should be dealt with. I shall not be using Eurostar again in the future.",

In general I have purchased the tickets for myself and my mum for \u00a3178, however later paid additional \u00a372 for the extension. When spoke to the lady on the phone been told will be given full value again.none ever mentioned that extensions can not be claimed as a voucher.Just called, lady on the phone did not even introduce her name and was insisting that i can not get a voucher for the extension. When I told her for the third time that it is not mentioned anywhere she put me on hold and disappeared. After 10 minutes being on hold the line just cut off. Tried to call back and the voicemail said that this department is now closed.SERIOUSLY???This is how you do value your customers???This is a joke!!!!!!",

In the website, they prompt you to ask for an voucher if you have been affected by Covid, so you would follow all the steps assuming that's the right way to go.\n\nOnce I received my voucher, to be used by Sept 2020, I asked to get a refund, as I don't know when I will be travelling again. They refuse to refund me as they say \"I waved my rights for a refund when I asked for a voucher\". Its unacceptable as this was not clearly stated.\n\nI may use the voucher I have, as its a lot of money. But I know one thing for sure: I will never travel with them if I can avoid it.",

This is the one company that will not do the right thing.  All other travel services, airlines, hotels, tour companies have refunded money, but Eurostar still refuses.   I will never forget how they treated us during this worldwide pandemic.   Shame on them!\n\nUPDATE (4/15/20):  I was scheduled to travel on 4/13/20 and received NO NOTIFICATION that my train was cancelled.  I tried to see my train on the site but it was so difficult, couldn\u2019t see it at all, no notice of trains cancelled.    So I decided to act like I was buying a ticket, took a screenshot of the train that was running (was not my train) and sent that to Eurostar.  It was only then that they advised that my train was cancelled and offered a refund.  This seems like extraordinary measures that we have to take during these unprecedented times.  It\u2019s sad that they won\u2019t do the right thing for its customers.  This whole experience just confirms that I will not use them in the future, because they clearly have lost site of how to treat customers.",

Wait until they finalize their train schedules 1 day before your trip before filing for the appropriate refund. If you ask them to refund you a week before your trip, they will merely decline your refund request. Write them an email asking for the refund. Cite the fact that they were the ones who cancelled your train schedule and that you do not want a voucher. Inform them that this is based on Passenger Rights Regulations. We were able to claim a full refund via this process.  \n\nHowever if your train schedules happen to be operational on that day then you are out of luck and your only recourse would be to take their voucher.",

Belgium closed their borders to tourists weeks ago, so by that point Eurostar were unable to provide the service I had paid for.\nI contacted Eurostar, no response at all on attempt number 1. Tried again, zero empathy and no flexibility in the timescale of vouchers offered.\nI object to their system of only giving a voucher that must be booked by a certain time and to then travel at times I do not want to go. I might be swayed if the voucher extended to the end of April so I could attempt to re-do the birthday celebrations a year later. \n\nAbsolute refusal to give me a voucher extended by one month.\nAll hotels in UK and Belgium have refunded in full, UK train service promised a full refund (not received yet).\nWho knows when Belgium will re-open it\u2019s borders, what will survive in Belgium and whether it will be worth going?\n\nNow my train has been removed from the list of services. No communication from Eurostar!. Just hoping they can keep my money.\n\nI have raised a complaint with my credit card company \u2013 you do have some protections (maybe) but if enough credit card companies & banks pound them with refund requests maybe they\u2019ll change their policy?\nWill avoid ever travelling on Eurostar again regardless if this gets resolved, would rather spend hours throwing up on a ferry.\n\nI cannot see that they are regulated by any travel organisation, they are however, regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. They recommend complaining to the Financial Ombudsman:\n\nTrustpilot won't let me load the links, easy to find. Check the FCA first and follow consumer/how to complain\n\nFCA do have an email address for fraudulent activity. Look under Consumers, coronavirus, contact us.",

I applied for an evoucher to at least maybe try to rebook but I can't have the portion linked to her passenger info. I paid for her tickets so why do I not get value even in vouchers? We were able to cancel with no fees and little difficulty with every other company we booked with (positive shoutout to Air Canada, Air BNB, and Booking.com) except Eurostar. Absolute thievery in a time of crisis. I requested the vouchers over two weeks ago and still have not heard back my train is due to leave tomorrow. After contacting them via Twitter, an employee offered me a full refund in my DMs. They then sent me vouchers.

        "review_text": "Today's news for Brits:\nCoronavirus: Brits told to cancel holidays 'indefinitely'' as Foreign Office changes travel advice!\nThe advice just changed from canceling for 30 days to 'Indefinitely'.\nI looked on the Eurostar app and see our train Has a question mark.\nBut....they continue to say, keep your original booking or you may change the booking for another date free of charge. How can one choose another date when nobody knows when it is going to be safe? Or our governments 'indefinite' will end!\nWhen I originally contacted Eurostar I was told that they are tasking the situation gradually as things move on, and if We wanted to change the date then we could with a \u00a340 fee.\nSurely it is illegal to keep our money if our government is advising us NOT to travel?\nHad no problem with getting a full refund for two weeks accommodation. Premier Inn automatically refunded for the night before departure but Travellodge on return offered a voucher until the end of the year, still waiting!",

Is this fair?? No it\u2019s not!! It\u2019s disgusting and nauseating at best.\nWith peoples livelihoods at risk with companies months away from closure or making redundancies, with many of us I hate to say at risk of contracting the virus and not surviving it - what Value is there in an e-voucher?? None!! It doesn\u2019t put food on a families table.\nOf course Eurostar know this and it\u2019s not something that never crossed their mind, it\u2019s just something they don\u2019t give a damn about. This is about self preservation and bonuses at top level. \nOnly two wordS to describe this company - VILE and UNETHICAL!!",

This means that passengers will only be allowed to cross the border into Europe if they are: EU citizens of mainland continental Europe returning home/UK & Non-EU citizens with a residency permit in an EU country/Essential workers, which is equivalent to a cancellation of the service for ineligible passengers.\n\nWe are non-EU citizens who had intended to visit Belgium using Eurostar and due to our age and health have no idea whether we will be able to travel again or be alive to travel again. An e-voucher may potentially be worthless.\n\nAll UK Rail Operators we had advance bookings with have considered that these are unprecedented times and have offered refunds on prepaid tickets, including Advance Tickets, waiving cancellation fees as well. Standard refund policy should not apply in these unprecedented times where Governments are making extraordinary decisions for the welfare of their citizens.\n\nDespite Eurostar stating \"Our main priority is the health and wellbeing of our customers and colleagues. We are listening closely to the feedback of our customers and colleagues\", they remain inflexible despite extenuating circumstances outside the control of all concerned in providing refunds for Standard and Premium Tickets purchased for many who either have no idea whether they will travel in the future or may be physically unable to. \n\nEurail, however, are  offering the following: please see their website /coronavirus-update\n\nIf you purchased a full-price Pass on or after June 1st, 2019 and before April 1st, 2020, you are entitled to a 100% refund (normally 85% refundable).\nIf you purchased a promotional-price Pass on or after June 1st, 2019 and before April 1st, 2020, you are entitled to an 85% refund (normally non-refundable).\n\nWhy?\nEurail - We care deeply about the health and safety of our customers and want to support all travelers who were planning to travel with a Eurail or Interrail Pass. We strongly believe that health is more important than mobility. We are therefore suspending our normal cancellation policy for travelers who are affected by Coronavirus.",

Which needs to be used within a year, and is impractical for an American who was on vacation in Europe, and won't make it back in the foreseeable future.

I contacted Eurostar again and they agreed to refund the cost of both the outward and return journeys. They should be doing this anyway irrespective of whether your train runs as travel to France is prohibited for the vast majority of people!. Anyway, my advice is before your date of travel CHECK TO SEE IF YOUR TRAIN IS RUNNING and if not then email them and ask for a refund. Most trains are cancelled so you have a good chance. \nThis should be an automatic option for everyone at the moment. we shouldn't have to fight for it.

Hotels have cancelled and refunded all bookings, it is only right that transport companies do the same! \n\nEurostar's offer of a voucher to be booked before September 30, 2020 and used before March 31, 2021 is completely nonsensical. Not only are the first 6 months of that voucher completely useless due to the GLOBAL BORDER LOCKDOWNS and EU restrictions but to expect people to book new dates under duress before September 2020 is unfair and illogical. \n\nWe are international travellers - we simply cannot rebook an entire new international holiday on a whim. We need approvals from work, school and global government border security to travel. \n\nAt the very least, the FAIR and RIGHT thing for Eurostar to do is offer a 24 month voucher. Or the current e-voucher option but with the option to refund after March 31, 2021 if we have not been able to secure new travel dates. \n\nUnscrupulous behaviour and a prime example of corporate greed. I certainly won't use again. Flights much cheaper and faster then this novelty mode of transport. Don't waste your money or energy.",

I booked tickets for myself and husband on Eurostar for April/May 2020 as part of a greater trip to the UK. All airlines, hotels, tour companies and Trainline have agreed to full refunds due to the Covid 19 pandemic. I graciously thank them and will re book with them when I can. Eurostar want to provide an e-voucher that is valid for less than 12 months! Do you know CEO where New Zealand is? It's not easy just to pop over and re plan a large trip again. You are a greedy unpleasant company that have no interest or care for your customers and at such a tragic time too. People want their hard earned money back, its not yours its ours so show some decency and the public will support you in the future if not, I daresay there maybe a sad future for Eurostar after this.",

Therefore, I request the cancellation of the voucher and, consequently, the refund through the credit card used at the time of purchase. I await an answer.\n\nEUROSTAR:\n\nHello,\n\nAs your train went ahead as planned and was not cancelled, we are unable to offer you a refund. You can still claim the e-vouchers however. If you are not happy with that, I advise you to contact your travel insurance to see if they can cover any costs.\n\nWith kind regards,\nRaiko\nEurostar Customer Care\n\nMe:\n \nI would like to clarify some facts,\nfirst my train was canceled and there was a change of schedule due to reduced travel, I would like you to check the information, and another point as the passengers were not European we could not board due to the restrictions of the French government. We buy tickets on several train companies in Europe such as: Deutsche Bahn, OuiSncf, Flixbus, Ouibus among others. All companies refunded the ticket, except for your company, I am very disappointed with the conduct of the Eurostar company, I had already traveled a few times with the company, and I have always spoken well about the company until now.\n\nEUROSTAR:\n\nHello,\n\nYour train was not cancelled. It was one of the 3 trains still going on the 26th of March. If we cancelled your train, you would also have received a refund from us as you did from the other companies you mentioned.

In their own terms and conditions they state that you can get a refund if a train does not run.\n\nHowever, they failed to put any information about refunds onto their website, implying that your only option is a credit note.  This was the same in emails that they sent to me when I asked the question to then directly. They purposefully did not mention refunds as being a possibility.\n\nI then threatened to report them to trading standards unless they refunded my money.  This worked and I now have my refund.\n\nI am deeply angry that such a large company would act in such a devious and deceitful manner.  \n\nHow many people have they conned using this tactic - people who have lost hard earned money by being fobbed off with evouchers they don\u2019t want rather than the refund they are entitled too.

I would also like to assure you that your comments regarding this, have been logged for the attention of our senior management. While one customer\u2019s feedback may not warrant a change in policy, if we receive enough feedback to determine that customers are not happy with the current structure, then this may indicate that things need to be reviewed and some changes made.\n\nAt present we haven't been issued with the finalised timetables for trains on 22 or 25 April 2020. These will be released 24 - 48 hours before the actual dates. In the event that either of your trains are cancelled, then you will be eligible to claim a refund for your return tickets, which is in line with Passenger Rights Regulations (PRR).\n\nIf your trains are both still running, then the option would be to claim the e-voucher to the value of the amount paid for the ticket. Although this must be used by 30 September 2020, passengers will be able to select travel dates up to 29 March 2021. If you are unable to use this due to your personal circumstances, then there is the option to allow someone else to use it in your place.\n\nFailing that, then you can contact your travel insurer to see if you are able to claim for the cost of your unused tickets through them. \n\nI am sorry that I am unable to agree to your request at present but please keep an eye on our website, www,eurostar,com, for further updates regarding the timetables on 22 and 25 April 2020. Once these have been released, then you will have a better idea of which option is best for you. \n\nI wish you all the best at this difficult time and remain available if you have any further questions.\n\nKind regards,\n\nNatalie\nChief Executive's Office\nEurostar International Ltd.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nThis email (including any attachments) is intended only for the addressee(s), is confidential and may be legally privileged.

        "review_text": "It is no surprise that Eurostar are an immoral disgrace of a business. The CEO, Mike Cooper should frankly be imprisoned for fraud and ripping off customers and I know there are 1000s of customers out there who would agree 100% with me. \n\nA bit of background...Mike Cooper has been in senior roles in EasyJet, then Arriva and then Yodel. Literally 3 of the worst companies on the planet with the worst track records for staff attitude and company performance. How sad that a once excellent business like Eurostar has employed such a person to destroy their business. In these unprecedented times, I have no doubt whatsoever that decisions like the ones I will describe are being made by the board of directors in companies, and ultimately it is the CEO, as they are accountable. \n\nAs per the huge number of reviews in the last 2 months that are ALL 1* (and would be 0* if that was an option), this is the scenario...many people booked travel from the UK to France or Belgium in good faith to enjoy well earned breaks. In many cases, like mine, this was a surprise trip (in my case for my fianc\u00e9es 30th birthday celebrations) and we were very excited about travelling to Eurodisney in late May.\n\nThen COVID-19 came along. As of a couple of weeks ago, ALL foreign travel was banned by the UK government. So I can\u2019t travel by Eurostar. Disney closed ALL of its sites worldwide including Paris. The Radisson hotel near Disneyland Paris is closed.\n\nSo why would I want a train trip to Disneyland Paris on Eurostar? And why would I want to put our lives at risk? And why are you not offering full refunds? And why do you think e-vouchers that are valid for a few months are acceptable to customers, when your business may not (and hopefully will not) exist anymore in several months time?! I have no idea in the current climate when we will be able to rebook our holiday!\n\nCustomers want, need and should be legally entitled to full refunds! \n\nI also want to know why the UK and French governments have not stepped up their game and made it a legal requirement for ALL companies to issue full 100% refunds for customers who request this? We are legally not allowed to leave our houses except to buy food, drink and medicine so how the heck does Eurostar imagine we would make it to France?! Utter imbeciles.\n\nI genuinely hope there are some company CEOs who are arrested at the end of this pandemic, and I genuinely hope there are many businesses who never ever trade again as Eurostar is a national disgrace in the face of the many businesses out there who have evolved their companies and adapted to these extreme situations and looked after their customers.",

It's just thievery, completely unjustified in these times, when all train tickets on SNCF can be refunded without quibble. No refund possible unless my train is actually cancelled, which I won't know until very close to the supposed travel date and time. And if I don t claim my e-voucher before departure?

        "review_text": "I booked my ticket in January for my trip in February and when outbreak happened, first I wanted to cancel it. I contacted Eurostar and they told me it is not a risk and there is nothing wrong and I can travel. Then France set a lock down, I contacted to cancel my ticket and they said they run a normal service with clean trains. I paid twice of my train ticket and changed it as they forced me, however governments started to lockdown right after. I contacted again and they said they still have reduced time table and clean trains and they can't cancel or refund. Then they started to offer e-vouchers that you have to use in 2020. I DON'T WANT E-VOUCHERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS CRISIS! It is a SHAME that just to keep money they refuse to refund and trying to make most of the pandemic! They just take your money, risk your life and keep all the money to themselves. Now I am sitting with a \u00a3350 train ticket (with change fee) for a trip maybe I will never be able to make. You are horrible, you just  want money and even in this crisis you want to save your own company rather than people's lives. Just cancel the tickets and refund our money back! And keep your useless e-vouchers to yourselves.",

Au vu des circonstances, il est rentr\u00e9 en urgence la semaine derni\u00e8re, au vu du confinement et au vu des r\u00e9ductions de trains eurostar, il est \u00e9vident qu'elles n'ont pas pu partir ce mardi 24 mars (retour pr\u00e9vu sam 28 mars 2020). Aucune communication n'est possible avec Eurostar ! Ils nous proposent un avoir (que nous n'avons pas encore ! et on ne sait m\u00eame pas si notre demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 valid\u00e9e) \u00e0 utiliser entre juin et d\u00e9cembre. Mais ces 2 tantes ne veulent plus y aller car il n'y a plus de raisons pour y aller ! Je trouve inadmissible que Eurostar continue \u00e0 nous envoyer des mails pour nous proposer de changer l'heure de notre train alors qu'ils savent qu'elles ne sont pas parties ! On est inond\u00e9 de messages. Pour moi, ils gardent en circulation 2 trains pour ne pas avoir \u00e0 nous rembourser. Ils sont injoignables ! C'est sur autorit\u00e9 de l'Etat que les gens n'ont pas le droit de bouger. D'ailleurs je ne comprends pas qu'ils proposent encore des trains en dehors des rapatriements !",

Instead there's an Evoucher that expires way too soon, which I can't use anyway so I've just lost my money and they get to keep it without doing anything for it in return. A new trip is more expensive anyway, so you have to spend MORE with their company to get your own money back. Every other company is simply giving a refund but not them. Wish I had never booked a train in the first place.\n\nEdit - to make it worse: they give you several vouchers that make up the total of your original trip. You can only spend ONE voucher so you're forced to book several trips to get your original money back. So I'm supposed to spend more and more with them. I also can't spend the voucher anywhere but at the Eurostar website, where I've never made a booking before. I make my bookings on the website of NS International and I can't spend my voucher there so my money is simply gone up in smoke. Quick way to get rich for them.",

Again no as the trains are still running.\nNow we are being advised to not travel. Actually we cant travel out of our own countries. So again i request a refund. I get told my train has actually now been cancelled. Great I thought. But no, still I am not eligable for a refund. How the bloody hell not?!? \nThe service that I have booked and paid for, which was \u00a3360 by the way is no longer running. It has been cancelled. Yet I'm still expected to be ok with a bloody voucher to use at a later date.\nThe whole world is in the midst of a pandemic, with no one leaving their house. People losing their jobs, people dying. \u00a3360 to a family who is going through all this is a hell of alot of money. That is food on the table for a whole month In this time of uncertainty, stress and anxiety. Nobody knows when they will be able to travel again so a voucher is useless to everyone. \nDo what's right for your customers otherwise you will have to customers left once this pandemic is over.",

        "review_text": "Like many others our travel plans have fallen victim to the current Coronavirus containment measures - a 5 day over-weekend visit to London to include a day return on Eurostar to Brussels with other family members from the North of Scotland. The trip was booked months ago to take advantage of cheapest rail fares and overnight accommodation. It is not possible to reschedule or affordable to visit London simply to travel on a Eurostar train.\n\nTravel companies involved were pro active in contacting us offering the opportunity to reschedule or opt for a refund regardless of type of ticket bought or room rate secured. A massive \u201cWell Done\u201d to Premier Inn and LNER. Now what about Eurostar running trains to countries with \u201cClosed Borders\u201d - not heard a cheap during an ever evolving crisis. Speaking to somebody about the journey/tickets is an impossibility! \n\nTheir policy of offering an e-voucher for rebooking and travelling within a limited window is quite frankly CRIMINAL at a time when Governments in Belgium, France and here in the UK are offering advice on \u201clock down\u201d to curb the virus. WHY WOULD EUROSTAR ENCOURAGE TRAVELLERS TO GO ON A TRIP TO BRUSSELS (or Paris). THE IRRESPONSIBLE ANSWER IS \u201cSTAND AND DELIVER\u201d COVID 19 VIRUS TO \u201cA N OTHER\u201d i.e. commercialism over compassion and common sense.\n\nTo the CEO - Please switch on your TV or Radio and listen to Presidents and Prime Ministers telling citizens not to travel particularly if it\u2019s a non-essential journey i.e. a one day leisure trip to cities that are locked down! Do the right thing and offer to refund fares. You might just get a huge financial bonus or recognition for steering the company through a difficult time on an unprecedented scale. PRESENTLY YOU ARE RISKING SEVERE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR WHICH YOU MUST SHOULDER TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nWhen (not if) the company faces extreme financial difficulties from the severe reduction in ticket sales one must assume that you will not ask for any help from the Governments\u2019 who\u2019s advice you\u2019ve disregarded by insisting it\u2019s citizens must travel into the \u201ceye of the storm\u201d!\n\nI\u2019m in the very fortunate position of being able to stand the financial loss here. Your fares were ridiculously high in the first place. Many who were perhaps \u201cstretched\u201d to buy the ticket in the first place may well be facing extreme financial circumstances through no fault of their own. DO THE RIGHT THING AND DEVIATE FROM \u201cTHE SMALL PRINT\u201d AND OFFER REFUNDS NOW. DO NOT PREVARICATE WITH MEANINGLESS E-VOUCHERS.\n\nCustomer Care rating presently is sub-zero and I for one would have to think long and hard about travelling with the company going forward.",

This is a time where companies are showing their true colours and you are seeing true colours and those that really care about their customers. Eurostar are not offering refunds even though there is a travel ban. Yes the refund is a good gesture for those who are planning to travel at a later date, but our holiday to Disneyland Paris is not something we will rebooking for some time and a voucher is completely useless to me. Eurostar star have cancelled our train and therefore are not supplying the service they offered when I purchased my \u00a3360 ticket and should refund completely. If I ever plan on travelling to Europe once this pandemic is over I will not be using Eurostar and advise people boycott this company who really only care about profits and not their customers.",

Also, the UK government has advised against any non-essential travel abroad.\n\nHowever, Eurostar has decided to protect their shareholders instead of their customers by issuing an eVoucher that must be used by June to book a trip prior to the 12th of December, basically leaving all customers out of pocket in these difficult times.\n\nI will personally never travel again with Eurostar and I will make sure that anyone who I know is well aware of how cold and dissmissive this company is. If Eurostar collapses in the future due to this crisis I hope all shareholders remember the day in which they turned their backs on their customers, thinking in the short-term survival instead of the long-term business relationships.\n\nGood luck!",

Thalys trains have offered full refunds for ALL cancellations and EACH individual that had journeys booked received communication from the CEO of Thalys. Eurostar hasn't even sent an email. I have 3 tickets booked with Eurostar and one of them is a connecting journey with Thalys. I also have a stand alone ticket with Thalys which I have already received a FULL refund for. I cannot get a hold of any of the call center agents because the phone just rings and nobody answers. Pathetic service. Why can't the refunds be made instead of those stupid Vouchers? What if I am unable to use the Voucher by the end of June? What if I need to use less than the Voucher amount for a possible future journey? I want my money back, not vouchers. I expect to receive a response on this matter from Eurostar and I will continue to let people know what a rubbish service you'll provide.",

All have been courteous. Eurostar has lashed back at everyone I see on social media, travel sites, their own site (their FB site totally ignores the Pandemic like it doesn't exist), etc They are only offering waiver of change of date fees and from what I see on the travel sites, etc is a customer service department told to hold the line and be rude to all their customers. I wrote to customer service, got a long winded business as usual response from their FB Messenger and their CEO issued a ridiculous inconsiderate statement as if they were doing everyone a favor, on their website. In the current situation, who knows when we would be able to re-book and they were only giving to the end of the year despite most of Europe closed for business for the foreseeable future. We were so looking forward to doing the high speed Chunnel thing but I will make sure everyone knows about our experience with Eurostar.

They treat people like s**t, they are extremely rude and their prices are INSANELY expensive. Their food is the worst it gives food poisoning.\nNo humans in Eurostar, only robots. DO NOT BOOK\nOne day, they'll have a competitor and they'll have their eyes only to cry.",

        "review_text": "Eurostar states that its \"principal priority is the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and colleagues\" which sounds all lovely yet \"continue to operate our trains to all destinations\". People all over the world are taking precautions to limit the spread of the virus: meanwhile this company not only refuses refunds, free cancellations or free date changes it lowers prices for its tickets in a seemingly malicious tactic to encourage people to continue travelling. The company's inability to create concessions in this extremely rare event of a global health crisis is astounding. \n\nSince the 13/03/2020 the company extended a little olive branch for travelers travelling between certain dates where they offered 'eVouchers' that can be exchanged to cover costs for a future travel date (also date limited). Arranging another holiday especially with other people (my case) is difficult because everyone is not easily available at the same time. Not to even mention that we don't know when the outbreak will be fully resolved and people can safely travel again. The company would much rather have an administrative hassle of creating these 'eVouchers' than simply offering refunds at this sensitive time and allowing travelers to re-book on their own accord. This just shows how much this company prioritizes keeping their revenue over the health and safety of passengers. \n\nOther train companies such as Deutsche Bahn (Germany) and Renfe (Spain) are issuing refunds with no questions asked so don't try and argue \"that's what businesses are like\". Eurostar simply does not have the capacity to harbour any ounce of sympathy -- even in extreme times of worldwide pandemics. \n\nI regret booking with Eurostar. I chose them because their trains take you from city center to your destination's city center and would be quicker than flying from airports. From now on I will just take planes even if it means en extra leg of public transport to and from the airport or if its more expensive-- and I highly recommend you do too. Flight companies have more competition and much better customer service. \n\nEven if you read this review after the Coronavirus has been overcome, and you are entirely certain there won't be some worldwide catastrophe in the months leading up to your holiday (Exactly what I thought too!!!) I want to ask you: \n\nDo you really want to support a company with values like this?",

        "review_text": "During this worldwide health crisis, many transport companies (and others, even places like Disneyland) have stepped up to contribute their part and to take care of their customers in the interests of their health and safety and the greater community at large.\n\nNot only is Eurostar so far not stepping up to help their customers with credits, refunds or waived rebooking fees .... while the W.H.O. Issued a Level Three Travel Warning for many of the countries Eurostar serves, Eurostar\u2019s even continues to promote travel to and from those venues to likely further help spread COVID-19 and contribute to additional sickness and death of those customers and communities.\n\nShameful...\n\nBoycott!\n\nUpdate:  3/14/2020 -  I just noticed Eurostar has finally updated their web with an offer for eVouchers for certain travel due to COVID_19, let's see how it plays out.  Hopefully they are finally stepping up to the moral and ethical challenges!\n\n(This site does not allow URL's so go to the main Eurostar web and look at their special COVID-19 page...)\n\nUpdate: 3/17 - So now, apparently, they are cancelling a lot of trains but only posting the day ahead it seems, so not much lead time to poor passengers ...  at this point it seems a tactic by Eurostar to herd people to accepting their soft eVoucher and minimize their obligation to refund from them cancelling trains?\n\nUpdate: 3/18 - Still no substance.  Any legal firms out there considering a class action lawsuit?\n\nUpdate:  3/21 - So far they continue to be dodgy and unresponsive about refunds.  One train is canceled, the return from Paris next week (they know it, can\u2019t book it on their site, but they won\u2019t acknowledge it until it posts on their webpage on Monday....).  \n\nI did log a complaint with the UK gov watchdog londontravelwatch.org.uk\n\nUpdate - Mar 25 :  Well, true to form, checking on my app for my train today, even though it was canceled in various places on their web, they said it was still running but oddly asked if I wanted to reschedule or eVoucher ....  criminal deception, I would say.\n\nFor those seeking refunds on trains they cancel, they do have a section on their web where you can do it (as it is required by EU law, I think)  but it is very buried way down in their menu system (too bad TrustPilot doesn't allow links in these...)\n\nHowever, if you go their website and at the bottom, under \"Contact Us\"  it will bring up a help page..\n\nThe on the bottom left there is a block about \"Compensation\" - choose \"See More\"\n\nThen elect the link \"What Happens if Eurostar Cancels My Train\"  (It brings up more things to wade through, of course they are focusing on rescheduling and eVouchers...)\n\nOn the right, in the side bar there is a \"Most Popular\" section, select \"Can I cancel and get a refund online?\"\n\nBrings up more stuff to wade thorough related to vouchers and the like, but scroll down and find near the bottom...\n\n\"Other Questions You May Find Helpful\"\n\nAnd select the link..\n\nYet more stuff directing you to exchange, etc.\n\nBut find the link..\n\n\"What happens if Eurostar cancels my train?\"\n\nAnd yet again, toward the bottom...\n\n\"If you haven\u2019t travelled yet and your train is cancelled click here for information.\"\n\nAnd then, yet once more at the bottom of the page, you need to look carefully for this section...\n\n\"Request a full refund, regardless of your original ticket conditions.\"\n\nBe careful to look for and select the small text link that says...\n\n\"Claim a refund\"  that will finally take you to where you can enter your info for your cancelled train online.\n\nvs the big, more prominent BIG button \"CLAIM AN E-VOUCHER\" just below that section!\n\nHope this helps some of you in this awful time, being treated so badly by this company....\n\nUpdate:  April 1, 2020  - Unless it's some cruel April Fools joke - ha!... I finally got a full refund!  It took a lot of time and aggravation and lots of persistence on my part vs the other carriers who stepped up right away at the beginning.  So a cautionary tale for those considering this one in the future, though I do appreciate them finally doing so!\n\nUpdate - My refund posted to my credit card, but man, how much time and energy and anguish it took to do what should have been easy and simple.",

However I've just received an email from Eurostar to say that my train to Paris has been cancelled.  The email states I can get a refund, but the web page it sends me to does not allow a refund.  They don't say whether I can also get a refund for the return trip which hasn't been cancelled.  I can't contact them by 'phone - no answer and their chat line isn't responding even though it is supposed to be available from 7:00 to 23:00.

I have already purchased our tickets in January, hers in February, yet they won't let us stay together...Given the current situation of Corona Virus and a sharp decrease in world travel, you would think they would consider keeping a family together and provide for the situation...instead it appears they fear losing money in the time of an epidemic and charge more money to fill their pockets...Eurostar - if you're listening, reach out to me and make a difference in one family's life...don't be a corporate monger who doesn't give a care!! BTW, Delta took care of our international flights no problem...maybe you could take a clue from their action...thanks\n\nUPDATE 4 hours later...contacted them via Facebook and Messenger...still no help...even told them how Delta Corporate Office continued to help us and changed our flights to a later flight (for the whole family) so that we would only have to change the single seat for my wife and take the later train....still they sent me to their website to pay their change fees and new ticket price...still useless help...Maybe someone at the gate can help make this a reality...\n\nUPDATE: Corona Virus - President calling US citizens home...Delta immediately booked us on flights home...We are now in US want a refund on all Eurostar Tickets...Confirmation#s: QNYGHM and TRQIBS...waiting to hear from you Eurostar...",

For some reason when I booked my return ticket it booked it twice from the same destination in my case was London Amsterdam twice instead of London Amsterdam return. So I called the customer service and they said that they couldn\u2019t change it. So I asked if I could cancel or get a refund and no you cannot do nothing you can\u2019t even resell a ticket so that sit is going to be there empty for nobody to use. I don\u2019t understand what is the point of this if I am not going to use that seat why can I not give it to somebody else to use? And if the website made a mistake why can\u2019t you help me to change the destination? if you are really that cheap and customer service is not your priority then I don\u2019t see the point to have a customer service office in the first place. \nI travel a lot with Eurostar so now that I know that their customer service is so bad I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be traveling with you anymore so you just lost a customer.

The customer service is terrible and I can totally relate to other customers' experience. You feel almost belittled, and a bit disrespected, with the lack of disregard for the customer. They clearly know that i'll be losing money due to the fact that I purchased a train ticket for a friend (in May) who can no longer travel with me. I've offered to pay a change fee and yet, I still cannot do so because the tickets are \"standard\". The ticket is still good for a year they say, however, it can only be used by my friend since it's in her name. This is just terrible policy and business all around. Refund? Nope. Of course not. I'm totally taken back by this company as other travel companies that i've used for this particular trip decided to work with me (and show a little compassion) due to the circumstances. Never again will I use this company.",

I called the call center and they told me I would get charged AGAIN to change it back to the original booking!!!! This was an honest mistake that can happen to everyone, the fact that they don't take this into account is horrendous and very stressful. This is a clear fault in the system!!! I was also told by the man on the phone from the call center that I can fill out a form of complaint and wait for 2 DAYS for a manager to call me!

When we got on the train I was sat at one end of the carriage and my wife was sat at the other end , I showed the train manager the tickets and he just shrugged his shoulders and said it's full so we would have to sit in the new allocated seats. Also with the coronavirus making all the headlines I at least expected the train to have been cleaned so I was shocked when I pulled my table down only to see dirty smelly what look like somebody had  sneezed all over the place and spat the food out as well on it ,  lucky enough I was carrying  wet wipes so could clean it before use. The whole journey was was a trip from hell, the food was disgusting my wife left hers and I left mine too as I wasn't happy about using the table even though I had wiped it . We did complain to customer services and got a reply from Ellie it was quite frank and straight to the point it's not their responsibility read the small print we can change your train at any time and and we can't guarantee your seat together even though we paid extortionate price for standard premier , they also didn't have a lot to say about the dirty seats and the table , so basically the check -in lady the train manager and Ellie the customer service manager don't really care about their passengers it's easyJet for me from now on",

        "title": "Eurostar and Eurodespatch: The Foxtons of rail travel",
        "review_text": "EDIT: Eurostar did eventually get in touch and refund the cost of baggage service. \n\nSo, it turns out the Eurodespatch part of Eurostar, which takes sports equipment and heavy luggage, is actually worse than Eurostar itself. Who knew that was possible? \n\nI recently travelled with my bike to Barcelona from London. I left a healthy window of 1hr and 15 between the Eurostar arriving in Paris and my train to Barcelona departing. The Eurostar arrived a bit late, but no worries, I thought, I still had plenty of time to make the connection.\n\nAnd that was when disaster struck. The platform that the Eurostar came in on was undergoing renovation work, with the result that the baggage truck was not allowed onto the platform until all the passengers had cleared.\n\nThis took the best part of 50 minutes (Eurodespatch says you can collect your baggage within 20 mins) and I missed my connection to Barcelona as a result. \n\nThose trains only go twice per day, so I was then forced to spend a night in a hotel in Paris, before continuing on the next morning, almost a day behind schedule.\n\nComplained to customer \"service\", but they haven't bothered to get back to me. \n\nI choose Eurostar because I want to fly less, to do the right thing. It's\nbad enough that they operate a bike carriage service that is far more expensive than any other train company in the EU, and far less convenient than any airline. But to promise the customer they can get their bag back in 20 mins and then completely fail to deliver is even worse. \n\nThey must have known about the ongoing renovation works. They must have known it was causing delays. Why not forewarn the customer and figure out a way to mitigate it? That they failed to do this smacks of incompetence, even callousness. Ultimately I paid a\nnot insubstantial sum for what is obviously a mediocre service, only to find that they fell short of even that low standard. They're basically the Foxtons of rail travel!",

        "title": "Beware when booking connecting travel",
        "review_text": "We've used Eurostar a few times over the years, and apart from a few delays, have enjoyed the experience.  Our opinion has been changed after our recent experience of booking a journey.\n\nA couple of weeks ago on 27/1/20 I made a booking for a journey on 28/3/20 at 8.31am from St Pancras to Moutiers.  I understood that I would have to change stations in Paris and assumed that the Eurostar booking system would factor in enough time to make this journey.  It has given us 55 minutes to get from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon.\n\nAfter conducting some research into the time that it takes to make this transfer it seems that 55 minutes is very tight, other websites recommend a minimum of an hour or more to make this journey.  We'll have ski gear with us so taxi is the only option.  According to Waze and Google the fastest car ride is 20 minutes (in Paris traffic it could easily be more).  On top of this we'll have to queue for a cab and get to the platform and on to the train at Gare de Lyon.  (We are already near the front of the Eurostar so we can get off quickly)  \n\nThis timescale will only work if the Eurostar arrives exactly on time.  I see from the Eurostar website that it is not unusual for trains to be a few minutes late.  If we miss our train at Gare de Lyon there is no other direct train with availability that day- we can wait four hours and then have two changes.  We paid for a direct train from Gare de Lyon.\n\nThere is an earlier Eurostar train on 28/3/20 that leaves St Pancras at 7.52am and arrives at Gare du Nord at 11.25am.  This gives 1 hour and 22 minutes to travel between stations, which seems much more realistic.  This earlier train was not presented to us as a choice when we were booking (we searched St Pancras to Moutiers on the Eurostar website), if it had been we would definitely have chosen it.\n\nI see from the Eurostar website that there would be a charge to change to the earlier train.  Given that we were not given the option of this earlier train when we purchased tickets it seems unfair that we would have to pay this fee.  I was in touch with your customer services via email the day after making the booking to see if there is another way the ticket can be changed to avoid the first day of our holiday being ruined/stressful.  They still haven't got back to me.  \n\nWe booked the Eurostar as we thought it would be a relaxing, fun, environmentally conscious way of making out trip, instead we have been put in the position of very possibly missing our connection or paying \u00a380 to change to a train we didn't know existed.  \n\nI see from a 2017 article in the Telegraph and several travel blogs that these short transfer times have been negatively impacting journeys for years, yet they haven't been sorted out.",

You would think, after all this time, that Eurostar would have realised that there are Oldies in this world and that they have to travel sometimes and that lugging a 15 kg suitcase up these damned steps is just a tad difficult.   I realise that the designers got it stuffed up from the beginning \u2014 because, after all, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out that to have a same-level platform and carriage entrance is quite a good thing for travellers \u2014 but you might imagine that in all these years a solution would have been worked out.  But no, you get in the carriage, totally out of puff from lugging the case up the stairs, then find, of course, that you\u2019re at the wrong end for your seat. This always happens.  \n\nAnd once you find the seat, in cattle-class, of course, because that\u2019s the only way many of us peasants can afford to travel, you realise that Friar Torquemada of the Spanish Inquisition was but a beginner in inflicting discomfort.  Who designed these seats?  Could I introduce him/her/them to those who designed the seats in the Paris to London buses, which are so comfortable even after nine hours of travel? \n\nOne thing, tho :  while you\u2019re waiting to be called on board, the seating at St Pancras and Gare du Nord is so sparse and uncomfortable that it does make you want to get on the train as soon as you can.  There\u2019s usually an upside to every horrible experience.  And the upside to travelling in cattle class Eurostar is getting off that darn train.",

Booked eurostar for 2 adults and a child under 5 (they knew the age since i had to enter date of birth) at booking, and gave gave seat allocation only after payment complete. Shocked to learn that all of us were seated in differnt parts of the train. the child was give a seat out of sight and unsupervised. Having phoned customers, showed no concern or sympathy. they said speak to the station manager on the day to see if any other customers travelling would give up a seat on good will, if not, im afraid theres nothing else we can do.\nhow can they expect to allow a child under 5 to sit on his own, unsupervised and out of sight of his parents. staggering that they have no concern/responsibility of the safety of a child! due to this response, i do not feel safe travelling and cancelled my trip. lost around \u00a3800 for nothing!\n\n\nUpdated: I emailed eurostar 3 days ago as they said they were concerned about my review. so far, no response. I dont think they are concerned and there was probably no point in sending them an email. They just write these comments on here for show. actually, it is evident that nothing is then done about it.",

        "review_text": "Disgusted!\n\nMy daughter turns 17 in April and together with her boyfriend they booked their first ever trip away on Eurostar to Paris combining it with a 2 night hotel stay. This trip was booked some months ago but sadly the relationship has failed and she is left with non-refundable and non-transferable tickets and hotel booking. Her elder sister is now travelling with her and so I appealed to their better nature to see if out of good nature they could change the name on the ticket/hotel booking and we would pay any admin fee. The short answer is they won\u2019t entertain it at all and state we have to make a new booking for her sister. Now how hard would it be just to allow a name change for a fee, instead they want their cake and eat it making us book another seat whilst knowing the original seat will be empty...pure theft is all I can say and hardly inspiring young travellers to ever use their service again. For the Eurostar executives, hope you enjoy your fat cat bonuses from ripping off your customers and for setting the benchmark for customer service at the absolute low point.\n\nAfter contact by Eurostar I can confirm the matter has been resolved it was just a pity it came to making a public complaint!",

        "review_text": "Twee retourtickets Brussel - Londen gekocht voor bijna 600 euro, maar de Eurostar service bij onverwachte tegenslag is nog slechter dan die bij lagekostenluchtvaartmaatschappijen. Mijn Chinese vriendin werd na anderhalf uur visumonderzoek geweigerd aan de Britse grens in Brussel. Wij waren dus even totaal van de kaart. Zij weet niet hoe alleen terug naar Nederland te reizen, spreekt de taal niet en was ontzettend bang. In plaats van dat het Eurostar personeel ons een half uurtje gunt om onze zaken op orde te maken, begonnen ze direct te dreigen. Mijn vriendin's ticket werd uit haar handen getrokken en geannuleerd: 300 euro foetsie. Ik moest van het personeel direct instappen en mijn vriendin alleen achterlaten (huilend) of 49 euro omboekingskosten betalen voor de volgende trein. En als ik die trein zou missen, zou mijn ticket ook worden geannuleerd. Ik heb nog nooit zo'n onmenselijk en onbeschoft gedrag meegemaakt. Dat gedreig terwijl we wel wat anders aan ons hoofd hadden. De volgende keer reis ik gewoon weer met het vliegtuig naar Londen. Zelfde belabberde service, maar 10x goedkoper.\n\nUpdate 9 maart: uiteindelijk bericht gehad en de omboekingskosten teruggekregen.",

Every carriage has only four rows of seats with no view, so to get it on all three trains is not only unacceptable, it\u2019s basically impossible to have been a random event. We certainly paid enough money to be given at least one half decent set of seats! The lovely view of Europe has not been experienced at all. It was the whole reason we took the excruciatingly long (and expensive) journey from London to Amsterdam by train. Add to that some unacceptable delays, awful connections, a connecting train with an incorrect departure time, tickets that wouldn\u2019t allow us through the barriers, and confusing information for passengers in Brussels. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve taken Eurostar and it will most certainly be my last. I repeat what everyone else is saying: just book a flight!",

Went back today and it says that because of a strike there are no trains on the Sunday.  Huh?  What if I had paid for the return a couple of days ago? \nFor an organisation the size of Eurostar, they need to get someone who knows how to run a simple website like theirs properly.\nI think I'll fly or drive.

        "review_text": "Very poor customer services and a company who obviously does not care at all any longer about loyal customers or long term customers. I have travelled with Eurostar literally since it started 25 years ago. Was on the frequent traveller program since the days you used to fax them proof of travel to get points, before their current program. Effectively on program without gap for 25 years. So a long term frequent user. In Oct they tell everyone that the criteria for Carte Blanche has gone up, my program expiry was in Nov. I was already on track to stay on program but they moved the goalposts literally giving me a month to take travel I had not planned or be removed from the program. I could understand if there was decent notice, if my expiry was Oct I would have been on program for another year but as it was nov I was removed from the program due to being just a few points short of the new higher target. I called customer services to explain the odd expiry and ask if there was anything I could do eg transfer points from another program etc and was told no it had to be points from travel. So I had a few weeks to try to resolve it and book a journey.  I could not and would have acted inappropriately had I booked travel that was unnecessary just to get the extra few points needed. The amount was very small. The fact that I faced a new target just before my renewal date was irrelevant to them and re the new target with no notice I was told sorry nothing can be done, I wrote to them as well explaining the odd situation and was told pretty bluntly that no they could not uplift me to the status I was on without taking the appropriate amount of travel. It was as if they had ignored the case and treated me like I had never travelled before. That\u2019s no way to treat customers who have travelled frequently and spent huge sums of money over several years, in fact literally since they started. Since Nov I have had now had 4 journeys into Europe which previously would have been with Eurostar none of which I have now taken with them. I am still travelling just via other routes now Eurostar still have seats available so it seems to me they just lost a good customer for what?",

They got drunker and louder and more abusive as the journey progressed, throwing food, beer cans, and foul language around.  They also talked loudly and inappropriately about the well-known client they'd been to see in Paris.  As a result of my complaint, they were quickly contained by security staff and offloaded into the hands of the police at Ebbsfleet.  Onboard staff took contact details for other passengers and we were all sent a letter of apology and a lovely hamper.\nBoarding at Gare du Nord is a dreadful experience, although I believe it may have improved recently. The French security and passport control staff are surly and unpleasant, a contrast to those at St. Pancras.",

Unfortunately when we arrived at Ebbsfleet station & passed through the turnstiles we each received a yellow slip of paper to inform us that our seat allocations had been changed - we now had two seats together & two people sitting in isolation.\nInitially we raised our dissatisfaction with the customer services lady who told us nothing could be done as the changes were due to a change of train with different seating layout. We then spoke with her manager (Louise Vincent) who said that the changes were made by colleagues in Lille & she couldn\u2019t change them. We were offered a refund but of course this was of no good as we had hotel bookings that were too late to cancel for a refund!!!!!\nEventually the manager said she would check for any \u2018no shows\u2019 once the train had left St Pancras & that she would come to see us in departures with an update - She never came to provide an update.\nWhilst in the departure lounge we raised our concerns with further staff including the operations manager who suggested that we speak to the train manager who may be able to help. We weren\u2019t able to sort a change of seating out so had to travel separated to Brussels - not a good start to our weekend away.\nWhilst on the train I raised a case with Eurostar customer services for which I received an acknowledgement straightaway but three weeks later no actual response.",

The Rudeness of Eurostar staff is also completely unacceptable. Not assisting anyone with basic enquiries. Just barking orders down to the passengers.  Never using this service again.

A week later I get informed that I will received my refund. The amount quoted is only for the train ticket and not for the hotel, which is a joke if I am being expected to pay for that considering the cancellation reason was due to means outside of my control.\n\nI am currently writing this review while trying to phone customer services. I have been on the phone for 50 mins and still going. Despite saying I need to speak to someone regarded packages I have been passed on twice to people who do not handle this so I have been constantly passed around and being on hold etc.\n\nWorst Customer Service I have had the displeasure of having to use",

Ook de communicatie met Eurostar is zeer moeilijk en lastig. Uiteindelijk maar een email gestuurd waar hopelijk een reactie op komt. \nHet concept met Eurostar en de trein is echt goud. Personeel is vriendelijk en behulpzaam maar Eurostar heeft te veel afhankelijkheden met het gebruik van het spoor.\n\nEurostar heeft de ambitie om 40% van de mensen uit het vliegtuig te halen en naar de trein te verplaatsen. Dit gaat ze op deze manier nooit lukken. Ik ben geen fan van vliegen maar de trein is zeker geen alternatief!",

Couldn't do it on the (usually excellent) app for some reason. Ok, it took 30 mins to get through; they must be innundated. But once through the agent immediately identified the issue - I had part paid the ticket with a voucher/promotional fare so it was being funny about me moving it -  she did it for me in 10 seconds. While Eurostar could do with more resilience in their call handling - I doubt this will be the last strike in France! -  their staff are really helpful. I travel regularly with them and  find the service is generally excellent, especially at the St Pancras end. Gare de Nord can be a bit hit and miss. And why don't they have trays to put your stuff in for security like every other international security operation I've ever been through?! The number of times bag straps jam in the conveyer belt must be frustrating! i don't know if Eurostar provide that service themselves - if you do, please sort it out! Last time a confused gentleman picked up my coat!  Ok, so they are not perfect. But I am giving 5 stars for the customer service, the people who try to sort things out for you, and are generally great.",

        "review_text": "On Friday the 22nd of November we took the Eurostar in Brussels without any trouble. However on our way back home on Sunday the 24th of November, we arrived 1 hour before departure but weren\u2019t able to pass through the first ticket-control at St Pancreas.\n\nWhen trying to check-in we were told other people got through the gate with our tickets (same name and same reference numbers). We were seen as frauds! When showing our ID\u2019s, the Eurostar staff could verify we had the same name as the names written on our tickets. We had to wait for the police to arrive, but they never showed. In the meantime, we had to buy new expensive tickets, because there was no way we could get through the gates otherwise.\n\nWe don\u2019t understand when going through three different control gates, nobody checks if the name on your passport/ID matches the name on your ticket. Apparently re-selling your Eurostar ticket is illegal however nothing is done to control this.\n\nIf the staff would have checked if the names on the passports matches the names on the tickets, this situation could have been prevented. Besides, we bought our tickets on the official Eurostar website.\n\nWe made the Eurostar staff aware of our situation and concerns, we asked them if they could check who sat on our original seats so we could reclaim our seats but never got any confirmation on this, instead they obliged us to buy new tickets.\n\nOther than that, we expected a lot more from the Eurostar customer service. They doubted our honesty while we showed them our original tickets with our matching ID\u2019s. We simply don\u2019t understand how such a big and important company shows so little support towards their loyal customers.\n\nApart from buying a new ticket, never were we told any kind of solution. Instead, the \u2018fake\u2019 us got through the gates with our tickets with our names, while we were left behind with frauded \u2013 non-valid \u2013 tickets and the obligation to buy new ones.\n\nMay we mention that on every Eurostar ticket, the Ticket Conditions state: \u2018This ticket can only be used by the person whose name appears on it\u2019.\n\nWe would like to be refunded for our tickets, as this is something we are not responsible for and could have been prevented by a better Eurostar gate policy.",

Staff keeps shepperding customers in absolutely random queues, constantly changing their order.\n\nThe resulting waiting time, for two people arriving at exactly the same time, can vary from 10 minutes to an hour, which in many cases resulted in a missed train. \n\nSuch improvisation, for the routine and daily process of organising queueing, reeks of amateurism from the Eurostar staff and generates unnecessary stress, even resulting in quarrels among passengers over the random ordering of the queues, without the staff bringing any sense of authority or order. \n\nThis is again unfortunately common in Gare du Nord departures, and I hope Eurostar takes this opportunity to better train their staff and implement a clear process for queuing.",

        "review_text": "We have just returned from a trip with friends to Bruges Christmas market and travelled from St Pancras on Eurostar. As this was our first trip to Bruges, let me make my first main point - Eurostar does NOT go to Bruges, it goes to Brussels and then you are on your own how to get to Bruges and back.\nThe signage is abysmal in Brussels and locals agree that the old British Rail is a shining example of helpful customer service when it comes to the Belgian equivalent. As we alighted the Eurostar in Brussels we could not find one sign helping to find a train to Bruges. In fact, a wall mounted timetable indicated a two hour wait, but an information kiosk found quite luckily said \u201c5 minutes over there on platform 9\u201d and we were away!\nPerhaps we were just not trying hard enough and hoped that the return journey would be better having experienced the outward journey, but no, it was worse!. Arriving in Bruges for a return train gives no help for travellers going back to Brussels hoping for the merest mention of a Eurostar related train. We found out that Brussels has several stations, north, south, midi and others but Eurostar give no indication on your ticket purchased in the good old UK which one to head for. Several trains go every hour to Brussels, but watch for the letters IC to give an idea of which will connect to Eurostar, but even then the signage in Brussels for Eurostar in the main railway station is non existent. We googled Eurostar Brussels platform which indicated 1 and 2 as the best bet and headed in that direction to only confirm by reading one tiny departure board that we had found our correct departure point at last and headed with the crowd to Terminal 1. Wow, what a horrid depressing waiting area that Eurostar has for its standard class of customer. Only those able to wait in the Premier Business Class area looked remotely like a well treated and welcome customer and I guess most will have been paid for by our EU Brussels comrades rather than those of us looking for anything other than mouldy dog eared food from the only food outlet and tasteless tea and coffee.\nThis was a depressing journey and will not be repeated. Bruges is a marvellous place to visit, but don\u2019t be fooled by Eurostar into thinking that they get you there and back because they don\u2019t and your ticket should give you the clue when it says London St Pancras to Any Belgian Station!!",

It started in October for everyone so if your membership is due for renewal in November like mine, you don't have time to get the points in unlike if your renewal is in sept 2020. In my case, they tell me I have 3 weeks to spend \u00a3600. I'm not the only complaining about the situation (have a look on twitter).\n\nAfter calling them, they showed zero empathy and kept telling that I had accepted the legal conditions (!).\n\nThe fidelity program keeps getting worse, points are now useless. When you talk to them, it's always for the benefits of their customers. \"We charge you more cause we really care about you\". I don't even use the business lounge, the only useful advantage when you're a carte blanche member is using the fast-track lane. Queues are so long without, it's depressing.\n\nTreat your loyal customers with respect and empathy. \n\nFix your issues:\n- wifi is a joke, we're in 2019\n- the food is terrible on standard premier and the quantity is not enough for a grown up man\n- trains are frequently late and dirty\n- they overcharge you for everything when you want to reschedule a trip\n\nEnjoy your monopoly while it lasts!",

        "review_text": "Travelling back from Disneyland resort Marne la vallee / chessy . After 4 fantastic days what a shambles on Eurostar. First told to turn up over a hour before. Then no one knows what happening ? For over a hour finally after looking on our phones we find out our train has broken down no Eurostar personnel to tell us . Over 300 passengers trying to get through check in the lift is lock so have to carry our buggy down flights of stairs . Now train turns up late and it a free for all everyone like us who had paid for premier seating are told it a different train so anyone can sit anywhere. So out of 7 of us all split up also no food what we had paid for this is how to run a Eurostar service basically  no one could be bothered to stand by the doors and check tickets you had family separated !!! Then told we can claim just go on Eurostar compensation as I paid for seven people on standard premier can I get my money back lol ... it saying we are not recognising your claim what a joke !!!!and now three times I\u2019ve ask for compensation and they keep asking for my new ticket as I said before my train broke down it was a stand in train a free for all anyone could sit anywhere. Please Eurostar I would like my money back for standard premier not to just be ignored!!! We traveled on the 19/10/2019 from Disneyland Paris at 1655 but didn\u2019t leave till 1800 ...\nJust got of the phone to Eurostar WOW just been told there is no evidence of us not being able to sit where we were suppose to sit and basically telling me I\u2019m a liar , and have a 8 pound e ticket to spend on Eurostar.\nThis is how a company works takes over 1000 pounds for all my family so we can sit together in standard Premier for a train to break down and told to sit anywhere but your get compensated, then to be told you won\u2019t as there no record of this and your are liar we will never travel this way again a firm that can keep your money even if they do not provide a service . 300 pounds out of pocket well done Eurostar \ud83d\udc4d",

Name not checked at all on tickets though so no need to rebook a ticket if this happens to you. \n\n* Poor booking system - I believe caused an auto correct mistakes. \n\nI accidentally booked two tickets under my name instead of my name and my boyfriends. I believe it could have been an auto correct error as I spoke to someone on the phone who said that had happened previously. Euro star did not allow me to change the ticket name. I had to book another ticket that cost \u00a3189 plus \u00a310 phone charge. Either their booking autocorrection error (I think this was possible) or I made a stupid mistake that I was charged a lot of money for. Users make mistakes and Euro star should be more considerate of that in their terms and conditions. \n\nVery disappointing user experience. Unless I get a refund (or part refund) I will never use again. But I feel that they do not care if I use it again.",

        "title": "Eurostar's booking system glitches\u2026",
        "review_text": "Eurostar's booking system glitches leads to customers paying exorbitant amounts for its errors.  \n\nI bought a return ticket London-Brussels for 22/08/19 on the first and last trains of the day. However, when I went to scan my return ticket on that day I was told the ticket was for the last train the next day on 23/08/19. I felt gutted and ashamed and being extremely tired because of the very long day trip, with no much battery left on my mobile and with the pressure building up because time was running fast to get the train I wanted, I decided to exchange my ticket for the one I needed and paid 182.50 euros for it. This was a huge blast to my poor economy as my original ticket was \u00a329.\n\nI thought about it and concluded that this wasn't my mistake because when I booked the tickets around 21.05.19 I was looking for the cheapest and earliest journey available and I first checked on 4th August being one day after my birthday, however it was more expensive and at the end I had to take the 22nd August for being the one fitting with those plans. However, I decided to double check because I had seen some prices changed at one point on my search and I went back to check 04.08.19. To my surprise the price was what I wanted; \u00a358 and after double checking everything I clicked on buying.\n\nWhen I received the confirmation email the date booked had changed to the 22.08.19 and I thought 'oh, there must have been a system problem', however, I left it there because I had already tried all possible dates and the first available one for the price I wanted after 04.08 was 22.08. I never checked the return date thinking of course that it had gone back to what I had chosen first; to go and come back on 22.08.19. I never wanted to stay the night in Brussels because I didn't want to pay for accommodation, that means I never ever looked at any ticket after the 22.08. knowing the least I could pay was \u00a358. \n\nUnder these circumstances I don't feel is fair I had to pay for this ticket, I'm very sure I didn't made a mistake as I'm very careful when I book tickets being experienced on travelling with Ryanair. I take time and double check every piece of information I need to fill or confirm. As I say above I booked for 04.08.19 and I received an email with a ticket for 22.08.19 and returning on 23.08.19, I never looked at any return ticket after the 22.08.19, so how could I have got such a ticket? \n\nAfter complaining to the company and getting help from  London Travel Watch, Eurostar refuses to offer any refund or compensation, and there are other people in this page that have experienced similar issues in August. How does Eurostar defend themselves when there have been so many glitches on their system on those dates. \n\nThey argue that as I got an email with the confirmed dates I am the one to blame, but how good is that when the problem is that their booking system doesn't work properly and makes mistakes that customers have to pay for?\n\nFurthermore, we as humans make mistakes for many reasons and Eurostar acting so harshly and taking advantage of passengers' misfortune is cruel and corrupt. They make a fortune selling tickets as they're the only company offering this precious service particularly now that climate change is an emergency and they still punish customers this way. This is brutal and should be made illegal, a mistake should be penalized with a low fee and in the cases I'm talking about it is not even the customers' fault.",

I had a train to Paris at 17h01 on Friday 04 of October 2019, I arrived at 16h25. There was a huge queue for the security control. So I asked to a Eurostar agent to cut off a little the line because I was a little bit afraid about the time. He told me :\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0No, we have closed the gates for this train. You have to go to the ticket office !\u00a0\u00bb. I replied that\u00a0I didn\u2019t understand as the trains was at 17h01. He told me \u00ab\u00a0gates close 30min before, go to the ticket office\u00a0\u00bb. But I arrived 30min before! This agent didn\u2019t have any common sense. I noted this agent then let some customers cut off the line but they were women. It\u2019s unacceptable to be treated differently just because I\u2019m not a woman. \nThe queue for the ticket office was huge because some trains had been canceled. After waiting 30min, an agent asked me : \u00ab\u00a0how can I help you?\u00a0\u00bb. I replied : \u00ab\u00a0I had a train at 17h01, I arrived at 16h25, but an agent told me that the gates are closed\u00a0\u00bb. She told me : \u00ab\u00a0you have missed your train, due to trains canceled we close gates strictly 30min before\u00a0\u00bb. I said : \u00ab\u00a0No I didn\u2019t miss the train I was here strictly 30min before, it\u2019s incredible that I am held responsible for canceled trains. It\u2019s not my problem. I take Eurostar quite often, And got trains even by arriving later than the time I arrived today\u00bb. She didn\u2019t reply at all about my concern. She just repeated what she said before. She told me : \u00ab\u00a0we close gates strictly 30mins before. I will check availability for the next train. You will have to pay 44\u00a3.\u00a0\u00bb. I was shocked to be asked to pay for new tickets when the issue was due to train cancelled by the company! She left, then came back after 5min. She asked me to pay 44\u00a3 then told me : \u00ab\u00a0you can go to the queue for security control, your train is at 18h01\u00a0\u00bb. \nI call that racket! Tickets are already expensive, I payed over 200\u00a3 for these tickets and I had to add 44\u00a3 because they are useless and some trains are cancelled. Again my advise don\u2019t take Eurostar !",

I was obliged to buy a 386 Euro ticket in addition to the one I had already bought, months before.I was told there may have been a techinical problem, they would contact me. They did not, After many mails I was informed they could unfortunately do nothing, as I had had a ocnfirmation mail with the wrong destinations indicated, This is Vulture Capitalism at its worst; heartless and extortionate. I prefer the train to flying. I was even told by customer 'care' in London that my initial cheap ticket \"drove prices up for everyone else' How perverse.These people are clearly rewarded for discouraging traveller complaints.

If you would like to claim the rest of your taxi fare, I would advise you to speak to your travel insurance as they may be able to help with the remainder of the cost. If it would help, I can certainly supply an email with details of your disrupted journey.\n\nPlease accept my apologies once again for the issues you've faced, and if I can help with anything else, please do let me know.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAdam\nEurostar care",

Like something from the third world, floor in a disgusting state, toilet roll everywhere, bins overflowing, suspect substances on the cubicle walls, toilet itself looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.

The Eurostar was late and the crew made a wrong announcement about changes to the subsequent connecting ICE during the ride so that around 150 people were not able to reach the ICE. My girlfriend even went to the train staff to double check their information as there was other information on Deutsche Bahn App. \nInstead of taking any measures to help the stranded people, including families and children, Eurostar didn't do anything, changed their arguments of defense several times, and called instead the police staff to help closing their terminal. Finally they did blame Deutsche Bahn for not being able to communicate properly and one of the managers even shouted at the crowd of 50-60 people to shut up. The only help was to advise to book an hotel on our own cost and to take any train the next day. Thanks for nothing. Never again",

        "review_text": "I do not like to fly so use Eurostar at least annually. I like trains and am happy to travel on them but it costs much more and takes significantly longer than air travel - so why don't train companies do more to make travelling by train more inviting? Particularly at a time when people are becoming much more conscious of their carbon footprint. Eurostar in particular has things going for it but ... Most recently I got the 'direct' service to Avignon. I called Eurostar but was simply referred to their website by someone who sounded like it was really too much effort to speak to me and they were clearly eating as they spoke. On a separate occasion, another less than enthusiastic person couldn't help with questions about the timing of their own services or of local trains so advised me to use Trainline! I did - and sucessfully booked all required tickets including the Eurostar trains I wanted. The service to Avignon was busy (as they all seem to be which surely is a positive that should provoke more change?) and is indeed direct in that you don't have to change in Paris or elsewhere but it stops en route. We arrived way ahead of the recommended time to go through passport control/security for the 07.19 train from St Pancras but it was chaotic with large numbers of passengers boarding trains all departing around the same time. (It is an altogether much smoother and more pleasant experience from Ebbsfleet but the service we wanted did not operate from there). The process was very slow and despite the extra time we had allowed we pretty much only just boarded our train on time with very little opportuniity to grab food/drinks for the long journey. On board offerings are totally over priced and inadequate in every way possible. Why don't they just sub contract to Pret a manger or similar? Also, why do they say there is free Wifi when there simply never is? Over the years there seem to be less staff on board and none of them I saw this time were particularly welcoming and once seen were then invisible barring litter collectors who appeared once in both directions and were great. We had to stop and disembark at Lille on the return trip for passport control x2 and security which no one tells you about beforehand (the tickets tell you to arrive at least 45 mins before departure for security etc - which we did - but this was unnecessary because there is no security at Avignon). Again, a laborious - but I accept necessary - process and all staff involved were excellent. The trains were exactly on time which was great and made up for a previous occasion when we were left stranded in Paris with an armed policeman at the Eurostar information point and not a member of staff in sight! I want to travel by train - and I have ventured as far as Venice so far - but nothing much ever seems to be done to make it an altogether more conducive experience. I know Eurostar is only one part of this but they could do much more in leading the way.",

Was going to write to Eurostar to explain why my ticket not used and ask for part refund, but as soon as I typed their ticket number on to the web page, a notice came up that I was entitled to a full refund, and a voucher for this amount arrived the next day.   OK it was not cash, but I use Eurostar regularly,  so the voucher was fine. \n\nAt least Eurostar acknowledged the travel chaos, which was probably not their fault, and offered immediate compensation.",

Which had me walking aimlessly round Lille for over 2 hours. I have received a email informing me that I will receive a partial refund has my train was 132 minutes late. Even though this was the case, they have not taken into account I arrived into Brussels FIVE hours later then planned!! Which surely should be taken into account as the service I paid for ( which was not cheap) was a direct train from London to Brussels!!!",

None of the staff said anything about why! Also the food was more like snacks. It was so small even the drinks. Dont buy a ticket for this train. It advertises with that its better than a plain, but its rly not! \nUnless you wanna support trains who believes they have the right to not tell their passengers why they are 2 hours delayed dont buy one of their overpriced tickets!",

Op de terugrit had de trein echter heel wat vertraging meer dan 1u15 waardoor we de laatste bus en trein naar huis hadden gemist. Geen probleem zei het eurostar personeel we regelen alles omdat de trein meer dan een uur vertraging had en het openbaarvervoer geen optie meer is mag je met de taxi gaan en eurostar betaald alles terug. Dus taxi genomen met een gerust hart dat alles in orde was en eurostar me zou vergoeden voor de taxi. Echter toen ik vroeg aan eurostar de volgende dag om me terug te betalen zeiden ze het volgende:De trein had slecht 59 min vertraging en we vergoeden pas van 60 min. Ik weet niet hoe zij aan de 59 min komen dat wouden ze mij ook niet vertellen misschien rekenen ze vanaf dat je in de zone van aankomst komt en niet wanneer de trein effectief stopt en je kan uitstappen. Maar het geen me het meeste stoorde is dat het personeel dan tegen ons gelogen heeft dat alles terug betaald ging worden. Als ze van het begin eerlijk waren geweest was het anders maar liegen dat ze de taxi betalen om achteraf te zeggen van niet is gewoon misleidend en triest dat ze het spel zo spelen",

The website is easy to use to book tickets, you can change your assigned seats if you prefer, and you can check for delays via live departures on their website. When there are problems I have always found these dealt with efficiently. I received an email last year when my train was cancelled due to weather related damage repairs and was able to book onto the following train within half an hour using live chat. All those passengers who arrived at the station not knowing about the cancellation were rescheduled onto the next train in a quick and well organised manner with no queuing, I was very impressed. \nSurely people booking bargain non- refundable tickets without travel insurance must know by now what this means, so I find the poor reviews complaining about inflexibility unfair. Also, yes it is NOT cheaper than flying, but why should it be? I travel by train because I care about my carbon footprint and because I find it much more relaxing. I find Eurostar trains are safe, quick, comfortable and mostly on time. Unlike air travel, they get you into the heart of the city. Last time I arrived in London I caught my onward train at Waterloo within half an hour of disembarkation. You won\u2018t achieve that landing at Gatwick or Heathrow!",

While eventually passing through security she continued shouting repeatedly \"next time you pack your bag lighter so you can lift it\". Pretty disgusting when I have just told her I have an injury and physically, can not lift. I was so embarrassed and almost in tears not to mention furious. It was abusive behaviour.

        "review_text": "We recently travelled to Lyon on a package booked through Eurostar having booked the weekend including hotel .\n\n The first problem occurred in the transfer from Gard du Nord to Paris Lyon. Thier timings do not leave enough time. You need at least an hour and a half for the tranfer time due to taxi queues ( we are pensioners and cannt deal with the metro) and the ongoing road works at Place de la Bastille. Eurostar gave us 40 minutes. Thanks to a brilliant taxi driver who almost drove us onto the platform We got the TGV with a minute to spare which left us completely stressed.\n\nThe onward ticket from Paris Lyon ended at Lyon Par Dieu. Then we paid \u20ac20  to get to our hotel. Which was 100 yards from the next station that the train called at!!!! We only discovered this when our hotel receptionist told us when we tried to book a taxi to go home. Our seat was booked so we were able to get on at Lyon Parrache. Why did Eurostar not know this?\n\nWe booked a superior room at the hotel Charlemagne. Eurostar booked us a regular room. The hotel were happy to change us however.\n\nWe will travel Eurostar trains again as they are the easiest way to get where want to despite thecstinking toilets. But as a travel operator we can do better ourselves.",

        "title": "Drunkenness common on Eurostar",
        "review_text": "On Thursday, May 16, 2019, I traveled with my family from London to Brussels on a 8:55 AM Eurostar train (which was 73 minutes late departing). During this trip, we had a terribly uncomfortable experience involving 5-6 men who chose to hang around the cafe area drinking rounds of beer and chatting about highly inappropriate topics so loudly that the entire coach could hear them at 10 in the morning. You'll see from this video that one of the men asked another if an acquaintance's \"tits are real\" to which he responded, \"yes - oh I speak from experience\". You'll also hear them saying the f word at least 3-4 times. \n\nYou'll notice that this is only two minutes of their conversation, but I'd be happy to fill you in on the other 60+ minutes, which included their blowjob experiences, how their penises felt during these experiences, their sexual encounters with various women, and at several times, loud banging and demeaning comments towards women and gay men. I estimate they said the f word more than a hundred times between all of them. As they were hanging around the cafe area with an automatic door, it was inevitable that the door opened numerous times unnecessarily and several of them made it a point to make uncomfortable eye contact with me - I'm a petite woman who was sitting with my parents and boyfriend by the cafe area.\n\nThe man serving them at the cafe area did nothing to ask them to quiet down their conversation or move the area, though it was clear they were being very inappropriate among children, families, and the elderly. A member of our family would have asked the man to kindly ask them to leave, although due to a similar experience the day prior, we were forced not to as it wouldn't make a difference (while traveling from Paris to London, there were men hanging in the area speaking very loudly, and we told the man at the cafe, and he told us to get up and move; we then told the train manager and he said nothing to the guys at the cafe but instead moved us to another coach and separated our family, so it's clear telling staff we were uncomfortable only had staff place the blame on ourselves as staff cannot control 6 drunk men). We would have also kindly asked the guys to quiet down, but they were becoming more drunk and we did not want to make a scene with irrational men - we also asked the guys in the previous day's trip to keep it down but they laughed at us and kept on more loudly with their conversation.\n\nThis trip made us feel helpless. We did not pay hundreds of dollars to have to hear conversations like this from people being served beer after beer to have staff just allow it without the consideration of an entire coach. People from other seats in the coach kept looking back at the cafe area and were clearly offended. I'm sure some were even scared to go into the area surrounded by 5-6 aggressive drunk men, I know as a petite woman, I was. It was an extremely uncomfortable experience that clearly your staff did not want to do anything to remedy. I'm deeply saddened by the experiences I've had on my first Eurostar trips and will consider alternative options before ever choosing Eurostar again. I will also be sharing this experience with my friends and family so they can reconsider traveling with Eurostar if these are the types of experiences you allow on your trains.",

I've had several poor experiences with Eurostar the worst being them taking unauthorised payments from my credit card that took 8 phone calls, talking to 8 different people to sort out.\n\nNow it is pretty much impossible to buy tickets online. You get to the payment authorisation stage and every time, every single time, they say they can't take payment.\n\nSo I called to find out why. The reason? You have to use certain particular browsers in order for the website to complete the authentication process. Firefox is no good, Safari is no good. Apparently it has to be IE (!!!) or Chrome. So they know this, but they don't say that anywhere during the purchase process and just let customers flounder through their antiquated processes.\n\nSo I've had enough. I'm just gonna fly between London and Paris now even though the actual train service is really quite good. I can't buy tickets using browsers that every, single, other, company I deal with online has no problems adapting to, and in addition the awful online and telephone customer service, I'd rather put my money elsewhere. \n\nI'm done. Too much disappointment with this online joke.",

They're always helpful and it's nearly always a positive experience. If booked in advance it's not too expensive, and you only have to be there 45/60 mins before the train leaves. Honestly could not recommend enough, especially as a frequent traveller as you get points which add up to free trips after a while. You're always informed of any (very rare) delays and compensation is easy if things are delayed dramatically. Will never fly to Belgium /France /Amsterdam again.",

        "review_text": "Eurostar is a fantastic company, they're clearly very customer centric and genuinely care about their customers - many little details, throughout the journey, are a testimony to that: good looking trains, comfy seats, lovely free magazine, quirky (cash) bar selection, etc. And for those who can afford an upgrade the standard premier service is very attentive.\n\nHowever... While it's great to be looking forward as a business and pushing some very fun marketing, they seem to forget sometimes about the basics of their product, which is disappointing.\n\nFor instance:\n\n> the queuing system in Paris Gare du Nord is la merde. I appreciate the added security, etc. This does not explain why the parked crowds are so poorly managed. I have witnessed, on several occasions team members contradicting each other, or just not enforcing their own instructions, resulting in a waste of time for literally dozens if not hundreds of people.\n\n> It would be good also if the trains could be a little cleaner. I appreciate that said trains are in high rotation and there's a lot of traffic, but when you pay an average of \u00a3150 in standard class for what remains, for all its bells and whistles, a train journey, I will argue that it's reasonable to expect that train to be clean?",

        "review_text": "What has happened! Having travelled with Eurostar on the snow train and having had a good experience I was expecting the same on the relatively short London to Paris route. \nOn Saturday 20th April 2019, my young daughter, husband and I arrived in plenty of time to catch the 16.04, on which we were booked. I asked staff upon my arrival at the station and seeing the large crowed already, if we get through, they assured me we would. It was 28c in Paris my young child needed the toilet but had to hold on,we had no water and nobody explained what the delay was. We had to queue for nearly 2 hours to get through check in and security. People were pushing and become frustrated, the staff in the station did not handle the crowed well. My daughter who is only young felt frightened and extremely anxious about missing the train. When we finally got to check in we were issued another ticket, being told the train configuration had changed. Then announcements were made that they were holding the train, a relief as we were rushing back for Easter holiday dinner with our family that evening. However when we finally got through to the platform area at 16.23 there were no staff, no announcements, no information at all!!! We were left to rush around (including a young boy who was travelling on his own!) and guess as to where our train was?\nI approached a desk and was greeted by an extremely rude member of staff who curtly told me the train had gone and then ignored me! I was eventually seen and booked onto the 17.07, therefore making my original departure over 60 minutes delayed. We given no explanation, no apology just another seat where my husband had to sit separately to my daughter and I. Who by now was in tears after her ordeal and then finding the train had not waited and that she was going to miss her family Easter meal.\nI am applauded at the terrible customer service that we all received at all points with Eurostar.\n\nWe missed our family meal as our connecting train did not tie up with our original arrival time and this is something you cannot change, sadly.\n\nFinally when I tried to log onto the system to claim a evoucher for the delay I was not able to! This has really been the last straw!\n\nWhy would you treat customers in this way?\n\nNow I see from the many, MANY appalling reviews of the company that the fact they have still not got back to me regarding my complaint (even though their policy clearly states they will in just 2 working days!) this should not be a surprise. \nIn this day when we are looking for better ways to travel Eurostar should be a beacon. \nI shall be calling on the government to seriously review why this company still has the contract to run this service. They clearly have little regard for customer care, professionalism or product development.\nHave decided to follow this up with my local politician, as its local election time!\n'Resolve' website also has some good information and worth looking at (can't post links sadly).\nFinally I will be in contact with the ORR.\nWe can't allow these companies think they can treat us in this way! i work really hard for my wage, my family mean the world to me and holidays are supposed to be a happy, relaxed experience...well not if you travel with Eurostar!",

Went to Euro Disney for Easter weekend and thought we would try Eurostar \n\nThe journey is rocky  and bumpy , the train also tilts to one side for long periods  . The train keeps  slowing right down , then speeding up . Also stopping and starting . Held up for 20 mins because of signal problems or because a train ahead is stuck in a station . The air con on the train is useless , the air in the train is stuffy and putrid . Within 20 mins of leaving all the toilets are filthy and the suction flush stopped working  . You have to walk though loads of carriages to get to the snack bar and there the tea and coffee is disgusting with almost no choice of snacks . On a plane. The speed is consistent and  barring the odd bit of turbulence it is smooth ,  the stewardess brings you a drink , the toilets are continually cleaned , the air con keeps the air so fresh , many people ask for a blanket\n\nA flight to Paris takes 55 mins. our journey home with Eurostar took 4 hours . Then there is the price , it is cheaper to fly \n\nAll in all a horrendous experience , tried it once . Never again \n\nForgot to mention , anybody thinking it is like a normal train with more leg room than a plane , forget it . Seats are the same as a budget airline company . Same leg room",

        "review_text": "SHOCKING DISREGARD OF CLIENTS\n\nI travelled on the Eurostar to Paris then Lyon. It was during the work to rule in early March. I was due to return on the 8th March but at midday on the 7th was texted by Eurostar to be told not to travel on the 8th due to disruption. I went onto the internet site and booked a return for the same day. I had to lose a day's holiday and re-pay for a new trip from Lyon to Paris. The rest of the story is too horrific and long to state in full. Anybody that travelled on the 7th from Paris -shunted like cattle to Lille-then arriving early the next morning in St.Pancras will know how we were treated by Eurostar.\n\nMy complaints were initially ignored by their customer services so I wrote a registered letter. It was finally acknowledged telling me it was basically all my fault that I chose to travel back immediately. It was my fault I chose to cut short my holiday and I was only entitled to a small rebate in the form of a voucher for further travel on Eurostar. Firstly I would never again travel on these crowded dirty trains paying for the privilege of being treated like cattle. \n\nSecondly to anybody reading this, think very very carefully about travelling on the Eurostar. They do not care, customer service is non-existent and you will have no rights whatsoever in case of disputes. The service is poor and will not improve as staff is completely un-interested. French Customs will increase industrial action until the Brexit question is settled. AVOID PLEASE",

This isn't the fault of the agents on the phones or staff in the trains, they do not create policy or rules. 30% of job titles in the Eurostar leadership team have 'customer' in them, unfortunately this is just a parody of reality, contemporary management speak. Being customer driven is really hard, far easier to be mediocre and take advantage of a route dominance. My business travel experience mirrors many of these one star reviews, a shame as Eurostar really could be great and really should be better.",

I now will have to hurry into Centraal just to catch a train in the opposite direction. I was told if I try to board at Schiphol my ticket would be void and I would be refused boarding. I asked to upgrade my ticket, no again. I may just walk away from the $302.00 ticket with Euroscare and take a flight direct from Schiphol.

Booked a trip to Paris and on the very same day turned out one of passengers can't go so we will take someone else instead. Contacted them immediately - they can't do it! You have to rebook the whole trip for 3 people (pay around \u00a3700) and then they will kindly issue a refund for another \u00a3700 worth of tickets you originally bought. This will only take around 28 days to reach your account! Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to just refund 1 passenger\u2019s ticket or change a name (I would be ok to pay for it) ? \u2013This company have to be either acquired by Virgin or someone else. For the people who had as bad experiences as me you can put a complain through official site associated with MoneySavingExpert, it goes directly to Eurostar (not that they responded to me at all, it has been 10 days now!). Here's a link : www resolver co uk \nMaybe if we all flood them with complains they finally wake up - or is it just my wishful thinking....",

        "title": "Racism aboard Eurostar",
        "review_text": "Hey Eurostar team,\n\nMy name is Paul. I am a frequent traveller on the Eurostar. I live and work in Amsterdam but all my friends and family live in London. I travel with Eurostar almost weekly. Usually with exceptional service and professionalism. \u2028\u2028However last nights journey was anything but that. I had booked a standard premier ticket returning to Amsterdam from London. I boarded the train as soon as possible and took my seat. It was a seat located at a table of 4. It was a relatively empty carriage and I was eventually joined by 3 other people. I had the isle seat. The lady that was meant to be sat next to me asked if I could change seats with her as she wanted to be opposite her husband. I kindly obliged. Then the lady opposite me asked if I could move seats as its an empty carriage because she too wanted to be sat opposite her husband, once again I kindly obliged. I noticed behind me that there was a cabin that was empty in the same carriage I was sat in. So I sat there. \n\nAfter a slightly chaotic start to the journey I was finally sat down relaxing in my premier seat. This is where things took a dramatic turn for the worst. About 40 minutes into the journey 2 members of staff informed me that I was not allowed to be there. They had given me no explanation at this point. They had not checked my ticket, they just very aggressively said I was not allowed to be there. After asking what was happening the train manager came rushing into the small cabin shouting furiously at me. Telling me I had no right to be there. Telling my I don\u2019t belong there. He then screamed at me to get out and sit in my original seat. I gathered my belongings and proceeded to return to my original seat that I had kindly given up so a woman could sit with her husband. Upon returning to my original seat I started speaking to the lady that was sat there, the train manager then started shouting at me telling me not to bother the people that had paid to sit in premier. I was very confused at this point. The lady serving the food told me to just take a seat in an empty chair. So I did. \n\nThey continued to serve the food but they failed to serve me. After about 5 minutes the train manager and the lady serving the food proceed to point and have a very aggressive conversation in french about me. From the little French I speak. I understood that he was instructing her not to serve me as I didn\u2019t \u201cbelong here\u201d. They eventually checked my ticket and realised that I was in fact meant to be there as it was the ticket I paid for. \u2028\u2028I was treated with the utmost contempt. I was made to feel humiliated and treated like a criminal who had snuck his way into the premier area. \u2028\u2028I can see no other reason as to why the train manager would have treated me like that other than racism. All he saw was a young brown male with a beard and instantly cast judgement on me. He deemed that \u201cI didn\u2019t belong and that I wasn\u2019t suppose to be there.\u201d\u2028\u2028After about 10 minutes I asked a member of staff as to what the train Managers name is. She informed me that \u201cshe did not know\u201d. The train manger then aggressive approached me and asked why I was looking for him . I informed him I would like his name as I would be putting in a formal complaint. He told me his name is Wim and refused to give me his second name or any other means of identifying him. \n\nIt was not until after Brussels where I noticed the crew had changed I spoke to a different train manager. I told her the situation and she was appalled by what had happened. She apologised and gave me the information I needed. \n\nThe train manager that racially profiled and discriminated against me was called:\n\nWim \n\nTrain 9150\n\nTrain from London to Amsterdam 5:19pm 24/03/2019.\n\nBest,\n\u2028Paul",

When we arrived at King's Cross at 1.00am from Coventry for the 5.40 train (later train not possible due to lack of overnight services) we found no waiting area and it was probably one of the coldest nights this year. This is unacceptable to 65 and 66year olds waiting on a metal bench in the freezing cold for 4hours. We both ended up with severe colds and flu for our holiday. Then we missed all our connections down to Genova in Italy and ended up staying overnight in Turin thanks to SNCF who ensured our safety, as there was no other train to Genova until the following day. \nThen when we went to book our return with Eurostar the prices were ridiculously high so we took the ferry from Calais which was a delight. Needless to say our experience of the Eurostar will not happen again as we won't be using it!\nNot only should they refund the entire ticket but they should pay compensation for the stress we endured.",

But we can't check in, we can't print boarding passes BUT they won't give us a refund. \n\nHonestly this company is the worst ever. They should be stripped of their monopoly position and replaced with an ethical, competent company.\n\nThanks for a great start to the half term eurostar! Having no train at all is at least a change from the usual broken toilets, reassigned seats 3 carriages away from our children and massive unnecessary queues at security as they aren't properly staffed.",

If that wasn't bad enough they even charged our two children adult prices, they said that all the children's seats had gone, how you run out of children's seats on a train I have no idea!!!! \nI would have been quite happy to pay a small rebooking charge, but \u00a3900, shame on you for treating passenger's in this way. \nI have used Eurostar for over 10 years and have been late for trains before, on those occasions my family and I were simply put on the next available train,  so BEWARE, not any more.

        "title": "Awful Mistaken Transaction Policy & Even Worse Customer Service. 82% awful can't be wrong",
        "review_text": "OK I made a mistake. I booked a train from London to Paris instead of London to Lille. It was a silly mistake. I had been booking different journeys and making different searches and I got mixed up. As soon as I pressed the button to buy I realised my mistake and FOUR (yes four) minutes later I called Eurostar hoping to get a simple rectification.\n\nWould the customer services person issue a simple refund so that I could go back in (online) and make the same transaction a few minutes later? No chance. \n\nI was told that I would have to pay a \u00a310 fee and they would rebook my train and any difference in fare would NOT be refunded.\n\nThe rebooking took forever. \n\nNow this is NOT the first time I have done this.  80% of my purchases are done online so I am bound to make a mistake here and there. But every other company I have dealt with has, without flinching, refunded my money immediately if I have called then within the house and I have gone back in and purchased the correct fare straight away. And Im talking the likes of Virgin Trains. British Airways. German Trains dB. Even LOT airways (who have some pretty terrible customer service). \n\nBut not Eurostar. \n\nIt took an email to customer services, their press department and some top bod a few days AFTER I had paid the fees to get my money back. \n\nThe way the letter was written, I was meant to feel grateful that they had made an exception. \n\nBlimey.\n\nAnd to be honest, it wasn't really the money. It was the principal. \n\nI vaguely remember reading somewhere that there is a cooling off period for online purchases. \n\nHowever, forgetting that, surely all companies should put into place a 'common sense' period. If a customer calls up four minutes (or even an hour or so) after mistakenly booking a product online (eg a ticket), it is obvious it is a mistake and common sense should prevail. \n\nIt wasn't until i saw eurostar's 82% terrible customer service score did I realise that many others were no happy with the way the company deals with its customers. \n\nMaybe they should have a serious rethink. \n\nOr maybe they need competition on the cross channel rails to wake them out of their slightly arrogant customer service slumber",

When you flush the toilet you get blue water splashing up at you - ruined my white shirt! Often run out of paper or are totally blocked (that's before the train has even left the station).\n\nPricing is terrible - why should a ticket cost \u00a3300 if somebody wants to travel at short notice or buy it at the station, when they sell others for \u00a329.

They offered no solution, no refund, no exchange without having to pay the penalty. I will not risk mine and my partners life by travelling to Paris particularly when the FCO have advised against it. \n\nThe first person I spoke to didn't even know about the Riots in Paris or the recent fatalities from them. \n\nAppalling customer service. Ruined my weekend, ruined my evening. Had me in tears. Worst Riots in 50 years and Eurostar couldn't give a damn about their customers safety or their fears.

And by locking their gates 30 minutes before train departure (even though it takes 5min to go through security & walk to the train from check-in), they make customers miss their train and get them to buy another pair of tickets, even though they have spare seats on the next train and it is a result of their poor queue management that customers lose their train.\n\nScam & total lack of respect and care for the customer.",

To my surprse they probably forgot to tell me that the office was closed and I would have to wait for the next morning (hours after the connecting trains would have operated again).\n\nWhen contacted the company online they mentioned that \"You have an Any Dutch station and as such, you are entitled to take any service (except the Thalys) from Brussels to Amsterdam, or other Dutch cities. As such, the only time we can show on your ticket is the departure time from London and the arrival time in Brussels. Your ticket is valid for 24 hours and on this booking we don't guarantee that you will have have a direct connection from Brussels to Amsterdam. The booking shows that it is not a Direct train from London to The Netherlands. We are sorry to read that you were stranded in Brussels but we are not in the position to offer you any compensation for this, as we have offered you the service which was agreed when you have bought your ticket.\" \n\nFirstly, I personally never mentioned a compensation.Secondly, I went through the website in much detail and there is no mention of 24hrs ticket validity, a non guarantee that one will not arrive ones destination on the same date booked, and yes it does say direct.  \nOn top of that, when you choose LON- Amsterdam it clearly states which trains are directs and which not, and there are no given options after 17:00. Whereas, when you choose LON-Any Station in The Netherlands two more option pop up (late trains that do not connect) and they say that they re all direct. \nHOW DIFFICUTLT IS TO WRITE OVERNIGHT STAY? WHY DOES A COMPANY KEEPS MISSTREATINGS ITS CLIENTS LIKE THAT? #eurostar",

I recently booked a return trip London to Bruges for my Boyfriends 40th birthday, when I went on the website it gives you the option to select your destination as Bruges...one would normally expect that the destination you have selected would relate to the arrival and departure times.  I then spoke to a friend who then told me that this is just to Brussels and you have to get another train.  I then went back and looked at the small print and sure enough it does say but I think it is a bit of a marketing trick and false advertising to give you the option to select bruges on their website as your final destination if they do not actually take you there.  I called up and politely asked to change my return ticket as with what I now knew it was going to mean leaving far earlier then i had expected.  They said they  would still need to charge me change fees, I said I understood I would need to pay the difference in fair but as it allowed me to select Bruges as my final destination I feel that this is something they need to look at to avoid people making the same mistake again.  Anyway, they were completely unreasonable and showed no kind of compromise or understanding and actually just insinuated that I was stupid.  Yes it explains it all in the small print but in this day and age when booking a train / flight by a 'reputable' company you would expect the time on the ticket to correspond with the destination city that you selected on the booking platform.  Rude and unhelpful staff, I wish I had self driven and gone on the shuttle instead.  I will avoid them in the future",

From their shockingly bad service (with the exception of a few), this is probably the worst form of travel I have ever had. \n\nDuring the hottest summer this year, on one trip I was refused ice for my drink and the reason \"No sir, we need to keep that for those who order alcohol\". \n\nAnother incident there was a 3hr delay, in the same summer, with no explanation other than \"Sir, it's delayed, what do you want me to do?\". \nDuring this 3hr delay, no refreshments, nowhere to sit, because you were not allowed in the waiting area and to top it off, I was provided with a \u00a320 refund on the ticket. UK you would be entitled to the full amount.  \n\nMost recently, I had an issue with booking a return ticket. Arriving in Paris at 9:20am with the return on the same day at 10am. In other words I people travel 2hrs 30mins from London on a train for a visit to Paris for to wait for 30mins and head back. Regardless of whether this was human or computer error, you would think common sense would prevail.....not with this idiotic company. \"Buy a new ticket it's full price last minute \u00a3240\". \n\nWhat is worse, you don't get any response from their customer service, try email, tweet, phone (if you can find one), mail (if you can find one), pigeon, smoke signals. \n\nIt seems that Eurostar doesn't need to adhere to any laws and are run by morons which are approved by even bigger morons. So much for EU law, I've almost converted to being glad to be leaving the EU!!\n\nSTAY AWAY. FLYING ACTUALLY TAKES ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND IT'S SOOOOO MUCH CHEAPER. \n\nI'm certainly done with this pathetic excuse for service company. I'd like to apologies to the Airline industry that I left you and would graciously appreciate if you could welcome me back!!",

        "review_text": "Get this! - I was in Paris today for meetings. I had booked my return journey on the 15.13 to London. Having finished my meetings I went to Gare du Nord and arrived at approx. 14.48 - 25 minutes before departure. \nAt the gate my ticket did not work, I informed the attendant who informed me that the ticket gates close 30 minutes prior to departure and therefore I had missed the train. The departure gates were not busy and when I asked for discretion, I was refused and informed to buy a new ticket. \nI then went to the ticket office, showed my tickets and informed the Eurostar staff of the situation. The salesperson told me I had to buy a new ticket for 49Euro to get the next train. Frustrated, I explained that my work had paid GBP 109 for the 15.13 ticket and I saw no reason for the extra payment - at this, the salesperson said they would rip up my original ticket, which would mean a price of 250EURO to purchase a standalone ticket. I found this approach appalling - \"buy it or else\" - , and reticently bought a ticket for the 16.13 for 49 EURO. \nI then went through passport control and security, and walked to the departure lounge. As I walked past two Eurostar staff they called after me, when I turned they presumed I was there for the 15.13 and said I should go to the platform quickly as the last call had been issued. I then went to the platform, and boarded the 15.13, THE TRAIN I HAD ORIGINALLY BOOKED A TICKET FOR. I had time to walk down the platform and take the seat of my original booking. \nTo cut a long story short, I followed up on this, expecting an apology or refund, and Eurostar staff were aggressive and threatening throughout. It should be noted that at every step they disempower their customers. In this instance, I believe Eurostar have found a dishonest way to make extra revenue and the consumer has no choice of alternative service provider - you make your case, but they just don't care as they have no competing service on the line.",

        "review_text": "The most appalling customer service I've ever experienced in my life. I'll never travel with EuroStar again. I'd rather walk!!\n\nA few weeks ago I suffered a *SIX AND A HALF HOUR DELAY* with EuroStar. Arriving into London at ***03:30am***. \n\nThe conditions were awful. It was hot and uncomfortable.\n\nCustomer service at the time was shocking. I only saw the Train Manager once during his single walk through the carriages, and he could barely take the time to speak to me. What did we get during the ordeal? A *CUP* of water (not even a bottle) if we walked to the cafe cart ourselves, and a fun-size twix each!\n\nThat was shocking enough, but the customer service afterwards was even more appalling. So there's a sliding scale for compensation in this type of case right? Between an hour and two+ delay. But when something goes catastrophically wrong do you think the company should maybe take that into consideration? A six and a half hour delay is exceptional and something deserving of a special handling. EuroStar don't seem to think so.\n\nI had to contact EuroStar multiple times to get my claim paid out as well. They only paid the percentage of the tickets originally, even though they had promised to refund our taxis.\nThe biggest insult...get this... Whilst I put my Mum into a taxi, I took the night tube home. The train manager even suggested we do this. I thought I'd be considerate and do it, since I could get home that way. It felt like travelling home with zoo animals, it was horrendous. So, I don't get indoors til gone 5am right. \nEuroStar refuse to pay my *****\u00a32.80***** tube fare!!\nCompassion?\nCustomer Service?\nAlien terms to these corporate jobsworths\n\nThis is an exceptional circumstance, I get that. For that exact reason alone EuroStar should be grovelling, saying 'usually we're really good, here, let me do anything to prove to you that when things go catastrophically wrong you can count on us. Please ride with us again'.\nThis type of handling would be a stroke of genius, promoting word of mouth recommendations of admiration that whilst it was an ordeal, they make sure you're sorted if something really off the scale from a normal delay happens.\nInstead, they're quoting rules of carriage to me and making me waste my time, and producing the most annoyed and frustrated customer ever.\n\nI literally tell anyone and everyone about how crap the trip was, how bad the service has been, and go into every single detail and communication I've had; there's not been a single person not shocked and appalled. I don't think I'm the only person that'll be put off ever using EuroStar after hearing my story.\nFor a company that spends millions of pounds on advertising, they can't even spare \u00a32.80 of good-will for someone that's been so put out.\n\nYou couldn't pay me to go on EuroStar again. They don't deserve my money!",

        "review_text": "Zero customer flexibility or understanding.\n\nI have used Eurostar over a 100 times. Lately, the trains have been late several times and there are all kinds of issues with queues and boarding delays.\n\nBut, given the convenience of the central stations, I have never previously considered alternative transport. I am seriously doing that now.\n\nGiven all the queuing issues and delays, I have never once seen the 30 minute rule regarding boarding cut off being enforced. \n\nA few days ago, we were only 2 minutes late and that really was due to bad luck: sick girlfriend (I carried her bags), metro delays and, last but not least, the  usual escalator/staircase that gave access to the gate had completely changed location to the opposite end of Paris Gare du Nord.\n\nThe female staff member at the gate was very rude. She agreed our Monday evening train was relatively empty. Visibly, 2-3 people were still going through security so that all she had to do was allow us in. She agreed that she could but that rules were rules. To my point  that rules could be augmented by a bit of human flexibility, she retorted that I should stop arguing  or she'd make me pay in excess  of 200 euros per person for a brand new ticket instead of the additional fee.  \n\nShe stated that 30 minutes or less before the departure, seats were reallocated or re-sold. This may be true but that makes no sense. Does that mean then that a person buying a last minute ticket is exempt from the 30 minute rule? I even suggested that in that case I pay the admin fee to get on our original train but she'd stopped listening at that point.\n\nWe were desperate to get back asap and Eurostar was completely uncaring. \n\nI don't really care about the money as I am fortunate on that level but this is about humanity and treating your customers with respect.\n\nAttempts post-journey to make Eurostar Customer Service show some humanity have also proved futile.\n\nAll in all, a very sour taste in the mouth and zero desire to ever use again. It's so bad that, despite the airplane hassle, I'd rather fly.",

        "title": "Awful Eurostar, find another way to travel.",
        "review_text": "Apologies for the lengthy review but it is important I tell you everything.  \n\nIn July this year, never having travelled with Eurostar before and having read the ticket options, we were sold on the upgrade options of their Business Premier class ticket travelling from Brussels to London Saint Pancras.  (Trustpilot won't allow the abbreviation for Saint, it thinks it's a rude word) \n\nWe were really looking forward to experiencing what was advertised as a great experience and to begin with, the Business Lounge at Brussels seemed to indicate we were in for a treat, however, aside from being greeted at the lounge entrance, we were then left to find a seat/table and had to work out what was on offer.  It would have been nice if someone had shown us around and explained what was available to us.\n\nWe grabbed a coffee and pastry and not long after an announcement told us to board the train.  When leaving the lounge, we were swept up in large crowd all rushing to find a seat, it was difficult to work out which way we had to go to find our carriage.  Eventually we spotted a sign and were swept along by the massing crowd.  When we arrive on the platform, it was very difficult to see the carriage numbers, hidden behind the carriage windows on a small, unlit, digital numbered screen.  Not to worry we found it.\n\nWhen boarding the train, we found the steps difficult to navigate with one large heavy suitcase and two smaller ones.  Despite struggling, there was no help was offered by train staff and other passengers blocking the doorway, whilst looking at which newspaper/magazine they wanted to read, didn't help.\n\nWhen we found our seats, we were horrified to find that leg room was less than on a RYANAIR plane, so we asked to be moved and were given, not shown, other seats with a table in between.  The carriage was not full and these seats were empty, so why did they try to squash us into such small seats in the first place?\n\nUnfortunately, we found one of the four seats by the window was broken, which may explain why they didn't give us those seats in the first place but there was only two of us, so the broken seat didn't come into the equation?\n\nAnyway, our first impression of the train carriage was that it looked old, worn out, the paintwork was in a bad state, scratched and flaking, the carpet was old and heavily stained.  The seat cushions and general condition of the upholstery was poor, definitely NOT what we were expecting in Business Premier class.  When asking a staff member about accessing the Wifi, we were told, \"Oh! we don't have it on this train as it is a Vintage train\".  It wasn't vintage it was old and decrepit.\n\nStill we were looking forward to the Raymond Blanc designed meal, advertised in their ticket options for Business Premier.  First came a bread roll, small croissant and butter, with tea, or coffee, a yoghurt an a small bottle of OJ & water.  OK to start the journey with, the breakfast was welcome but nothing out of the ordinary.  Sometime later they collected our trays and brought out lunch, yippee!  We were offered either, a cold chicken dish with salad, or a hot dish.  We both chose the hot dish, wanting to see what culinary delight lay in store for us, designed by Raymond Blanc. Excited!\n\nWhat we were given was.... A very neat rectangle of scrambled egg, two weeny rashers of overcooked (tough, not crisp) bacon, three cherry tomatoes and some sliced mushrooms in a very tarte vinegar sauce.  That was it.\n\nHardly a meal worthy of claims to have been designed by Raymond Blanc.  A 5 year old could have \"designed\" it.  I commented that scrambled eggs and bacon was a dish that dates back centuries, way before Raymond Blanc ever thought of \"designing\" it.  Absolutely awful, a real let down.\n\nThe whole experience was hugely disappointing and at a whopping price of \u00a3288 per person, one way, it left a really bad taste in the mouth, much like the Raymond Blanc \"designed\" meal.\n\nWhen we got home, I decided to tell Eurostar about our poor experience, letting them know that it was well below our expectations of Business Premier class, including all of the comments detailed above.  I wasn't sure what to expect in response but what I got was wholly unacceptable, dismissive and cynical reply.  It appeared the responder had not read my letter thoroughly, or it was just a standard letter.\n\nI wrote back, saying I was unhappy with their reply and i received another letter simply repeating the first letter writer's excuses, ending by saying I trust you enjoyed your trip and look forward to you welcoming you on board Eurostar again in the future???  This was supposed to be from their Customer Services department, more like the Sales Preventatives department.\n\nAnother letter from me, resulted in this last reply.  \n\n\"The meals in Business Premier are designed by Ramond (sic) Blanc. I am sorry that the meal was not to your taste and this has been fed back  (Was that an unintended pun) to the catering team for you.\n\nWe currently have 4 of our original trains left in service, so we use our newer trains on our website as you are much more likely to travel on either a refurbished or new train. The remainder of the original trains should be removed from service by the end of the year. \n\nWi fi is not available on our original trains, we do mention this in our conditions of carriage that if wi fi is not available then we are regrettably not able to offer compensation for this. \n\nThe service we offer onboard, the business lounge access and also the flexibility that we offer within the cost of a Business Premier ticket all remain the same regardless of the type of train you travel on. \n\nI hope that this explains everything for you and I hope that we can welcome you back onboard in the future.\"\n\nNot bloody likely!!!  By the way, Wifi is in paragraph 56 of their terms & conditions, near the very end.  Has anyone read the terms & conditions before booking a ticket? I doubt it very much, we were only buying a blooming train ticket!\n\nThe only one thing I can say good about the journey is, it arrived on time. Nothing else good about it.\n\nDirectors of Eurostar, wake up and smell the coffee, no wait, taste the food, it's *hit.  You have lost another two passengers, not even a hint of a sincere apology, no acceptance of the points raised just lame excuses.  They couldn't wait to tell us that they would not be offering us any compensation, funny that, we didn't ask for any.  However, it would have been nice to perhaps offer a discount off a future journey but no, our comments about our experience were dismissed out of hand.\n\nEurostar, NEVER AGAIN and I really hope this very lengthy review of the disgusting way you treat your passengers is read by many before they think of paying for a Business Premier ticket, it is NOT worth it.",

A couple of days before we were due to leave, we were informed by text that on the return journey the train wouldn't stop at Ashford, but at Ebbsfleet and then we'd catch a SE train back to Ashford. However, when we arrived at Ashford for the outward journey, we were told that the Ebbsfleet diversion was necessary, too. Having boarded the train at Ebbsfleet, we continued back to Ashford, but apparently, someone was threatening to commit suicide by jumping onto the track. This resulted in a total delay of 70 minutes. Although this was not Eurostar's fault, we were given EUR 12.50 compensation for each ticket. However, this was not cash, but will be deducted from any future Eurostar tickets, IF WE EVER USE THEM AGAIN!! On both outward and return journeys, our reserved seats were changed (we were still on the same trains as booked, so there was no excuse for this). Why reserve seats if they are not honoured?  After this poor experience, I will think long and hard before taking a risk with them again.",

Way overcrowded, people everywhere.\n2) Train on way out delayed by 40 mins, not a believable reason given.\n3) My partner could not use her tickets out and back due to having an accident, no ability to cancel, only exchange, at ridiculous costs.\n4) Had to come back early, exchanged 3 of my 4 tickets (partners was not used/exchanged), cost of gbp 350, more than the tickets cost. Moved from 4pm Sunday to 10am Sunday.\n5) On way back from Paris, queues getting through security, tickets, passport control x2; so badly managed. We got straight through, however loads of people didn\u2019t and missed their train due to this.\n6) Train therefore delayed by 40 minutes approx.\n7) Most of the toilets were not working, or were in a state whereby you would rather not use them.\n8. This one made me laugh, held up before getting in to Ebbsfleet, why? Someone forgot to redirect the tracks into Ebbsfleet. Haha, one job!!\n\nSo, was happy to leave it at that, then find out they charged me the gbp350 exchange TWICE.\n\n9) Sent an email explaining this, and outlining some of the above points. They couldn\u2019t care less really. Told me I needed to contact the website or agent directly that I booked with. I changed my booking on Eurostar website, and was emailing Eurostar contact form, via their website. \n\n10) Explained this to them. Never heard back. Sent them another email asking for them to respond to me. Nothing, they don\u2019t care!\n\nSo, Eurostar suck. HSBC don\u2019t, they refunded me the money immediately and will take this up on my behalf.",

I found a hotel for the night & got an EasyJet flight back the next day.  Now my insurance company won't refund me for the expense without confirmation from Eurostar that the delay was more than 24hrs. Eurostar refuse to confirm this, saying they run plenty of trains, so I might have got home within 24hrs, notwithstanding what we were told in Paris.  But irrespective of what we were told in Paris & no matter how long I'd waited in Paris for a train, if I'd incurred any expenses for a hotel etc there would be no way of proving that I had got on the first train available & therefore would still not be able to claim anything on insurance.  Thanks to them I am now more than \u00a3300 out of pocket.  They don't even deserve one star, but there was no option to give less.",

        "review_text": "We arrived 3 minutes after the gates were closed, but still 27 minutes before the train departure. Then I approached one of the staff and she simply and without any flexibility refused to let us go through the gate. I argued with her for a couple of minutes until one of her colleague arrived and asked the problem. She told her that we were 5 minutes late and that's the reason she didn't let us go through( of course, by that time we were 5 minutes late because I was arguing with her for 2 minutes. If I have argued with her for 15 minutes then she surely would have claimed we were 18 minutes late). Noticing her attitude and approach I realized that she is one the most unhelpful person that regardless of 1 minute late or 3 or 5 minutes she wouldn't let us entry. (Based on her personal reaction and attitude I kind of felt that probably she would have let us go through If we were not from a small ethnic minority).\nSurely, we were 3 minutes late, but she could see that we were with pram and kids and she could have let us go through and nothing would have happened. She asked us to visit the ticket office to find out that we have to pay about \u00a3176 extra, wait for 2 hours and likely be allocated in different carriage(with baby and kids). I refused to accept as this was just a day visiting Paris for the kids to see the Eiffel tower and The Louvre and back to London in the evening. \nWhen leaving the station I approached her to let her know that she ruined our day. Then she told me that we were 6 minutes late. When I heard that I had nothing to say. Just shocked.Couldn't believe.\nAn absolutely dreadful and pathetic person.",

This is not to do with the trains, but with their offering and horrendous customer service.\nEurostar offers tickets for half the trip and all of the costs as connections may no longer be running when arriving at a transfer point. The first available connection, for me, was over 7 hours later (more than twice the total travel time). For the majority of people with a job this is going to be unacceptable.\nOne would expect that such tickets are simply unavailable or that this, at the very least, is very clear when ordering tickets. This is far from the truth however.\nYour options are: waiting 7 hours, getting a hotel or driving to and from the transfer point.\nCompensation for this inconvenience is unlikely as this requires you to contact customer service. Customer service is rarely excellent, but Eurostar is another story alltogether.\nCustomer service will tell you that they think it is perfectly normal to offer such an inferior product, to communicate this poorly and to leave their customers high and dry.\nEveryone not willing to wait for over 7 hours, is making a \"personal choice\" according to Eurostar and will have to bear the cost themselves. Another tactic of theirs is to advise you to take it up with your insurer. Eurostar refuses to accept any responsibility and prefers to play \"hot potatoe\" with their customers' problems.\nOther unbearable customer service responses:\n\"We are sorry that you feel this way. We can ask someone else within the organization, but this will not alter our decision.\"\n\"We understand this is not the answer you were hoping for. Here is a link of no help whatsoever: \u2026\"\nEventually they will stop answering you alltogether, because that is the best way to deal with clients that wish to be treated fairly: Pretend they don't exist",

        "review_text": "I would rate my experience as 0 stars but this is not an option!!!\n\nThe first issue was that the package was not delivered on time, and in fact arrived 4 days late. Through out this process i had to contact the Euro Despatch contact centre several times to find out where and what was happening to my package. Even though I left my number with them and multiple times they said they would contact me as to what would happen with my package, i received no call back. This service is unacceptable and should be looked into asap to sort it out. \n\nOn to the second issue, while in transit the bag has been opened and several items have been stolen including a laptop and digital camera. On top of this i have found a few items deliberately damaged, such as a pair of running shoes which have had the shoe laces cut. Who does that??? It makes me sick thinking what might have happened to the bag and contents while it was in transit.  I don't know how this could happen as they say they keep the bags in a secure area. \n\nAfter contacting Eurostar about the stolen goods they said they would reply within 14 days. 2 and a half months later and multiple emails and phone calls to try get an answer on my case they finally replied taking no responsibility for the stolen goods during transport and no refund of my service fee after the bag arrived 4 days late. I can not express how useless the Eurostar team are and how much they don't care about you or your personal items!!\n\nThe experience using Euro Despatch has been very disappointing, I hope someone else can see this review and avoid them in the future. Never transport oversized goods or bicycles with Eurostar!!!!",

No signs as to where to check in - but by asking a security officer we found it is located on a small balcony upstairs. This was packed - people were still checking in for the 06:45 train at 0645!\nthe first passport control had two people on it - one working and one watching him work. The second passport control (why two ???) was little better but at least here the e-passport machines were sometimes working. Then more queues for security and more queues to get onto the platform. The train left 45 mins late (and arrived in London 45 mins late) - all due to the inept check-in in Paris.\n\nIf I never travel by Eurostar again it will be too soon.",

Machines for biometric passport rebooting. Awful staff and absolutely no sense of responsibility from the company.

Further to my negative review 3 days ago Eurostar's response is below, very dissappointing, gone are the days when they'd offer a free ticket unconditionally. Good will out of the window. This cuts both ways. I shall now use them as a last resort and make others aware of their poor standards:\n\nDear Richard\n \nThank you for your email. I'm sorry that your Eurostar journey was disrupted.\n\nIn regards to your Taxi charges and refunding the charge you faced there, unfortunately this is classed as a consequential loss. To claim expenses for these costs, you'll need to get in touch with your travel insurance provider. If you need anything from us to support your claim, please let me know. We'll be happy to provide you with the information you might need about the disrupted journey.\n\nI can see you were delayed by (92) minutes. You are therefore entitled to either:\n\nAn e-voucher to the value of (\u00a314), which you can claim Here.\n\nA partial refund to the value of (\u00a314), which you can claim Here.\n\nThe way this is worked is based on our compensation policy. Any part of your journey that is delayed by 60-119 minutes, you are entitled to compensation valued at 25% of the price of the affected leg. \n\nTo find out more about compensation, take a look at our Help Centre.\n\nI hope this helps but if there's anything else I can do, please get in touch.\n\n\nKind regards,\nMohammed\n\nEurostar Customer Care",

The service ran with 70 min delay.\nNow, I do understand that signal failure is not the Eurostar\u2019s fault, but this did mean that I got to my destination at around midnight, and that over an hour late, I do believe you offer compensation?\nMy biggest problem was the return, my Eurostar ticket was from \u201cany beligian station\u201d, so I had to change to get the Eurostar from there. One of the trains from my previous station stopped on the track which meant that I couldn\u2019t meet the 30 minute in advance, after running, I only manage to get to the Eurostar desk 20 minute in advance, with my train still up on the board.\nThe staff at the brussels Eurostar desk really weren\u2019t very friendly at all and they didn\u2019t let me get through. Saying it was \u201c shut \u201c event though the train hadn\u2019t yet departed.\nI say that I could run, as it was the last one of the night, really needing to get home I really wanted to get on it. But they snapped at me saying I can\u2019t expect the train nor the boarder police to \u201cjust wait for me \u201c.\nThey said I was too late and didn\u2019t show any compassion.\nI only had a small hand bag, my passport at the ready, I could have ran . \nit makes me so upset that this means I had to get a hotel overnight or get a night bus .\nI only ask that Eurostar could have shown a little bit of compassion. I am so disappointed with a service that I always have seen as luxury that has let me down twice over the weekend.\nHaving spent 110 pounds on my ticket I am really upset and especially feel that it was fair. \nI really love Eurostar and I am sad that my opinion is now tainted, now please tell me, is it normal for Eurostar to act this way? Or is this just unfortunate on my side?\nThank you \nMarilia",

        "review_text": "We were due to go to Disneyland Paris via Lille on Monday 14th May. At the time of booking we did not know about the train strikes in France. The day before we where due to leave I got a email from the French train network. Most of it was in French, understandably, so I didn't understand it but I managed to work out that it said that our connecting train in Lille had been cancelled. I phoned Eurostar, who had made no attempt to tell me this, who said it had not been cancelled. I checked the French train network website which reported that it had been cancelled. I phoned back again and this time they admitted they had made a mistake and the connection had been cancelled. If I had not checked myself then I could have been stranded in Lille with my 2 year old son on the word of a Eurostar customer services call handler. Appalled! Will never use Eurostar again!\nUPDATE:\nI contacted Eurostar who initially told me I had not booked through them in the first place which made me both angry and bemused. How on earth do they not know if I'd booked with them or not! When I eventually convinced them that I had booked with them they stated it wasn't there problem as it was the French Network who's train it was. All this despite the fact I'd booked through them. They said the call centre employee didn't have the information at the time but did have it five minutes later when I phoned back. I feel lied too! I emplore you please don't use Eurostar! I will never travel with them again.",

        "review_text": "Normally Eurostar is OK, I use them about 10 times per year and things generally work (even at the notorious Paris terminal).  But they have really struggled with managing the impact of the SNCF strikes in April.  I have had three sets of reservations cancelled because of this, but couldn't change them on line (other than for extortionate prices, even though the advice page claimed I could change them for free) nor get through to their call centre to change them at all over many attempts.  This meant I could not be sure of travelling on any particular train back from Dresden via Brussels to London so I went by plane instead.  You should be aware that, if you do make a booking with Eurostar, the most they will give you back in such a situation is the fare paid with no compensation.  When I did get through to the call centre (about 10 days after I got back), there was no question of a compensation ticket for another time because their 'policy when things go wrong' has been watered down.  Because I had booked sometime in advance, the fare paid was nowhere what it actually cost to get back that day (8th April).  It was a poor experience all round, even BA managed better last May during their power outage.  My advice:  don't make ANY bookings with them whilst the strikes continue, you will be left on your own if the train is cancelled!!!",

Closer to the date we asked if we could delay the trip due to a unexpected health surgery my partner had to have which meant he was not fit to travel. We did not want a refund just to move it a week or two later or atleast a gift voucher to use for another booking with the same company. They were not willing to understand or cooperate. Kept referring us to the travel insurance company which made no sense at all for us to do as the excess alone was the same cost. The hotel (hotels.com) gave us a refund understanding our situation because they hve empathy and care but eurostar are just business money orientated!\nHundreds of times they have empty seats going back and forth so what difference does it make with 2 changes for this unexpected and sad circumstance(medical evidence could have been provided from the doctor) They instead told us we can pay the same price as our return trip per journey to chance it. Quite hillarious.\nI will never travel with eurostar again if i can help it and because of this response we decided to not go to paris/france but chose another europe destination. \nShame on eurostar!",

Any response from customer services was scripted and consisted of policy paragraphs being copied and pasted into emails. Not helpful whatsoever and left me feeling angry and lost.\n\nNo reply from my attempt to communicate with the CEO either. No surprises there I suppose. \n\nI have for many years defended their high prices to friends and family saying the service was fantastic and made life so much easier when travelling to France. However, as a direct result of my last experience, I shall never use Eurostar again and will certainly not be advocating them to friends and family ever again.\n\nShame on you, Eurostar.",

Had it not been for my husband speaking fluent French we wouldn't have had anyone to help us. Eventually we were taken aside and it took so long to find a form we nearly missed the train.The staff were so rude as if we were about to be charged for something. Not necessary at all ! The form I was given had the wrong email address for contact and I have spent all morning trying to find the correct email. To add insult to injury we were given incorrect info regarding the strike and we had to rebook our seats to get a seat four hours later.We spent \u00a340 on a taxi to Lille Station to get accurate info  as on line details were contradictory. Not impressed at all .In Lille's favour the staff were far more obliging ! Our on going connections from Euston were totally messed up and the day ended splendidly 12 hours later with trains still out of action on the route to Blackpool. Cest.la vie....plus ca change !",

As well as the terrible journey Euro star failed to respond in a satisfactory manor after the events not responding for two weeks after my initial complaint and then once I finally received a reply it was a very unconvincing acknowledgment of the events and that they will look into them.

The staff at Paris were extremely busy due to this being in the middle of the union strikes in Paris but were pleasant and helpful in every respect. The train itself was clean, comfortable and again the staff on board pleasant and engaging. The negatives: Paris Gare du Nord is not set up properly for Eurostar. The queuing system is a shambles but I'm sure this is due to lack of space. One or two more staff would ease the problems of group bookings just pushing through lines that have been halted due to congestion and more money needs to be invested into the customs process.(this is no fault of Eurostar ). If you are travelling standard or premium standard be prepared to queue and re queue and allow yourself plenty of time. Even with these negatives we found it a totally enjoyable experience.",

The said insurance was supposed to cover the cancellation fees but it was not advertised that economy tickets were not refundable. Thanks to Eurostar I wasted 300 pounds. So I urge anyone wanting to travel with this company (I would advise you not to but should you anyway) to check about a good hundred times where you are going and when and not to waste more of your money on a useless insurance.",

        "review_text": "Hello\n\nOn March 22nd, in a context of SNCF strike and multiple Eurostar cancellations, I made a booking change by mistake which is heavily charged by the Eurostar services:\n\nMy train was scheduled for March 23rd London-Paris from 07:01 (booking RTMASC). Late evening on March 22, I went on the site eurostar.com to go through train cancellations news, I unfortunately confused the cancellation of the 07:04 Paris - Londres for my 07: 01 train.\nEurostar was offering to make a booking change for the canceled trains, without further wait I changed my booking- which I thought was canceled. It must be known that this trip was only a stop from my ultimate destination, going to the Caribbean for long awaited reunion with my family.\nIn this context of initial error on my part, I was convinced that the train was canceled and that I would be moreover reimbursed 100% by Eurostar because of the strike as it was announced.\n\n- Booking change made on March 23rd at 00:34 for the London-Paris train from 05:40 \u00a3 260 fees\n\nI received confirmation with note that the train was overbooked and did not have a guaranteed seat.\n\nPlease note that only 15 minutes had passed, late at night, between the change and the \u2018cancellation of the change '.\nThis was not done for comfort or a change of mind, a large part of the trains were canceled and I thought I did what I was asked by changing the booking of a canceled train with a refund that would follow subsequently by Eurostar services. I must add that until 5am, my train did not appear on 'live departure' from where my confusion even greater\n\nA beautiful mistake! Certainly, but what I find more worrying is again the lack of service of Eurostar. They have refused to date to cancel these fees. We are talking about \u00a3 322, a nice sum.\n\nI appeal to your understanding and help on this case.\n\nWaiting for an answer.\n\nM.",

So I tried and tried numerous times (and I really mean numerous) to book and pay for a ticket on the Saturday evening with no success as it always came up with an error message. So tried and tried again the following morning again with no success, so eventually had to give in and had to phone up to place my order for my tickets.......\"yes sir we've been having problems with our website, but that'll still cost you \u00a310 for booking over the phone!!!!!!\"\nWhen I complained to customer services they said I should of kept a note of the error code, does it state that anywhere that I had to do that.I even gave the customer services guy the time of my telephone call to book the tickets so he could actually hear their employee say that they were having problems. What if the website was having problems for a week, what are you meant to do then?????SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY A BOOKING FEE IF THE WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY!!!!!!!!! Been trying to explain this to a customer services man who surprise surprise doesn't agree.....eventually with all these 1 star reviews I hope they receive a huge fine somewhere along the line!!!!!\nPlus I lost out on the 15% interrail offer.

We were left stranded outside of Brussels - for nearly 3 hours, despite the fact we were only 10km away from the station. There was no information, no explanation and no standard of care. The poor ground staff were given no advice and guidance from their company and the train was full of distressed children and elderly people - including a disabled person who was reportedly having difficulties as the air was getting more and more muggy. Conflicting information was eventually fed back to us - including complete lies from the Eurostar twitter team. No compensation has been offered - no apology was made. When I eventually looked through the website myself the computer informed me I would be entitled to \u00a314.50.......it is insulting. We lost hours of our holiday, missed connecting trains on the way back with another delay. Then were told that we could have an E-Voucher?! No thank you - I have no desire to travel on your service again. We were dumped on the old trains each time - there was no protocol with how to deal with the distressed passengers. No meal or sustenance was provided. Only one poor guard dealing with the train as all other Eurostar attendants hid from the clearly confusing situation. Then to have a condescending and unhelpful customer service politely tell me all the ways they will rip me off as a consumer. My train on route home was also delayed meaning that we would miss another connection - it was just over an hour late - but Eurostar are trying to argue it was 55 minutes late. Yet again - shoddy customer service and communication.",

I had a \"chicken caesar\" wrap on the way back from Paris which was really soggy, no flavour, just chicken, lettuce and soggy wrap. And it said \"use by\" the following day - to think what it would have been like after another day!\nFor me, check in and boarding has been fine. But the ticket purchase was also difficult, with problems with the website. \nEurostar - you really need to get some new management.\nUpdate a few years later.

This is the second Friday in 2 weeks where I will be 30 minutes delayed (but no compensation, while it represents a 25% time increase of the journey). My husband travelling last WE had no more luck.\nI don't understand why on earth they have the Paris and Brussels trains leaving at the same time. Why not 18:15?? That would reduce congestion at passport control. And there seems to be much less trains on Friday evening too which is stupid. \nFor those who complained about wifi never working, it is very simple. It does not work if you travel standard. Every time I happen to be in S. Premier, it works. Could Eurostar just stop advertising a service they only provide to some customers?\nFinally, on the points robbery for the loyalty program, I also fully agree with Jeffrey Tribe. I am a platinum member or equivalent on a few airlines, and I have never seen my points erased. AF is revamping their loyalty program and I am still Platinum - thank you very much. Much to think about Mr Felonious Gru. \nGiven the price you have to pay for such poor service, I may also like many others fly instead of taking the train. Or not go as often back to Paris.

The departure area at st pancras was complete chaos and they stopped letting people through to prevent over crowding.\n\nThe return leg from Paris was equally painful. The queue was so big it was snaking all over the ground floor of the station and took over 1 hour to get through. The facilities at Gard du Nord are not setup to handle large amounts of people and made the whole experience stressful. The train had to leave 20 minutes late as most passengers hadn't made it through security in time.\n\nFurthermore, the train arrived into London 1 hour late due to track problems approaching the channel tunnel.\n\nI must stress this is completely unacceptable for a major piece of transport infrastructure to operate in this way and desperately needs addressing by Eurostar senior managers.\n\nIn future I will be flying to Paris from London city airport; less stress, cheaper fares and more reliable service.",

However Eurostar will not re-calculate status points from previous trips using the new system, it will just consider the status points earned under the previous scheme. This is unfair because status points under the previous scheme were harder to accrue but the point threshold to reach Carte Blanche status was much lower.     \n\n*******************\nI have been so frustrated by my dealings with Eurostar over the past month that I have created an account on trustpilot to share my experience. I am also hoping that enough people complain to force Eurostar to change its mind on the reset of all Carte Blanche status points following the introduction of its new \"loyalty\" scheme (Club Eurostar - a very e(xc)lusive club indeed). \n\nThe trustpilot review posted by stephenbriars on Club Eurostar / Carte Blanche is spot on. I also find that Jeffrey Tribe's comment that the new loyalty scheme must have been designed by Felonious Gru hits the nail on the head - you have to wonder who at Eurostar decided it was a good idea to alienate some of Eurostar's most loyal customers by simply erasing all of the points earned towards Carte Blanche status before the introduction of Club Eurostar. Why not just convert the points previously accumulated into the new system?\n\nA call and several emails to the customer care department highlighting the obvious flaws of the current scheme have yielded absolutely nothing except for references to the Club Eurostar terms and conditions. However upon review of said terms and conditions (at least the version available on 10 February 2018) I could find absolutely no reference to Carte Blanche status points being reset following the introduction of Club Eurostar - maybe the people who drafted these terms and conditions were trying to thwart Felonious Gru's evil plan? The unhelpful Eurostar representative I was in touch with could not direct me either to the relevant clause.\n\nI have seen Eurostar's response to stephenbriar and Jeffrey Tribe that their case was being investigated but I am not holding much hope that this is anything but an attempt by Eurostar to appear reasonable on trustpilot. I will certainly update my review if Eurostar finally comes to its senses. In the meantime - Eurostar you earn one star from me...",

As Carte Blanche member I have tried to get in touch with the dedicated telephone number for the last two days without success. No success with general customer service number either. I am growing increasingly frustrated and found myself to spend more on BA lately than on Eurostar. I forgot to mention that the the web chat had been equally unavailable any time I tried to connect to it. Please get your act together!",

        "review_text": "I travelled with eurostar on 26th December. I called before regarding special assistance as my son is autistic and large crowds/queues etc cause high anxiety and stress and causes him to vomit amongst other things. I was told to arrive 90minutes early and go to the assistance desk and we would be helped. I did this and also took proof of my sons issues with me. The man took one look at my husband and I our 3 suitcases, our 7 year old son, our 2 year old daughter an practically laughed. He said you have him with you to help with children and bags why are you here?\nWe joined the security queue where it was extremely busy and my son vomited into a carrier bag as his anxiety went through the roof. Once through security it wasn't clear where we had to queue. We asked another female operative who mumbles instructions. We politely asked for her to repeat and she raised her voice at us complaining she had already told us where to go once. We also had a small delay and another long queue up stairs to board. All not a problem if you aren't travelling with somebody who's disability controls their feelings. Our son spent the whole journey backwards and forwards to the toilet as he had found everything al so stressful. Not what I wanted for the start of our holiday to Disneyland!",

        "review_text": "Eurostar reviewed its frequent traveller scheme in September 2017. It first communicated changes via emails to its customer database in vague and positive terms promoting transfer of its \u2018reward\u2019 points on a 1:1 basis. It neglected to inform that it\u2019s tier/status points - to provide benefits for travel - would be reset to zero for all members at launch in December 2017.  For customers who accrued points during 2017 it knowingly issued worthless points during the year without any transparency. In communication with its Customer \u2018Care\u2019 team their autopilot response deems this abuse of monopoly both \u2018fair\u2019 and \u2018a level playing field\u2019 for its customers. Without consideration it penalises and disappoints travellers who have desired to access premium level benefits for frequent or premium level tickets. It\u2019s cursory, ill conceived and ill communicated \u2018marketing\u2019 campaign has angered many travellers by erasing their travel history, loyalty, and shows through it's website what appears to be a deliberate intent to remove previous tier status questions from its FAQ sections. Delve into the small print and the Club Eurostar 'terms and conditions' prominently state transition conditions for its reward points, yet omits to inform that status points will be reset to nil. In direct communication it takes a dismissive and unqualified \u2018this matter is closed\u2019 stance to queries to avoid resolution. Their approach to customer service suggests a significant backlog of complaints measured only by achieving a \u2018cases closed\u2019 metric of success. Further research shows it\u2019s CEO, Nicolas Petrovic, was previously Director of Customer Services which worryingly indicates a detached and dismissive approval of a revised loyalty scheme that alienates it\u2019s most precious and valuable core customers. Eurostar deserves it\u2019s one star status (trust pilot does not offer zero star reviews) for its arrogant approach to customer \u2018care\u2019. Lets be clear that Eurostar disappoints in many key customer performance areas, and this subject is just one of many failures highlighting the brand's continued decline. A worthless and disappointing enterprise abusing its monopoly.",

So they show you one pricing grid and try to scam you when you're ready to book by saying that the tickets sold out (when they clearly didn't). \n\nFinally I called the Customer Service and after a while of convincing they said they can book me over the phone for the price quoted.

Check-in at Brussels Midi was as expected, go through 2 passport controls - one for leaving Belgium and the other for entering the UK. I was in Standard Premier.  X-ray is always a pain though as you have to lift your luggage up onto the belt.  Was served snack / breakfast on board with a croissant, roll, marmalade and butter, juice and coffee or tea.  Also a good selection of newspapers and magazines.\n\nChecking in at London Pancras was not so smooth though.  Perhaps due to being so close to the holidays?  Got there a good hour before departure hoping to browse the shops first, but ended up going in the already really, really long queue. \n\nWas an overall pleasant journey and great to depart from Brussels center and arrive inside London.

        "review_text": "Despite the shiny outward image this company attempts to create, there underlies an organisation that is mean, incompetent and totally un-customer foccussed. Since inception of the service some 20 years ago there has been a significant decline in customer service. \n\nLOYALTY SCHEME\nThe review they have made of their Loyalty programme is shocking - the architect must have been Felonious Gru from 'Despicable Me'. No warning of change, points have been lost overnight and a ridiculous new system introduced where to earn points the booking must be linked to individually named passengers own loyalty schemes. So if booking for your family, you will need multiple Loyalty schemes in place! Add to this the fact that you now have to have 500 points minimum to exchange points for a single ticket and your points are only valid for 12 or 24 moths before they get re-set to zero. Absolutely crazy. A huge marketing and PR blunder. Would be better to simply end the scheme alltogether. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE\nReturning from Paris on 2 January my family were treated with rudeness and disdain by a member of their staff controlling the entry point to the check-in. Not good. Not a respectful greeting more a telling off for not automatically going in a direction they required - made to feel like a refugee.\n\nBOOKING THROUGH TICKETS TO THE EUROSTAR TERMINAL\nDespite what their website suggests, it's simply not possible to purchase through tickets from Bedford to St. Pancras and then on to other destinations such as Paris - the website won't allow it and Eurostar staff can't make it work either! As consequence, you end up spending a fortune on extra British Rail tickets for the missing leg of the journey! So sad that the facility they used to have in place with a fantastic chap in Cambridge called Bob has gone. You used to be able to buy BR tickets through Bob at excellent rates. Bob was made redundant and he told everyone it was now automated on line but it doesn't work.\n\nON- BOARD WIFI\n\"Sorry sir it doesn't appear to be working\"\n\nTELEPHONING EUROSTAR\nRecorded music, Recorded music, Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,  - hang-up - Impossible to get through.\n\nOBTAINING A REFUND FOR CANCELLED TRAINS\nVirtually impossible and highly complex because their systems cannot send refund info emails to people with btinternet accounts!\n\nOur feelings for this company are rock bottom - we need another operator in place.\n\nHope somebody from Eurostar is listening and will respond!",

After a lengthy conversation wanting to speak to management he told me Phil, Josh or Shoaib would call me on Thursday, where of course I didn't receive a call.\n\nToday I had to chase up again today where eventually I spoke to Shoaib where we went round in round in circles with the amount to change the tickets would be \u00a3131.\n\nI explained the simplicity of the situation and the experience I have had with Eurostar staff over the past week... at the least Eurostar should be amending my Booking as a matter of urgency.\n\nI have wasted nearly 3 hours of my week speaking and getting scripted information throughout.\n\nThis is my first time using Eurostar and it has been a horrific service throughout.\n\nI am still waiting for a response after two emails and need the situation resolved as I am supposed to be travelling next week!",

        "review_text": "I have used Eurostar regularly in the past but have not travelled on it for a couple of years. Changes have been made to the check-in process but this is not in any way clear from the email confirmation, and consequently I was not allowed on the train. \n\nI arrived at St Pancras about half an hour before departure (as I had previously always done). I was told that check-in now closed 30 minutes before departure and because I was 5 minutes late, they would not allow me through. I explained that it was not clear from the email confirmation that there was now a hard cut-off at 30 minutes but they still would not let me through, even though the train wouldn\u2019t leave for 25 minutes. I later saw a different staff member allowing someone through who had a train leaving in 15 minutes. \n\nThe customer service is arbitrary, the passport control infrastructure is inadequate (which causes delays) and there is no attempt to help passengers make the correct train. It is also not clear from confirmation emails that there is intended to be an airport-style cut off for check-in at 30 minutes before departure - although clearly this is dependent on the whim of individual employees.\n\nI have previously had a positive experience of Eurostar and I am disappointed by the changes I experienced today.\n\nResponse to Eurostar\u2019s reply:\n\nThank you for your response. I do not think that your assumption is correct that the people who were allowed to check in 15 minutes before departure were Premier passengers. They were joining the main queue and I believe that Premier passengers have a separate check-in queue. The staff member in question told the passengers in question that they could try to make the train but that she couldn\u2019t guarantee that they would make it. We were not given this opportunity. \n\nI maintain that the wording in the confirmation email is not sufficiently clear, particularly for people who are used to the old system. It should state that (i) unless you have crossed the ticket barriers at least 30 minutes before the departure time, you will not be allowed to board the train and (ii) the queues for check-in can be very long and no priority will be given to passengers who have earlier trains.",

        "review_text": "I have just had the pleasure of meeting the rudest member of staff at Londons Kings Cross/St Pancreas Premier check in. After panicking all the way here after having trains cancelled or delayed we made it with 40 mins to spare so thought we should just about make it. Until we met their horrendous member of staff. She complained to us that we were late and that we might not get in. So I was panicking and said 'ok lets try the gate' she replied by saying that if I was going to be like that I had to go to the ticket office and then would not give my tickets back when I asked her. I then tried to take them back and she snatched them away and told me not to snatch... my own tickets. She then started swearing in french. I eventually had to speak to a less irrational member of staff which seemed to change the womans mind and she gave our tickets back. The whole time she complained that she had been working since 4am and that people were late and rude to her. She obviously shouldn't be working in a customer based job. Horrendous customer service and would rather swim the channel than use Eurostar again.",

We arrived to find we were already allocated to the next train with 5 mins to go before departure. No apology was offered and no real effort was made to get everyone on their allocated train even when we arrived on time. Sadly, Eurostar Paris were unable to fulfil the basic requirement of their service. Organising people to board the train.",

Naturally I tried to claim a partial refund but the website refused so I contact Eurostar but did not receive a reply for over 6 weeks (from my query on 4 September to their response on 19 October). I believe they are obliged to reply within four weeks so it appears they are trying to delay the response so I am almost outside of their 60 day refund deadline.\nTheir response was the train was only delayed by 37 minutes so I have asked them to justify the time as this is a completely dishonest lie.  Our train was due at 12.02 but arrived at 13.10 so I cannot honestly see how they can claim the train was only delayed by 37 minutes!

        "review_text": "My friend and I were looking for a daytime fare from London to Paris on Nov 7, 2017 and there were no fares for $61, which was the cheapest fare, available. We ended up reserving for a train that would put us in Paris almost at midnight for that price. The ticket was bought last week, and all of a sudden, last night, it appeared that there was a daytime train for the price, after all. We went ahead and changed the time and date for a train that put us in Paris around 11:30am, but we had to pay $48 penalty per person to switch it. Really Eurostar? What kind of predatory tactic is this? I see that the penalty information is visible right before you make the change, but at the end of the day, it is inconceivable to feel OK about paying pretty much for two extra tickets, when all we wanted was to get to Paris at a decent time; and to top it off, you state that if the price is higher at the time of the change, you have to pay the penalty PLUS the difference in fare, BUT if the new fare is lower, then NO  refund would be issued. I mean, regardless of your business reason for doing so, it really hurts to be out almost $100 to exchange a ticket for a different time on the same day for the same price. This is shameful! Shameful!",

Granted, I decided to travel Standard Premier from London to Brussels and a week later from Paris back to London. Both were very good but the last journey on 14 October was outstanding. The comfort, food and the staff were very impressive and I hope that they have finally started to get their act together. The terminal in Paris has improved but still does not compare with St Pancras. I just question why they do not give passengers more time to board at the ST Pancras end. Overall, I have to give them credit for the improvement and hope that the trend will continue.",

The customer service rep said this is not the first time he\u2019d seen this (then why isn\u2019t it fixed) suggested it could be auto fill (then why were there variations in the single name?) and why did I see three distinct names in the entry boxes?

Spoke to someone over email who told me I needed to get hold of customer service and gave me 2 numbers to call. both numbers had me on hold for over and hour so eventually gave up and tried to call another day etc etc.\n\nA few weeks later I emailed back to say that I'm having no joy with the phone lines and asked if this change could be done over email or if my sister would still be able to travel with the name incorrect on the ticket, I received a pretty blunt response \"the name must match the ticket, this cannot be done over email\"\n\nI thought it couldn't get any worse, I was wrong. I finally get through to a customer service consultant today who cannot help me in the slightest, hints its my fault for waiting so long to change the ticket and if I'd called sooner it would have been possible! like I haven't tried!! no choice but to buy another ticket which is unnecessary!\n\nI cannot even explain how furious I am, customer service bringing me to tears and ruining this whole trip for me, my mum and sister. unfortunately I'm unsure if my sister will be able to travel now as we cannot afford another ticket.\n\nannoyingly the line was cut off before I could speak to a manager so I'm on hold once again to try get this resolved.",

At that point I stated a number of us were waiting to board the Brussels train which was due to leave in less than 10 minutes.\nMiraculously  a wheelchair arrived and myself and the German couple were rushed through baggage checks etc.The handlers were not prepared to give any assistance with luggage and again the business class staff member and the German lady came to my assistance.\nOn reaching the lift there was no room for me and I was ordered (I do mean ordered)to follow another member of staff onto an escalator.No help at all was given with luggage until I complained.We then had to rush down the platform. Neither experience helped my bad back and I was back on painkillers.\nIthe would have been an easier experience to go through check in in the normal way,at least we would have had access to toilets and coffee and possibly seating.\nA bad start to a holiday.",

        "review_text": "The online booking site brought back no results for London to Avignon 3 times.  Phone lines very busy so booked online via Gare Du Nord, The from Gare Du Lyon to Avignon and returns.  \n\nEurostar does not provide sufficient seating for even half of the passengers at any station on these routes so even if you have mobility problems like 2 of my party have, tough luck!\n\nThe trip out was not too bad but on arrival at Gare Du Nord the only available ticket machine we found with English was faulty causing long queues.  The RER is to be avoided where possible, huge stations, insuffient signage and no service.  It took so long to obtain tickets we only just made our connection.\n\nThe return trip started off badly with one person being ill, which delayed our departure just long enough for us to see our train leave just as we entered the station.\n\nWe informed the ticket clerk that we needed replacement tickets to St Pancras and she could have booked us on a direct train but chose instead to put us on the same route back.  The original price for 3 people return was \u20ac899, the replacement ticket for the return was charged at \u20ac890 - one way!  She allowed 1.5 hours time to transfer through the RER but no sooner had we booked the ticket than they announced a 25 min delay!\n\nBoth of the next trains were delayed and we were told our train was next so we waited on the platform and boarded the next train.  There was some confusion as our seats were apparently double booked and there was no one around who spoke much English.  Some passengers tried to help and told us we were on the right train but when we left the station it was realised that we weren't.  Too late to do anything about it then we ended up sharing 2 seats between 3 of us.\n\nThere were no rail staff on the platform we could have asked either.\n\nThe RER was another nightmare, long queues for tickets.  \n\nOn arriving at Gare Du Nord, massive concourse over several levels, no signs for Eurostar.  Finally found our way with 15 minutes before departure.  Long queues at passport control for the later train but we managed to find a rail employee, explain about the delay from Avignon and he was going to take us through but they closed boarding before he could.  Back to ticket office to change for next available train, one seat in ticket office, 20 minute queue.  At least we didn't have to pay for new tickets!\n\nStaff were reasonably helpful when you could find them, at least in Gare Du Nord.  Avignon staff were not rude, but not as well trained as expected, initially quoted \u20ac130 for replacement tickets, no explanation as to why the were \u20ac890.  \n\nFor the prices charged you would expect a far superior service but what you get falls far short.  We chose Eurostar because we thought it would be an enjoyable cross country trip but it turned out to be extremely stressful and ruined the entire weekend.\n\nI am bilingual but don't speak French - I will not use French public transport again unless I have no option or manage to learn enough French beforehand.",

Only here to tell you that they cannot do anything about your complaint as you have to do it online.\n- once complaint is done online, they apparently can take 22 up to 28 WORKING days to reply now due to \"high volumes of emails\" (complaints?...)\nMy recent experience (reference  #03324701): I had to pay a \u00a330 fees to change my tickets although I arrived at least 15 min before departure, nobody was queuing and the train turned out to be half an hour delayed so I actually got to pay \u00a330 fee to take the exact same train.

        "review_text": "Very enjoyable journey from London - Paris. The check-in was smooth, the waiting time short, the train modern and very comfortable. The return journey was the complete opposite for a number of reasons. First, the waiting area at Gare Du Nord was overcrowded, uncomfortable and all-round poorly designed. Second, 10 minutes before boarding time we received an announcement that we had to evacuate the waiting area designated for London-bound passengers. What followed was nothing short of chaotic and distressing (particularly in the current political climate) - little direction from the staff present led to hordes of confused and anxious travellers going in all directions, knowing that they have to evacuate but not knowing how and where to.  \nAs the crowd gathered round the couple of unlucky members of staff on duty we were left there waiting with no further information on the evacuation. 10 mins later we were able to board the train. We'll never know what the evacuation was about. We're now leaving 25 minutes late on one of the older \"Vintage\" model trains that comes sans wifi. All in all the train looks like it should have been retired many moons ago. It has a very tired interior (and I'm in Standard Premier) - the pocket holder staring me in the face hangs limply from one side, having been detached/torn on one side, no doubt by a frustrated customer. It's actually kind of funny as it serves as a kind of visual metaphor for the return leg experience served up by Eurostar. It's a real shame as we've otherwise had a fantastic weekend in Paris! **Update - just been served a nice dinner, unfortunately it came with a filthy  wine glass. Sometimes you have to laugh- what else is there to do.",

        "review_text": "Shame Eurostar seems to have a bad rep, but nothing can be better than the experience of booking over the phone. This gentleman was fantastic. I was booking a trip to Lyon and he knew the city so well, giving me tips while completing the booking. What a great experience. Also was able to warn me of engineering works that were happening which allowed me to change my mind on dates (online didn't mention this). Additionally how the passport control works on the way back (apparently need to get off the train somewhere on the way and get the passport checked and get back on board). Wish I got his name - legend. \n\nValue for money wise, if you want a better experience I suggest travelling Premier Economy. I only travel in this class and have always received ok service (some onboard staff need to be friendlier I think). It's often not much more expensive than standard economy so check it out.",

Obviously, a better standard of customer service is reserved for celebrities travelling in in Premier Class.\nThis isn't the first time that I haven't received courtesy from this company.\nAs I live in Ashford, and visit relatives in Paris - Eurostar has always been an attractive option...but... I am really beginning to hate this company. In future, I'll take the ferry and put up with the drive.\nHonestly, to all those considering travelling standard class on Eurostar, think well before sacrificing your self-respect for a few hours off journey time.",

        "title": "Traumatised",
        "review_text": "Traumatised\n\nI arrived at the Gare du Nord station on Sunday at approximately 1730 to board my train back to St Pancras where there are no clear signs regarding details of Eurostar check in and no help points. Having read online that the standard waiting time is 30 min I ensured to arrive on time for check in. To my shock and horror, I arrived to a chaotic scene with endless queues and panicked people with heavy bags and suitcases. The queue consisted of travellers for three different trains, one for 18 13 departure, one for 18 43 and one for around 19.13 with nowhere to sit. Their systems had clearly failed and we had to queue really far. I asked a lady holding up a sign whether I was missing my 18.13 am train at least 3 times and she told me I was on the right queue and to get back in the queue. As time passed, I panicked more and more. Eventually reaching the check in, I ran up another lady and showed her my tickets. She informed me that I was few min late and that the check in was closed. She advised me that I should buy a new ticket from SNCF. They were not taking responsibility for their chaotic system but wanted me to pay for a new ticket and had clearly rehearsed a speech. I was pleading with her that I am extremely busy and must be back in London asap. I also pleaded with her as my mother was clearly unwell and was not fit to wait any further having queued up forever. There were nowhere to sit and my mother simply collapsed on their floor in despair. The lady would not even listen to me and just held her hand up and told me to book new tickets. She marked my tickets \"17 53\" and asked me to go to the ticket office. I find it puzzling that she marked my ticket with the time at that time rather taking into account the fact that I had already been waiting patiently in the queue.\n\nI looked for the person who told me to purchase new tickets, however she was extremely rude and claimed she had no clue when their own ticket office would be opening or whether there would be any seats left for the 18 43 train. I then managed to find the ticket office and stood in the queue in a state of panic to purchase new tickets. Despite the chaos, only one person was working in the ticket office. I managed to obtain new tickets and was told that I must pay 80 euros. No explanation as to why this sum or why I have to pay. I received my new tickets at 18 10 as marked on the receipt. Whilst waiting in the queue, I spoke to three others who were also forced to purchase new tickets despite arriving well in advance. I find this a ploy to make money in a situation where clearly the management is non-existent.  Despite my new tickets, I just about made the new train for 18 43. The queue and the security check in was beyond catastrophic and I was distressed for the entire duration. This only demonstrates the mismanagement of Eurostar. Having read some of the reviews online subsequent to my experience, I note that this is a common phenomenon with Eurostar. I have been traumatised and left sick after my return from Paris.  I find this to be completely unacceptable, irrational and unfair. Rather than offering me a clear and calm explanation, the staff was extremely rude, blunt and unsympathetic. They raised their voice, gave me orders, spoke to me in an evidently angry tone and refused to offer any form of apology or assurance despite seeing that I was distressed. Moreover, I am convinced that Eurostar is making money by targeting vulnerable people in an attempt to generate more money. This should be brought to the attention of the press and media. People should be deterred from using Eurostar.",

        "review_text": "Purchased an interrail global pass for the both of us, having realised you can now use interrail on Eurostar, so I decided to look into booking some reduced price tickets, only to realise you need to call the customer service line and book with an agent, which i thought was a bit 1994. They don't pick up the phone after being on hold for several hours over a 3 day period. I decided to book tickets at the full price as i could'nt get to an agent to book me on with interrail discount. I eventually got hold of someone who I thought was rather cold and abrupt when i asked her to refund me my tickets and rebook me with my interrail pass discount, she would'nt help me out whatsoever, even though i had said i could'nt get hold of anyone as i was on hold for hours over 3 days.  Shocking customer service, but i suppose when a company has the monopoly of running international rail services, customer service does'nt come into it. In my experience, when everything works on Eurostar, its a pleasure. But when it goes wrong, the old chesnut of bad customer service rears its head. I remember a few years ago, we slowed down at Dollands Moor and stopped just outside the channel tunnel for 75 minutes, with no explanation given for the delay. We are not idiots, tell us there is a failed train infront of us or a points failure.",

        "review_text": "Me and my partner paid \u00a3300 each for tickets from Nice to St Pancreas. Train from Nice to Paris Gare De Lyon was delightful. Then we had to catch a train from Gare De Lyon to Paris Nord station, which was not clearly notified at all on the Eurostar website when we booked the tickets. We realised this on the train to Gare De Lyon so we realised we had to change station. This was a nightmare, no one spoke English and all the signage was in French. After finally getting to Paris Nord and into the Eurostar queue we were told we were 3 minutes late to check in. Went to the ticket office who tried charging \u00a340 each to be put on the next train which was  1 hour later. Explained to the staff that there was no way that we could have got from one station to the other due to our circumstances and language barriers any faster and having paid for premium tickets we thought that been 3 minutes late was very mean, especially with the price we paid. They refused to listen to anything we had to say, and tried to make it our own wrong doing. Once we were on the train all was well though, on time and friendly staff. A very stressful experience with poor customer service, could so easily have been a pleasant journey.",

        "review_text": "I had a really bad experience with Eurostar. I went onto the website to change my outward journey from London - Paris. After I made all the changes selecting the new date and time, entered my credit card details and pressed submit, the website crashed and came back with an error message. Checking my emails to make sure I didn't get an email to confirm - I re- entered the information and my credit card again. On later checking my emails, I not only received an email for the intial time I tried to change and got an error message, I also received another email which changed my inbound journey back to London which was very strange as I did not even see the return date mentioned. Only having selected the outbound journey to amend. As I was travelling in the US at the time I automatically went onto the online help and communicated to a customer service person what had happened. I was advised by the customer service person to call the helpline to get the change made and I explained that I could not do this as I was travelling on an Australian mobile and the cost to do this would be too high. I asked the customer service representative to make a note on my record that I had been in contact and advised that I would call the customer service  line as soon as I got to the UK. I also sent an email explaining the situation, hoping that I would get a response prior to having to make the call. I followed up by email every day and received not a single reply.\n\nWhen I called the customer service helpline I spoke to someone who said they were looking at what could be done. After being kept waiting for over 30 minutes on the line, I was informed that the only thing I could do was make an amendment at a charge of GBP 30.00 and pay any fare difference / which I was advised was now EUR 170.00. I pleaded with the person explaining that this issue was not my fault and I shouldn't be charged to make the change back to what the ticket was initially only to be told that I should have called the help desk at the time even though I had advised that this was not possible at the time and I had previously mentioned this to the online help person. I also asked why I had not received any response on the email I had sent (over a week ago) and was told that this was due to a backlog of emails ( not something to tell a customer to instill confidence in the service of a company). I believe my treatment and the total lack of understanding on what effective is a Eustostar issue is totally unacceptable. I have had to pay two sets of amendment fees and have got absolutely nowhere as Eurostar refused to make the chance to my ticket -after  actually being told that if my ticket was changed then the company would be loosing EUR 170.00 \" but hangon its my ticket in the first place\" so they are loosing nothing.\n\nI have subsequently had to book flights back from Paris due to a lunch commitment I am unable to break and also had to pay for a friends return tickets who I am travelling back with all because Eurostar refuse to make an amendment on what was a problem on their website. I see from some of the reviews that others have experienced issues with the Eurostar website. I am very mis- trusting of using this website again. Eurostar and their customer service team have totally spoilt my trip back to the UK to see my family after two years away. \n\nVery unhappy customer who would think twice about using Eurostar. I know   it is easy to get from London to Paris and back however if there are any deviations or issues it's a nightmare to get a response or and sympathy from  this company.\n\nJustin Brewer",

There's no alert, at least nothing caught my attention when I purchased the train/hotel through Eurostar affiliate partner lastminute.com.  When I re-read the Eurostar print out ticket, there's some very small letters below some ads that tells you this -- who READS everything if there's ads in between; put it to bold or larger words if you really want to alert people.  \n\nThen the outcome obvious is we miss the train and miss some of the events we plan to do.  \n\nWe then go to their ticket counter and they put us to a much later train, and we have to pay extra 30 pound per person.  We wait in line in the ticket counter and there're many people like us miss the train so apparently this is a common issue EuroStar aware, but do nothing to improve it.  Maybe this is a good way for them to collect extra money?\n\nTaking the train itself is fine, on time.  Check in is before boarding so after get off you can go straight out of the train station.",

Over the last few years all this has ebbed away and we're left with just the friendly, efficient staff, a poor website experience and uncomfortable trains. \n\nWith every update the website becomes more and more difficult to use and the new trains are just horrible. I've sat on more comfortable park benches. Sure they have wifi but that is the sole improvement. \nStrangely, the refurbished trains are better than the new ones but not by much. \n\nIf you travel from their Ebbsfleet station you are poorly served since they close the place at lunchtime (the last Brussels train leaves at 13:15) although you can get an evening train to Ebbsfleet. \nIf you have an early morning meeting you have no choice but to travel the morning before. \n\nI used to quite enjoy commuting between capital cities but not any more.",

        "review_text": "Worst customer service EVER. The company is obviously managed by a bunch of intellectually challenged people.\n\nSummary of my \"delightful\" trip to Disneyland: \nMy return journey was an absolute nightm\u00adare. On my ticket and in the email conta\u00adining my itinerary it clearly states that check in is 30/45 mins before departure Based on this info\u00adrmation I ensured th\u00adat I arrived at the station in time for check in. I arrive at the station where there are no clear signs regarding detai\u00adls of Eurostar check in and no help poin\u00adts. I wait outside the Eurostar check in station (which is closed) for 30 mins before it opens and they inform me that for my particular tic\u00adket I do not need to check in and that I \"need to go downsta\u00adirs\". I then proceed downstairs where I ask the information desk for assistance and they rudely advi\u00adce that I need to get a non eurostar tra\u00adin. The train to Lil\u00adle then arrives 18 mins late. We arrive at Lille at 5.15pm, leaving me 10mins to check in. The platf\u00adorm was packed and there was no clear si\u00adgnage showing where the Eurostar check in is and no visible staff. In the end I managed to find the check in after asking staff in the FX co\u00adunter. We finally lo\u00adcated the check in to be told that we mi\u00adssed it by 3 minutes! This has absolutely ruined mine and my daughters trip to Disneyland.",

        "review_text": "Travelled recently from London to Paris. Long story short there was a glitch with the system reading my wife's visa (no fault of ours). It would take overnight to resolve the visa issue due to the embassy being on public holiday. As a result the boarder security assured us Eurostar would transfer the ticket. Boarder security took us to the Eurostar desk in which they stated they would transfer the ticket after ping ponging us between multiple staff members. They said they would transfer once the visa issue had been resolved first. The visa issue was rectified overnight as expected and upon returning the next day Eurostar staff refused to honour there word. The treatment and attitude from the desk was the worst I've ever experienced. With my wife in tears they forced us to pay for a new ticket forfeiting our old one. The initial ticket was around 100 pounds for 2 people one way. The man at the counter with a big smug smile requests 395 pound for the new tickets knowing we had no other choice as we'd already spent a fortune in lost accomodation and additional hotel for the night. Absolutely disgusting company. I contacted the Eurostar help online thinking they would be appalled by this staff members attitude and honour the initial agreement but no this company are scum all the way from the top to bottom. Consider this a strong warning DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! FLY SWIM WALK BUT AVOID EUROSTAR AT ALL COSTS!",

        "review_text": "Eurostar is probably the worst traveling experience. Not only those idiots managed to replace old trains with newer ones that offer less comfort, less space and terrible design. Eurostar now has a new scam in place. If you arrive less than 30min before departure, say 28 minutes before the train as it's what happened to me today, they will charge \u00a330 to change your tickets. Obviously they charge for credit card fees on top. It used to be that they would offer some flexibility but they've now realised that their monopoly allowed them to just charge for whatever they pleased. The staff is untrained and odious. My 7-months pregnant wife could explain as much as she wanted that the reason for her 2-minutes tardiness was due to the fact that she was carrying a baby and she could not walk fast but that obviously did not matter. The waiting spaces are nasty and can only remain that way as no cleaning staff can be seen.  On top of that, their trains are most often late and sometimes from personal experience they will put you in the next train when they can't handle their check-in properly. Having no direct competitor, they obviously overcharge all their passengers as my roundtrip for two has now cost me close to \u00a3600. Overall I cannot really see any positive for this poorly managed enterprise. I just can't wait for a competitor to arrive. In the meantime, besides telling the world how useless Eurostar is, I feel  powerless.",

Unaware that the primary price for items was GBP i payed for my coffee and tickets in euro. (remember, this is a French company operating out of the EU). That was a serious error on my part because with the tourist rate around !.14 euro to the pound I was charged at the exorbitant rate of 1.39 to the pound. Not only is this a blatant rip-off, but the price of a carnet of 10 Paris Metro tickes was some 15% dearer than purchasing on arrival in Paris. A double whammy!

This happens even if it's not crowded.\n\nAlso poor Wi-Fi, uncomfortable new seats, overcrowded lounges, and an appalling overall organisation.\n\nEurostar should be ashamed of themselves.",

        "review_text": "Appalling service at Marne le vallee chessy station on Monday 6th March.\n\nOur train to Lille Europe (18.52) was delayed and we recieved no guidance from staff that it would be behind a train on the platform. \nThe information board stated our train would be at section H on the platform. It was in fact at section A behind another train. We had to run with a baby, pram and five suitcases and a child. The station staff member blew her whistle and was incredibly rude and watched us struggle. All the staff saw us struggle and yet they locked the doors so we could not get on and then the train went without us!\nWhilst running my baby and buggy nearly ended up in the gap between the platform and the train!\nHorrendous service!\nTwo minutes to load with such poor preparation from service announcements and station staff is downright ridiculous, even more so with so much luggage and baby and children and pram. In fact it was downright dangerous!! Had my baby and children ended up on the train without us or left on the platform without us, I would be initiating a lawsuit.\n\nWe finally arrived home four hours later than planned but at least we were still together. I'm absolutely appalled by the two minute loading time and the behaviour of Marne Le vallee station staff, \nThe outbound journey was not much better either and took a lady leaving her foot in the TGV door so that the train couldn't leave, just so that my husband could get all our luggage off (mainly the baby's dietary supplies!)",

        "review_text": "I cannot express in words how much I urge you all not to travel with Eurostar. Eurostar is a greedy company obsessed with money and filled with rude and unsympathetic staff. I don't think they have any compassion for their customers and I honestly think they see each one as a walking wallet, rather than a human being with a beating heart.\n\nMy journey on the way there went smoothly. I was surprised by how easy it was to book the train and how cheap it was. The journey was comfortable. \n\nHowever, this is all a complete allusion and the cheap prices online are completely shadow the ways in which the company try and rip people off. I accidentally booked my return ticket for the wrong date. This was my fault and I was prepared to pay a little extra to change this. \n\nI was made to pay almost \u00a3200 more for a ticket that originally cost \u00a328 for making a common mistake. This is completely indecent! I do not see how they expect everyone to afford this and I do not see what I person with small financial means would have done in this situation.\n\nWhen I inquired what I should do, the staff member was very frank with me and showed no sympathy or friendliness. I went to the desk. I found out how much I had to pay and inquired as to why it cost so much. Rather than offering me a clear and calm explanation, the staff member was extremely rude, blunt and unsympathetic. They raised their voice, gave me orders, spoke to me in an evidently angry tone and refused to offer any form of apology. This made me feel much more confused and upset. When I stood almost in tears, she did not even great me goodbye or offer any words of consolation or advice. To be honest, I have rarely been treated in this way. I can only compare this sort of behaviour to bullying on the school playground or to being told off as a naughty child by an adult. It is not how a member of staff should have spoken to a 19-year old customer for making a common mistake.\n\nI emailed Eurostar several times to complain about this and they persisted in telling me that nothing could be done. What is more, they treated me like a stupid person and implied that I had no knowledge of travel companies. They tried to justify their actions by comparing themselves to other travel companies, but I have not heard of any experiences similar to this with other companies. They have not replied to my most recent email and they have failed to give any reasonable explanation as to the way in which they ripped me off. They even tried to justify the behaviour of their staff members by calling it \"professional\".\n\nWherever you may be travelling, it is absolutely not worth travelling with Eurostar! They have no sense of common decency towards their customers. It is quite astounding!",

Why couldn't they e-mail me and let me choose a new seat - or a different train. Eventually I was given a forward facing seat right beside the constantly opening door to the very noisy kitchen car.

I missed a huge amount of time and plans I had in Amsterdam - something that to me is priceless.\n \nOn 2 January my ticket was scanned by staff onto the wrong train which meant I missed my connection and had to stay overnight at Brussels.  The first customer service desk I went to in Brussels was closing and the staff ignored me whilst I was obviously crying and upset.  The second desk was open but the staff only offered to put me on a free trip at lunch time the next day back to London and wouldn\u2019t pay for accommodation at that point.  I missed work and earning approximately 240 pounds that day because of Eurostar\u2019s incompetence.\n\nThey still will not give me any compensation and safe to say I will never be travelling with Eurostar again.",

        "review_text": "Eurostar:\n\n- Customer service exceptionally poor: Upon being delayed (we arrived at 1906 for a 1913 departure) due to the French public transport system the attitude of Eurostar staff was 'not my problem', British train or air operators would typically offer a goodwill gesture of unfilled seats on a later journey in this scenario (at no cost to them) - however Eurostar's French staff had no interest in this and instead stuck rigidly to their autocratic conditions of carriage, charging my partner and I an 80 Euro fine, we could barely afford. My partner was in tears by this point, the staff at the booking office showed no compassion whatsoever and coldly informed her she'd have to pay the fine.\n\n- Once on the train the train was extremely overheated, I assume as a cynical attempt to sell a greater amount of refreshments and a sliding door between carriages violently shut on my hand, grazing my skin (granted relatively mildly, but this was the icing on the cake by this point).\n\n- The train back was an almost constant set of announcements for the buffet, travel tickets onward they sell on board etc. - if this were a Ryanair flight, I wouldn't expect any less - but for a supposedly premium service, this is not what I would hope for.\n\nI would strongly advise anyone thinking Eurostar is a cheaper or more convenient experience to flying or boat travel to reconsider, as this experience has certainly put me off for life.\n\nGare Du Nord:\n\n-The station has incredibly poor signage. I don't have any particular requirement for signs in English, as I speak passable french - however finding the Eurostar terminal from the RER was extremely difficult involving wandering around the station until finding an exit signed 'mainline' upon leaving in this direction there were eventually signs to Eurostar. Neither 'mainline' or 'eurostar' were signed until this point however. Very very poor.",

Unfortunately we got there about 6.25, still 25 mins left to catch the train and it was not busy hours. staff there didn't let us through and each staff kept asking us to see a different staff and no one was a help and they were arrogant and aggressive, it was a disappointment that we have enough time and they were dragging us along. each one of us end up paying extra to catch the next train. we sit there for our next train and the boarding only started 15 mins before the departure. we see people walking in 5 mins before the departure to other trains and we feel that we were picked on and it was unfair. It ruined our morning and our trip, my friends and I wont travel on eurostar again and I wont encourage anyone to travel on eurostar again. they are greedy, rude and arrogant company.",

Anyway, the amazingly quick witted managers Stefan and George managed to track me down and accompany my bag on the next train to London! I am so grateful to them and all of the staff. All I had to do was wait in the cushy confines of Pret a Manger, eating my egg mayo sandwich, until my purse was delivered to me in person by Stefan. If that's not great customer service then I don't know what is! In other news, the Eurostar cheese and ham toastie is delicious and the white wine not to Chablis....",

For the same price as a ticket from Stansted, you get to travel straight from St Pancras to central Brussels. The only suggestion I have is to cooperate with Thalys to have one integrated service to the Netherlands. Right now, with all the high speed rail issues we've experienced in the Benelux, it is a right pain to have to change to a slow train from Brussels to the Netherlands. I spend as much time on the Brussels to Holland train as on the Eurostar, despite living on the Dutch-Belgian border (less than an hour by car). That's a true pity. I know you're not the same company, but at least you could start a joint venture for a combines Thalys-Eurostar service!",

        "review_text": "My train leaving Paris at 19:01 was cancelled because of problems in the Channel tunnel. When I arrived at Gare du Nord, the Eurostar area was closed off and very little information available. After 10 or 15 minutes, a woman came out and told us there were no more trains that day and they had no ability to help us at the station. She asked us to leave the station and use the website to rebook.\n\nEurostar offered no assistance finding a hotel. The rebooking processing via the website took over 2 hours to come back with a new booking via email. I tried to ring Eurostar but they would not reply.\n\nEventually I was rebooked on a train the next morning. When I arrived at Gare du Nord, there were huge queues and nobody providing information. It was not clear how to get my new ticket. The queues were so long they had to postpone the train's departure. Eventually, after much hassle I got back to London.\n\nI was surprised that Eurostar had such a hard time dealing with disruptions on the line. These happen fairly often. I have experienced disruptions on airlines and they help finding hotels and getting meals. Eurostar offered no help at all.\n\nI'm now trying to claim back my expenses and compensation. This is also proving very difficult.\n\nThe whole experience has been characterized by extremely poor customer service by Eurostar. I will avoid them in the future.",

We had to pay 80 euros to travel an hour later on a train with many free seats. That train was late arriving, which caused us to just miss our next train. Result \u00a3160 extra just because of some patronising jobsworth who didn't like English people - no doubt fuelled by Brexit sadly.\nSince discovered it would have been easier and cheaper to fly to our destination near Limoges which is what I am doing next week.

The operative apologised and said he was off to replenish his trolley. Unfortunately when his trolley was replenished he commenced serving from the rear of our carriage and ran out AGAIN when he reached us.   I would also point out that we appeared to be the only 2 people travelling together.  He apologised profusely and he and a female colleague went in search of our meal. Sadly to no avail.  We were then offered something from the on board cafe. We went to look at the menu and we're disappointed to see bread, bread, bread, wraps and again bread !!!!! Exactly what we wanted to avoid.  Full marks to the operative he tried to reassure us that the food from the cafe cost Eurostar much more than the salmon we might have had. He did try to lighten the load but bottles of wine where not what we wanted or expected. Eurostar you need to up your game.

        "review_text": "I have used your Eurostar service from London to Paris on Friday July 8th at 14:01. This service was heavily delayed by one hour. This caused me a lot of problems and in the end was unable to enjoy my trip due to the lateness of my arrival.\n\nThe staff on this service did not keep to the promised times that the service was to arrive and kept changing this throughout the journey. The last announcement was that the service was going to arrive at 17:40, it in fact arrived just before 18:00.\n\nThe train was also dirty and the toilets disgusting! The staff on the buffet were very unhelpful and not at all interested. The staff told me to speak with the train manager who was nowhere to be seen throughout the journey, he simply hid away somewhere on the train!!\n\nOn my departure from Paris to London on Sunday July 10th at 19:01 the service was yet again delayed. I had become unwell at this point with stress, worry & extremely frustrated. I feel that the service in the station were not helpful and inefficient.\n\nWhen I boarded this service people were allowed to sit with Standard Premier class passenger\u2019s who had standard tickets. This I feel was unprofessional and does not make any of the people in this coach feel the value of the ticket. These people were very noisy causing disturbance & people were unhappy. I booked this ticket so I could avoid such noise. My friend travelled with me as I was not well. She was helping me at my seat and when the food finally came to my table I had asked my friend to try it for me as I cannot eat certain foods. The train manager was very rude to us and was not at all helpful. When I used the toilet the cabinet between the coaches with the controls inside was left open and was dangerous and I nearly hit my head on it. There are witnesses to this should you wish to investigate this.\n\nThe wi-fi was also not working in my coach so I was unable to communicate with family to let them know that I was being delayed again. The service in the buffet car was totally unacceptable and my friend had to wait half an hour to be served.\n\nIn my five years of travelling with Eurostar I feel this will now have to be my last Eurostar journey as a result of all the upset & illness you have caused me.",

        "review_text": "I haven't used Eurostar yet but the ease of booking is incredibly easy. I booked my trip to Paris via the Eurostar app and it was booked within a minute, however - you can only book a train from London in the UK, I don't live in London so I had to book another train ticket separately or go onto the desktop website to book it from Birmingham (which to me - seems counterproductive as what's the point in having the app?) so on a whole, the UX on the app is good if you're living in London but anywhere else in the UK? Not so much...\nEDIT: I forgot to review my journey with Eurostar. Absolutely incredible! I started my journey in Birmingham New Street to London Euston then a quick switch from Euston to St Pancras International. What a beautiful train station! I absolutely loved the check in barriers, where you can scan your mobile boarding pass too! Security was fast, went from check in, through body scanners, and through border control in less than 3 minutes! No need to take your shoes or jacket off, either! The departure lounge had a plethora of seating and was spacious. We boarded around 20 minutes before departure. I traveled on the new E320, I thoroughly enjoyed the new train, very spacious and clean. We left bang on time. I love the in train entertainment and the on board bar! I arrived in Gare du Nord a few minutes late but it didn't really matter. The return journey was just as great, I would wholeheartedly recommend using Eurostar. I paid \u00a377 from Birmingham to Paris, which was much cheaper than flying and is much, much better! Look forward to use again, Eurostar!",

This was not a problem to me and understandable in the circumstances. However I was not expecting to be surcharged to use Eurostar's own commercial service to transport my knife to London. Providing misinformation on their website to allow them to commercially exploit  customers in the current tragic situation in Brussels is a shameful and despicable act. The surcharge of \u20ac20 is out of all proportion to effort involved in securely transporting the item. Accurate information on the website would allow passengers to decide whether or not to take a penknife of not before setting out.\r\n\r\nGiven the clear lack of travellers (only 4 people in my coach), Eurostar should be supporting and welcoming those still travelling with them.\r\n\r\nI have written to Eurostar on the matter but they have not deemed me worthy of a response.\r\n\r\nI",

        "review_text": "Useless, arrogant, rude, aggressive staff with a sense of \"entitlement\" - not that you (or I), the customer, would be entitled to anything, just to follow orders. They don't even deserve the 1 star I am forced to give them.\r\n\r\nThe best you'll get is in Standard class, where you don't see any staff, just sometimes one of them walking past with a look on their face that says \"I'm busy, don't you dare bother me!\". That's the absolute best you'll ever get. Don't even think of paying a premium. As you upgrade, the don't-bother-me staff becomes a crossbreed between ticket inspectors and door bouncers. And don't expect any extra service for your money - there is none.\r\n \r\nHaving presented my ticket a first time at the check-in turnstiles, I arrived at the door of my \"Standard Premier\" carriage with one piece of luggage in each hand and a heavy rucksack on my back (within the baggage limits). I was greeted by a demand to see my ticket a second time. I wouldn't even have dreamt of a little help with my luggage, this would have been a five-star service, and who says that you should expect any extra service if you pay a premium? No, I simply asked if I could drop my luggage in the racks in the carriage first, prior to showing her my ticket. \"No, it's the rule, and it's applicable to everyone\". And the row escalated, and escalated... e.g. the same female \"door bouncer\" later coming to see me in my seat with her boss demanding an apology! \r\n\r\nIf I had paid for a standard ticket, at least nobody would have bothered me, I could have dropped my luggage and settled in my seat without fuss. I paid a premium, and I was treated as if I were a liar and a cheater - because of course, if I present myself at a \"Standard Premium\" carriage door, and if I don't show my ticket instantly, it must be that I am trying to access a carriage that is not mine. In a way, I was treated even worse than if I hadn't paid the price premium.\r\n\r\nI will not be treated like this by the very people whom I am contributing to pay. Airlines (none of them) don't treat you that way. Actually, one of them, which was East Midlands based, used to employ staff with the same sense of entitlement, greater than your rights as a customer. They are now defunct. On the return leg of my Eurostar journey, there were at least 8 empty seats in my carriage. In future, there will be a ninth empty seat, and I can't wait for the day when Eurostar goes bust and all these Eurostar people can claim the last of their \"entitlement\", i.e. JSA - or when at least HS1 and the equivalent high-speed railtracks on the continent side will be really open to competition, with another train operator being allowed to operate a service on the same line. Until such a time, I'm afraid they will continue to feel \"entitled\". In the meantime, one thing they are not entitled to is my custom; Eurostar have lost my custom for the rest of my life. They will never ever get one more penny of my money. It may take maybe an extra 30 minutes door-to-door, but flying is cheaper and you get some customer service.",

A while later she came into our humble fist class carriage( in name only) stating all the papers were not wanted I could have one  if I wanted. I said I no longer wanted it at which point she began to loudly berate us in front if passenger's telling us we had 'only paid' for standard premier not full first class and we're not entitled to a complimentary newspaper.\r\nShe then departed locking the compartment door open do as to cause a draft, glared at us every time she stormed through the carriage. A cold  (no warm choice) supper was served complete with a cracked dirty glass and lipstick smear.No champagne in our compartment even though on the phone I was told there would be one complimentary glass.\r\nAfter complaining to Eurostar as this was a birthday surprise and the day was ruined, they were completely indifferent and basically did not care that have an unhinged person working for them on their trains.\r\nMy advice if you must go Eurostar DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UPGRADING as you get nothing for it. Staff don't treat you as a first class passenger and clearly see you as an annoyance. Next time I shall FLY where the airlines  VALUE their  customers and take complaints seriously.

Every so many meter's there was a ramp to board the train i asked a staff member if i could board the train using the ramp, i was told NO just no -  no further conversation! Walked on to the next ramp, able bodied family of six boarded the train using the ramp staff member standing next to the ramp did not say a word . My husband asked if i could use the ramp showing the scan with the screw's holding my ankle together and again told no.By now clearly distressed walked to the next ramp told the same. No alternative but to use the step to board the train where i promptly fell on to my knee's.Lucky i was not hurt but, this could have ruined my holiday.\r\nClearly the disabled are not welcome at Eurostar.Staff don't care.!!!",

I learned that if anything happens at all on the Eurostar, you are left to your own device with no help from staff except unprofessionalism, contempt, mockery and sarcasm. \r\n\r\nAs I was resting in my seat, a woman tripped as she walked down the aisle and she hit my face as she fell. I realised it was bad after a few minutes when it started to swell and I had to wipe off blood dripping down my face. I asked the train manager for help in French and English, but he said there was nothing he or Eurostar could do as they are \"neither doctors nor the police\". He said they were not allowed to have first aid kits on board for \"legal reasons\". Later, the train manager claimed he didn't understand I wanted medical care (don't ask me what he thought I wanted pointing at my bleeding face!). \r\n\r\n\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t understand your French\u201d his colleague said. This comment is utterly offensive in any circumstance on a \u201ctrilingual\u201d Eurostar service. It was especially offensive in this case as his colleague chose to insult and humiliate an injured customer instead of showing professionalism (let alone showing basic human empathy). \r\n\r\nOn arrival in London, the same staff repeated that \u201cit was my fault for not asking for a doctor\u201d, and when I asked for medical care on the station, the same rude staff member was extremely inappropriate again: \u201cOh poor you. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to call for a wheelchair too?. She continuously scorned and verbally abused me as a passenger, using insult and humiliation while I was injured and bleeding from my face. \r\n\r\nI asked if at least they will could write some report about the accident, noting down what happened and the people involved. He then answered \"This is not our problem. It has nothing to do with us. It is between you and the woman who fell. You can ask for her name yourself. It was only an accident anyway\". I replied that I have never seen the woman who fell, I have no idea where she sits and do not want walk around looking for somebody while my face is bleeding. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou should have pulled the red handle if you needed helped after the accident\u201d they said. I understood the red handle was only to be used for imminent dangers, so that is why I had looked for staff who were unhelpful in the end.",

I found this treatment inacceptable as they were lying to me when I first contacted them. it was a very painful experience to get stuck first a good 1/2 hour in the tunnel without any information from them regarding the incident and then in London without any compensation.  I am sure I will not take the Eurostar again although I am travelling 5-6 times to London per year for work. My choice is now Air France.",

        "review_text": "I used Euro Star for a weekend break to Paris 3 weeks ago and it was bliss. None of the usual stress associated with the airport. You board in the centre of London and are hurried through to the centre of Paris in just a couple of hours. There may not be as much to do whilst waiting as you get at the airports, but then I normally end up buying something and then getting stung for extra luggage charges on the way back! The train is quick, spacious and relatively quiet (Ok \u2013 there were a few excited kids en-route to Paris before EuroDisney, but not much EuroStar can do about that!). Gare de Nord (although I had heard horror stories) was great, no worse than London stations, and the staff who were rumoured to be unhelpful couldn\u2019t have been nicer. All-in-all \u2013 Great!",

        "review_text": "Eurostar must have the most hopeless website on the net. Try searching on google for Bruges and you end up with Eurostar \u00a379 tickets but..to nowhere. You'll go round and round in circles but you will never find the \u00a379 ticket. You'll be lucky to find Bruges unless it's on an expensive short break. Time waster companies like this should be banned from the net as they simply waste people's time and harass customers by their rubbish websites. I am extremely angry having wasted my time on this site. The only way to get to Bruges is probably to go to a Eurostar station to get the information...assuming the desk is open that is which at Ashford it very rarely is. I would suggest this company sack their useless IT team who clearly have no idea how to design a website for customers and get some qualified IT people to sort it out. For a guide to this please visit National Rail Enquiries. Its straightforward no messing about website and is obviously designed by people with good customer focus and IT skills.",

        "review_text": "My review is specifically meant to help travellers using Eurorail/Interrail passes.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of using the Eurostar trains when travelling between France/Belgium and the UK is a promissing alternative to flying. The regular tickets are quite expensive compared to flights from basically anywhere in Europe but in coordination with the Globalpass travellers get a slight discount.\r\n\r\nThe actual method of travelling is recommendable since it is fairly easy to board, the seats are of similar quality to discount flights and you travel from the centre of Paris to the centre of London.\r\n\r\nGlobalpass holders must be aware of some difficulties when it comes to booking. If you really make an effort and look for it both the Eurorail and the Eurostar websites explains that booking can only be done at the booking offices and per telephone. Booking should be done a couple of weeks in advance, so you need to fly to either Paris or London before planning to visit the places a couple of weeks later in order to book your tickets. That of course is ridiculous why I called their booking office - waited for what seemed like forever until my credits were used up spending 20 euros and without tickets.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I book the seats online, pay the full price for the cheapest tickets I could find and hope for some understanding due to mitigating circumstances.\r\n\r\nI go to the sales office at the trainstation in an attempt to solve the problem but they did not know how. In their defence the young girl was very polite and understanding but she could only give me a card of a person I should contact.\r\n\r\nI have now received the 3rd email from Eurostars customer care telling me that Eurostar has no interest in helping me and that Eurorail should have helped me better. No matter the circumstances they refuse to even acknowledge the problem and have yet to even ask to see my Europass.  \r\n\r\nA very simple matter made very complicated. I was entitled to a reduced price but being on eurorail through out Europe I was unable to \"follow the conditions\" of the exact same special Eurorail ticket.\r\n\r\nSo far they have successfully hid behind their conditions which is their right. I could just have flown to Paris, ordered the tickets and flown back to where ever I was at the time. That seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nI am just asking: \"Why pay extra for bad service?\"\r\n\r\nEurostar - Bad service and condecending traveller care will haunt those who do not make an effort.\r\n\r\nAll in all: If your are Eurorailing in Europe having the time of your life - Book a flight if you need to cross the Channel.",
