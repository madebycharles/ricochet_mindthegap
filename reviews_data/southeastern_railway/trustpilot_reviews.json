No notification and no ticket received but payment was still taken from my Barclays account without me realising. Day after, I tried to process through PayPal, same again. PayPal reimbursed me but the other payment still hasn't. Contacted the station, no complaints can be processed from there. Tried calling a few times but was just on hold. Made a complaint online to which they did answer by referring me to the online retail team without telling me how to liaise with them. No obvious link on their app.\nSoutheastern, this is really poor. Get your customer service sorted and an easy way for clients to complain and be refunded.\nAdvice is stay away from their app. If things go wrong, you're not likely to gey money back",

I get halfway down the platform  only to see it pull out If anybody at Southeastern is reading this review. Which I doubt Just for once can you consider needs of passengers and reschedule times to allow passengers changing trains a chance to catch connections In other words passengers before profit",

        "review_text": "This company is a joke and there delay repay doesn't work. I bought a peak ticket from Greenhithe to London Terminals on 2nd April 2024. I took the 08:00 train to London Waterloo East which departed 12 minutes late. We were then told that the train will be cancelled in London Bridge which we got there at 09:11. I then waited for another train on the other of the platform to get to Waterloo East which was by the way packed like sardines due to the cancellation. I arrived in Waterloo East just under 30 minutes later. I submitted a delay repay and got rejected 3 times. I don't know if they company is recording their trains that are running late correctly so that they won't issue delay repay to their customer. I normally buy off peak but this day I had to be in the office at a certain time due to a meeting which I was 30 mins late due to this very UNRELIABLE train company.\n\nP.S. When the train was delayed on that day I took a screenshot when I got to London Bridge which was taken at 09:11. The time on the app showed that the train arrived from Greenhithe to London Bridge at 08:45 even it didnt. Watch out other commuters as this company is trying to evade paying delay repay to their paying customers.",

To make matters worse, they don't even factor in that the delays from Cannon Street could result in the customer having to wait further 15mins, plus any delays to that service.

In order to collect the ticket form the machine, the machine required a physical card to be inserted (though they will not take any money). I did not have any other cards except my AMEX card which the machine refused to accept so I approached the ticket office. There was only one officer at the ticket office and there were two group of people in front of me, one group was on the side because of a ticket on a machine but didn\u2019t get their ticket - that machine do not belong to southeastern - you can tell that it will take ages for this group due to the issue. He served the second group on the queue first instead, then he refused to serve me. I explained that I just needed to collect the ticket, the train is in 5 minutes, I literally needed two minutes for the ticket to be printed for me and I cannot collect from the machine because I do not have a card. He refused and ask me to step aside and say I can miss the train and there will be other trains - I needed to be on that train to be home before 4:30 for an appointment. I explained the same to another female officer at the barrier, who probably heard the conversation and also refused to let me through despite showing confirming of booking with exact time of the train. Im totally uttered service. They charging a fortune and increase the price everyday yet a lot of the times we\u2019re required to stand throughout the journey - I travel on south eastern at least twice a week and 50% of the time I am standing with no seat. Of course I have no choice but to still travel with them because they\u2019re the only train provider from Folkestone to St Pancras/Stratford internationals but I have to put this review here. I also feel discriminated by the officer at the ticket office, served the individual before me but not me. They were all white and I\u2019m Asian. Maybe I\u2019m over thinking but I am strongly feeling that race plays a part here.  ",

Today around 6pm, I boarded my train, and there was not one clean seat. All the seats had crumbs on it, very dusty and very dirty. There was a weird dampy smell throughout the train as well. In addition, the trains are never maintained properly. The doors separating the carriages half the time don\u2019t even open properly, or on my train, only half the door opens but immediately slams shut. The windows are so rusty you can\u2019t even open them. Yet year on year my fares are sky rocketing and I\u2019m reading on the news that railway fares are set to go up AGAIN in April? Where\u2019s all the revenue from fares going because it\u2019s clearly evident that Southeastern does not hire any cleaners. I understand it may be difficult to keep clean trains throughout the day but at 7.30am somedays? Come on! I mean I never see anyone picking up litter in the trains in between services. I can guarantee you they probably last cleaned the seats 15 years ago. A very shambolic organisation. I haven\u2019t touched upon the reliability of services, but as many other reviews will tell you, constant cancellations, and I was once told by Station staff at Cannon Street that there was a shortage of drivers, and 2 services were cancelled. This is actually pathetic, considering the DFT directly runs and operates Southeastern! ",

Replacement bus services at weekends are common place.   I was late for work this morning due to yet another cancellation. On cold winter mornings, the waiting room is often closed.  You are lucky if you can get a seat. For this, I have to pay sky high ticket prices.  I would give Southeastern's service 0 stars were it possible.

Fewer trains; delays and cancellations as before.\n\nMany of the trains have no toilets on board and those that have often have toilets out of order. By the way, teenage boys often break the toilet door mechanisms for fun which leads to toilets falling into disrepair.\n\nThe new City Beam trains cause motion sickness. Seat fabric is often torn / worn on older Networker trains.\n\nThe Delay Repay compensation system rarely seems to pay out. Ticket prices are high for a substandard service. Stations are often unstaffed and facilities often locked shut.\n\nAnd Southeastern wonder why people prefer the new Elizabeth Line ..?",

I complained to Southeastern and was told that the ticket office was closed due to staff annual leave! What sort of a company doesn't allow for cover when arranging annual leave? I've never worked for one. For my follow up appointments, I will be using the bus. It may take longer, but it's cheaper. Pathetic.",

Guaranteed time wasting examples:\nOnline chat goes nowhere, can only deal with the most basic standard queries.\nThe 0345 322 7021 helpline number strangely connects with TFL on one option, for no obvious reason.\nThe 61016 text number is for POLICE only.\nOnline queries and refunds only cover the southeastern part of any journey, not any onward travel tickets purchased on Southeastern.\nThe online form does not appear to have a \"send\" button?\nTried WhatsApp:- no reply.\nIn the event of a strike or other problem affecting Southeastern trains - you may realise that you should have booked on any other online booking system.",

I will be informing the southeastern company headquarters again (not the first time I have done this)  also as always I presume I will get no reply because I don't usually get a response. The Southeastern Railway company in my opinion is completely ridiculous and I feel like nothing has been done addressed to meet any issues that are arrising constantly. Trains are never up to standards in hygiene and cleanliness, all services are never usually on time. Staff are not particularly helpful either in they way that they don't normally seem to know or have much experience. Basically everything is wrong and needs to be improved drastically.

        "review_text": "Yesterday I travelled from London to Canterbury West from St Pancras on the Margate train. It was the 16.46. I think. The train was on good time, clean and with excellent facilities for phone charging too. When  I alighted at Canterbury West the station was busy and staff were vigilant the whole time ensuring passengers needing assistance  alighted and boarded safely. The platform was clean and tidy and there was just a sense of all the staff  being totally engaged and providing a great service to the passengers they served. Some went above and beyond anything I would have expected of them! I left my phone plug  on the train to Margate and spoke to John and his colleague  who were on duty on the platform. They were just so pleasant and helpful and did all they could to retrieve my plug. They phoned ahead to Margate to let them know it was still on board, phoned me back an hour later to say it was recovered and I could pick it up the next day at Canterbury West which I have just done. Once again I was greeted with such kindness by staff on duty there today. Thank you John and Chris and the other staff at Canterbury West for a great job well done. I can\u2019t thank you all enough for taking the time to do all you did and showing everyone there that despite what we read in the news etc there are still plenty of people in this country who DO take a pride in the job they do and make such a difference to those they come in contact with.

Despite recent refurbishment there are only a very small number of ticket machines and all of them had long queues. When I finally reached the start of the queue, I found that the new ticket machines do not provide the facility to buy a ticket starting from another station or zone. As I have a zone 1-6 travelcard, in order to buy a ticket, I had join another long queue at the small ticket office and most of the service windows there were closed. This delayed my journey significantly.\n\nI think London Bridge southeastern ticket machines are the only ones in London that don't allow the customer to purchase a ticket that starts from another station.

        "review_text": "I booked my ticket on the southeastern app and then loaded it onto The Key ( southeastern travel card ). I had made it to my local station ( Greenhithe ). Tapped in and then made my way to the platform. it was good to see a mostly clean station with accessibility lifts on both platforms. After waiting for my train I boarded a fairly clean train and to my surprise, the heating was on. This made a good addition to my journey as it was freezing out. The train was in good condition with working toilets and priority seats. I had switched to Hither Green to continue my journey to Grove park. After a swift 45 minutes, I made it to my destination on time. I would give southeastern five stars but the reason I am giving it a four is that 2 different types of trains that I have been on had no toilets.",

No you receive a reference number and then have to go and collect a physical ticket. You look on google, apparently e-tickets are not the standard because these people live in the 1920s, it says download the app, you manage to download the app, you try to load your ticket and it doesn\u2019t allow to obtain an e-ticket, you\u2019re just left with a reference number. All of this is just very curious, these people have clearly decided the wrong career path or simply the wrong century. Hard to imagine this level of stupidity.",

        "review_text": "On the 26th August I travelled from Stratford International (dep 12.19pm) to Canterbury West (arr 1.06pm). The train started from St Pancras International and I boarded the train in the front carriage.\n\nI suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and find it very difficult to stand for any longer than about 5 minutes (my condition means that I sweat profusely when my body becomes stressed e.g. standing).\n\nI have no problems with trains being highlighted as standing room only (although this is a surprise in the middle of the day, not so much surprise though when the train is only 6 carriages).\n\nThe real problems that I have are twofold:\n\n1. that passengers are squeezed in like sardines (because of short trains) while there are so many 6 carriage sets sitting in the depot at Ashford doing absolutely nothing and which could be used to alleviate overcrowding on trains,\n\n2. travelling on this route commands a premium fare. Yes, for some, a premium fare to stand-up for the entirety of their journey. \n\nIsn't it about time that carriage sets aren't left in the depot at Ashford (and maybe there are a few other sets elsewhere too) but are used to alleviate overcrowding that Southeastern are totally aware of and are able to predict?",

Its something else when southeastern railway staff do it. OK, if they were already providing us, the public with a service comparable with the German service, for example, I too would be right behind their cause. However, the truth is that southeastern rail are completely abysmal. I was actually sat on the train ready to depart from the station and without warning a mumbled voice comes over the tannoy system to announce the train cancelled. The reason was the Charing Cross train, sat on the adjacent platform, didn't have a guard and clearly that train was more important than my one hence they took our guard off and put them on that one? Absolutely ridiculous. I'm currently on a 3 month probation at my new job so don't want to be late for work and yet in 4 weeks they've done it more times than I can remember. I paid \u00a36.20 and when I claimed compensation was given \u00a31.20 after nearly 2 weeks of waiting. The only reason I have given one star is because I can't give zero. Useless company, useless staff. Rant over.",

Even if I'd known that SE won't refund to my mastercard, I'd only have the credit card used to purchase/collect the tickets with me.  Luckily today I was at home & used my laptop to apply and found an old Visa card in a drawer.  Now I'll have to use the Visa card for a purchase in order to benefit from the refund!

The grey and yellow coloured trains are no better either with equally as uncomfortable seats and no toilets! In fact it's ironic that their best and most comfortable trains are the good old original ones that are 30 years old with the blocks of 6 and 4 blue seats as they actually have a toilet on board although it's a bit of a lottery as to whether they will be in service or not.

So it was  suggested that we go  over to platform 1 to go to Otford to catch  a semi fast train to Bromley South which doesn't  stop at Eynsford. So we did so, and then it decided to  stop at Eynsford.  So it took from 15.35 to 17.25 to get  to Bromley South on the hottest day so far. Absolutely disgusting.  South East Trains should be ashamed of the service they attempt to run. They want  more money!!!!!",

This person appeared to have some issues and should not be in a customer facing role, especially as vulnerable people may be using the station, assuming that he was actually a member of the customer facing team. And if staff are now going to be moved out of ticket offices and onto platforms and station concourses, please consider vetting your staff before doing so, in the interests of your customers and the reputation of your company.

        "review_text": "Train cancelled by Southeastern! \nMy brief London trip on 29 December to meet overseas family visiting London is now impossible - I haven't seen them for 3 years!\nOn top of causing massive disappointment, to obtain a refund, I am now forced to POST the tickets I had bought online and printed at the train station machine, AT MY EXPENSE, even though Southeastern is aware of the Royal Mail postal delays, backlogs, and lots of letters going missing.\nIn a digital age where everything is online, why can't the tickets just be made 'void', rather than inconvenience me further and add to environmental pollution, since I am now forced to DRIVE to a post office to get a stamp and post the letter? What an abysmal service!!!!\nWill I ever see my money again? Not hopeful.\nUPDATE: Received nonsensical copy-paste reply with wrong travel dates quoted, and refund declined as I'd bought an advance ticket. I'v just replied stating trip was NOT cancelled by me, so full refund is due. I will escalate to the Rail Ombudsman if next response is equally rubbish.\nUPDATE #2: After 7 days of silence from the original idiot that rejected my request for a refund, I just received an email from another 'advisor' telling me that yes, I was correct about my entitlement to have the tickets refunded and that compensation is on its way.\nMoral of the story: SOUTHEASTERN TRAINS WILL LIKELY REJECT YOUR CLAIM EVEN THOUGH IT'S VALID, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WOULD GIVE UP AT THAT STAGE, UNAWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS. IF YOU DO KNOW YOUR RIGHTS, HOWEVER, AND SOUTHEASTERN CANCELLED THE SERVICE YOU PRE-PAID, MAKE IT CLEAR, STAND YOUR GROUND, AND SOUTHEASTERN WILL PAY UP.",

        "review_text": "Seriously think twice, and then twice again if you are thinking of moving to any location that relies solely on Southeastern rail, particularly if you need to commute regularly. The trains are late 9 times out of 10. If they are not late they are cancelled. Toilets are consitently disgusting. For the last 5 years where I live there have been no trains at weekends because of engineering works. The trains are often held for long periods between stations with no announcement or explanation from the driver. \n\nPlumstead is particularly bad for ticket inspectors who are there every month and are the most condescending rude people you will ever have the misfortune to meet. Moreover they cant explain why they keep targeting Plumstead (I know why). Also, staff at Plumstead stand smoking right in front of the station entrance billowing their dirty stinking smoke in the faces of people entering and leaving the station. Asking them for help at the service desk results in you being treated like an inconvenience. What a great representation of your company. Thank the heavens for the Elizabeth line which has enabled me to abandon this trash of a 'service' permanently.\n\nAlso, don't think you can just ruck up a couple of minutes early to catch your intended train. Oh no no no, you will be playing with fire - you need to catch the train before your intended one to make sure you get wherever you're going on time, and to make sure you dont miss your next connecting train.\n\nIf you have any real intention of regularly being on time please walk, cycle, take the bus or drive. If you have no other choice, my advice would be to catch the earlier train and use the southeastern website to keep track of late running and cancelled trains before you leave your house.",

The women took the ticket out of the machine and said just use it coming back as I also had proof of purchase online.\n\nOn return, I approached the staff who was not very helpful.  Told me I need to buy another ticket. I explained what her colleague had advised but she was adamant there was nothing she could do and told me to buy another ticket. \n\nI said I was about to miss my train and that I had work, she said she'd call the manager but when the manager arrived she looked at me and said sorry there's nothing we can do. All 4 members of staff were looking at me with some kind of disgust. \n\nThen a white guy come along with no ticket, the women just let him out. \n\nI missed my train and had to buy another ticket. \n\nWhen I got to London Bridge, my ticket didn't work, however the treatment I got at London Bridge was so much more empathetic. I explained what had happened in Tunbridge Wells and I was told I should have got their names because their treatment of me was unnecessary.\n\nI still feel quite upset about the situation as those staff members had some kind of hate towards me. It can only be one reason because I'm a liked person with a loving friendly character. \n\nI'd like to know what will be done to prevent anyone else from experiencing this kind of ' customer care', as it has left a very bitter taste in my mouth.",

WRONG.\n\nHanded tickets over EVENTUALLY. Now 30 seconds or thereabouts. So I ran up the steps and down the other side. I even got to the door with my hand outstretched - perhaps 2 or 3 inches from the button. \n\nDoors locked. No coincidence in the timings.\n\nI walked back to the kiosk and there was our lovely public servant with a nice smug grin on his face at 0748 on the 6th August 2022. \n\nThat's a person who should be in a business that has a public-facing side and all of that at a time when public support is beneficial for the pay rise he so richly deserves.

I had to use 3 Paper tickets and after a lot of chew got  refunds from SE Trains after 14 days, The Twitter service I must say is excellent  for updates and replies are instant when there are disruptions on the line( many in mid July ! ) and a huge thumbs up to all behind the scenes. The HST trains are better than LNER in fact as regards comfort. Again many thanks to the SE team which must have been a nightmare for refunds ( then and now )for my unused tickets.",

I guess Southeastern could improve some of their service on the routes down via Hastings and Canterbury East and also improve their toilets. Last time I traveled from St Pancras International to Canterbury West, it took only a bit over half an hour!\nSoutheastern\u2019s drivers are very kind and sometimes train whistle at me, and the guards onboard have helped me several times.\nI still need to travel on a CityBeam though, I\u2019ll do that soon, but thank you Southeastern for getting me where I want to go at the speed of light, not just High Speed, Victoria, Cannon Street and Charing X trains are fast too!

This has happened countless times on my commute. There is never an explanation so it's  one star for communication as well.\n\nUpdate: If I could give no stars I would. Today the service terminated (again) in Ramsgate. I, unfortunately, had my earphones in. The next thing I know, I'm returning to Canterbury. Nobody came through the carriages. So, is it now a liability to listen to your music on Southeastern trains lest they make an announcement? When I asked the guard what was going on, he was surly, rude, and tried to blame me with words to the effect that it was my responsibility. When I questioned this assumption and suggested that (im)proper staffing levels might be responsible, he tried to get support from other passengers. So, in effect, he tried to gather his army to raise up against me. Needless to say, nobody responded because in their hearts they know the ugly truth. Southeastern is, indeed, diabolical (in the true meaning of the word; 'diabolus' / devil).\n\nUpdate: 13.04.22. Again, the service from Canterbury West was delayed and rather continue to its intended destination, Margate, it terminated in Ramsgate. This left all of the passengers to hot foot it to the Victoria service  which was sardine like. The carriage clearly hadn't been cleaned and stunk of vomit. Not wanting to catch Covid or endure the smell of vomit, I took the bus. The train pain continues.",

        "review_text": "On the whole, I have had no issues with Southeastern Railway except for one time in June of 2019. On that occasion, we went to London via Southern Railway for a concert at Wembley. We didn't make the last train back from Victoria as it had been cancelled. so we had to catch one via a Southeastern train in order to get the last one from their service to get home. We didn't make it and got as far as Tunbridge Wells. This is when things took a turn. We, my family and 2 other people, we're told that we couldn't wait for the first train in the station and had to wait outside. The staff at the station locked it up and went home having ditched 5 customers outside to stay the night on a bench nearby. Not to mention it was a Saturday and kicking out time, with drunken people staggering in the street and shouting antisemitic slurs. After a night on the street in Tunbridge Wells, we learned that a bus replacement service was running so at some time around 6 in the morning, we were finally able to leave and go home. When I raised this point with Southeastern's customer service on Twitter and then directly on their website. they were initially very helpful and issued a refund. They asked that I took a photo of the tickets and I also added the document from Southern Railway giving us permission to travel on the line at no extra cost. I submitted the information to Southeastern that they required and then silence. I contacted them again and again and they never responded and I never got the refund. They have a duty of care to make sure their customers can get home if their train service fails to do so. Yet this one time, we were left on the streets and made to fend for ourselves until the next day.",

I could see a guy who had clearly been drinking and still had a couple of cans with him further up the platform. After a couple of minutes he approached me and I instantly felt a little nervous and vulnerable. He was asking questions about me and trying to give me his phone number. He left after a couple of attempts and me not giving much back. I was almost immediately approached by two members of staff at the station who asked me if I was okay and what the guy had said to me. \nI instantly felt relieved and safe. They were obviously watching and aware of the safety of anyone at the station at this point and acted almost instantly. \nThey checked with me a good few times that I really was okay then they stayed nearby until I was on my train. \nThe kindness almost brought a tear to my eye so I just wanted to say a massive thank you.",

I have found that when something happens like signal fault or someone on the tracks they are quick to resolve the problem and bring service back to normal......I use south south eastern everyday to get to and from work at peak and non peak hours including really early trains and late trains and I rarely have problems with them. Compared to other train networks like great northern and southern that are absolutely shambolic with daily delays, daily issues on the train lines, cancelled trains last minute I actually can\u2019t fault southeastern.  For people complaining about timetables if your a frequent southeastern customer you should know by now they change to summer and autumn time tables and should be checking before you travel train times to avoid issues and give yourself enough time to get to the station and wait! It\u2019s abit of common sense, throughout covid trains were still running at a reasonable service not as frequent As I would like but frequent enough and for people like me that are key workers working throughout covid this was excellent and a life saver, saving me from tubing and getting several busses, I just checked trains before I travel and made sure I knew the train times. I have been travelling on south eastern for around 5 years now and genuinely can not fault the company compared to other appalling ones I\u2019ve experienced.",

As of 7th of September they introduced a new timetable,which they claim would run 98% of pre-COVID trains. This is an absolute lie and they know it. In reality they have cut 50% of rush hour trains from my station (Chelsfield),removed all fast services and left only one direct to Charing Cross. They make us do multiple changes of stations and trains ,exposing us to COVID at a greater rate. \nTheir replies are pointless and you can clearly feel they are just annoyed and want you to disappear. \nObviously there is no alternative and we have to use this horrible company which makes it even more frustrating",

For example, i paid about 25 quid for a return from London to Rochester, the last couple trains were cancelled so we were unable to get home. Had to stay at a friend's house and pay for another ticket the next day so already out of pocket. How much compensation did i get? About 5 pounds.\n\nThey don't care about their passengers and are useless. Needs to be handed back to the government, these private companies are a disgrace to treat the British public this way.",

I went to the train station to question them about who wrote the penalty fare, 8 staff members ganged up on me, all men, and laughed in my face when I asked them about who said that my son looked like he sh**t his pants. They were so rude and intimidating. They were insisting that my children lied to me, which if they were lying my son wouldn't have had that outcome. My children are not liars. It's not about the \u00a320 ticket, the fact that your services gang up on adults let alone vulnerable 12 year old children. For not having the time to buy a train ticket. My son had just started getting better and hadn't had a seizure in 5 months since he was diagnosed. Southeastern services, all you care about is your money, and not the wellbeing of others. You disgust me and you should be ashamed of yourselves. If you are going to give little kids seizures, get medical professionals on your team when giving out penalty fares.",

        "review_text": "Upon asking a 'member of staff' this morning if the train at the platform was the 9:43 to st pancras, I was stunned when I received the answer \"it's going where it's got written on the train mate\" in a ridiculously sarcastic and rude manner, before just walking off. Considering the poor service (late or cancelled trains) that usually run on this service, I always make sure that I check with a member of staff so that I am not late for work. Clearly, this response wasn't exactly helpful and put me in a miserable and annoyed mood all day. To prevent anyone speaking to this sour gentleman again, this was at Ashford International station and he very short and extremely bald. Thanks",

I live in Eltham and for the past 3 years I honestly think I am psychologically scarred by the delays, cancellations and chaos that is South Eastern trains. Excuses upon excuses of why trains are cancelled and the ones you get at the station usually don't match the train conductor's. I used to have a season ticket but now refuse to pay them money in advance, so I use pay as you go on my card - for which there is no option on their website to claim money for delays. Trains are really slow - takes you as long to get into Charing Cross from Eltham as it would to go from Marylebone to Aylesbury (and that's at least 4 times further) Generally I don't think this company cares for its passenger, the board and senior management should resign and just hand over to the TFL in a hope that someone else could maybe manage this disaster of a railway.",

This is ridiculous and something needs to be done about it, but it doesn\u2019t seem like Southeastern even care. \n\nIts frustrating and to make matters worse there are only two train each hour!

        "title": "Pathetic members of staffs & customers service",
        "review_text": "I\u2019ve had a few bad experiences with the members of staff of this company. Sometimes, certain reluctance happens and very rare would let me through at the ticket barrier but some are just downright cynical and pathetic vultures and are terrible people. I am a very understanding person and rarely ever dub anyone as terrible, especially strangers and professions because I wouldn\u2019t know them well enough to judge, but this, I cannot tolerate.\n\nMe and my friends were hanging out in London when we took the train from London Charing Cross. One of my friends asked one of the staffs at the tickets barrier when and why does the ticket barriers sometimes open for people to pass for free, just out of curiosity, he had no intention of fare-dodging. The staff grew rapidly aggressive towards my friend and was \u201cwhat are you talking about? How do you know that? You have to pay for your tickets !\u201d my friend tried explaining again \u2018cause he thought he may not been clear at first but the staff was still aggressive towards him. My friend, who is a very mature and charismatic guy got pretty clicked by that staff\u2019s attitude.\n\nMy second experience was more personal, I was at London Victoria, one hour freaking delay on the train and it was 10pm, so I decided to go to Charing Cross instead. When I got out the train, I remember I have already tapped in and now the barriers are opened so I didn\u2019t know whether I should tap out and if I tap out, would they still take my money away because they did say they will give us compensation. So I decided to ask a member of staff who was just passing by, then this man DELIBERATELY ignored me and kept on walking and talked to his colleagues. Making himself feel like he\u2019s the Queen of England and I\u2019m some moppy beggar peasant. Then he continued standing around and just walking around, clearly having nothing to do while knowing there\u2019re trains that are delaying for over an hour and customers are frustrated. I don\u2019t usually wish poorly on anyone but I hope his socks got wet walking to work the next day.\n\nThirdly, I was hanging out with my little brother in central London, he was 15 at the time so he had a 11-15 oyster card. But then he lost it so he renewed another and was waiting for it to arrive. In the meantime, he would buy a child ticket for \u00a36.30. One day these ticket officers came and checked his ticket, asked him his birthday so he said it but they didn\u2019t believe him. So they asked him for an ID, he didn\u2019t have his passport so he showed them his student ID card. They freaking didn\u2019t accept it and ask for something more valid which he didn\u2019t have so they fined him \u00a320 fare. For a god damn kid !\n\nFinally, just recently actually. I have to get up early every Monday and Friday for college in central and I would go to Clock House Station and get to either Charing Cross or Cannon Street. Then one morning, as usual, I got to Clock House, perfectly timed to top up my oyster card and get down to my platform but then this day, the ticket machine didn\u2019t accept credit cards and I didn\u2019t have any cash on me, the nearest cash machine is 2 minutes walk away but then I would definitely miss my train. The ticket office wasn\u2019t even working as well. So I just hopped on my train and hoping I can explain to the ticket officers and pay for cheapest ticket fares there. But when I got there. First off, the man at the barrier was incredibly mean and sarcastic \u201cLook, we don\u2019t know ok? Go ask the ticket office\u201d, I could see it in his smirks. Then I asked the ticket office, two ticket officers came to me, I explained what happened, THEY DIDN\u2019T BELIEVE ME and tried making any teeny-tiny loopholes to circumvent my argument such as \u201coh but then you should\u2019ve planned and come to the station much earlier\u201d, I thought that was stupid because it doesn\u2019t matter how late or early I came to the station, the ticket machine or office was working so what difference would it make? I had zero intention of fare-dodging and I was prepare to pay for a travel card or whatever but they made me pay a \u00a320 penalty fare. To make it worse, they mistaken me for a woman, I thought it was a joke at first but then realized they were serious. I was incredibly upset with the energies I received from these people, I couldn\u2019t make it to my college anyway because it was late so I decided to just head back home. \n\nI was sitting on the train trying to hold my tears, not because I got a penalty fare but I\u2019m overwhelmed of how low-cunning, rude and unsympathetic some people are. I\u2019m pretty understanding of people, I have family members who specializes in the services industry so I get a lot of insights and respects for the enterprise, then seeing how poorly these employees behave, it\u2019s disappointing and sad how some of them are getting paid for being vultures. I get that the law should be strict and all, I get these people need to collect silvers from us for wages but damn it, some of these things are not even that serious but their attitudes surely drove me, and many others I assume, to the wall.",

        "review_text": "Seeing as this company does not seem to reply to complaints I'll post mine here.\n\nThis complaint is regarding the treatment I received from a member of staff on the 4th of April at London Victoria station. \n\nI do not know this member of staff's name, but the authorised collector's number is E10057.\n\nI travelled up from Maidstone east, I did get to the station in time to use the ticket machine however I rarely travel by train and so I wasn't sure what ticket was valid for which journeys; I also needed the correct receipt for my travel to claim it back from work. In short, the machine was not helpful or informative enough for me to purchase from it. There were no staff present so I was unable to purchase my ticket. I walked straight to the ticket desk at Victoria to purchase my fare, plus the additional tickets I needed for the rest of my journey. \n\nAs I approached the desk there was a member of staff dealing with another female passenger in an overly aggressive manner. This put me somewhat on edge and to be honest I did not want him to ask him anything. But he was the only member of staff I had found up to this point. \n\nSo I said I needed a return fare from Maidstone east, and I also wanted a travel card for the underground, and I also wanted an itemised receipt so I could claim it back off work. \n\nThis is the point where I began to feel very intimidated. He informed me that he was from the 'revenue office' and as I didn't have a ticket at this point he was going to have to give me a penalty fare. This man did not listen to a word I said. I was not fare dodging, I had no reason to fare dodge. My employer was paying my travel expenses, I made it very clear that I wanted to purchase a by-no-means cheap travel ticket from him. \nI had to pay for the fine on the spot. Which I have discovered in your terms and conditions I should have been offered the option to pay within the week. I had to pay on my credit card because I couldn't afford it. I specifically told this member of staff. \nIs it common practise to train your staff to ignore what the customer is saying to them, to belittle them, to bully them and show no human decency whatsoever? \n\nThis man was a common, sexist, bully. How is it my fault that you do not have any staff to help at the station? \n\nWhat's more I do not have any way of claiming my travel back from work. I have had to pay the full amount. I cannot afford that. So now I am out of pocket as well. \n\nI would also like to state that this member of staff commented that I looked confused and said I clearly don't use the trains very often. So he had a good laugh at my expense too. Silly girl who doesn't know how the trains work. \n\nWhat happened basic decent customer service? \n\nI was an easy, vulnerable and ideal target for this kind of intimidation for you to make a few extra easy bucks. And I am outraged. \nAnd no one has responded to my emails regarding this",

It is a rip off.You cannot buy a weekly ticket in advance to avoid long ques. If you put in a claim for compensation you never get a response or ack. Please nationalise this service and bring in staff that care about customers who will clean the trains and w.c. and make sure they are working. Early in the mornig you want to sleep and you are woken up for ticket checks. They are quick to fine you but not quick to open up their shutters when you come home from work to buy a ticket.

        "review_text": "Normally, their train service is acceptable, expensive, fairly comfortable, even the toilets work (sometimes).  The staff are usually really good, if a bit exasperated (they do not complain, it is just they are often dealing with tricky circumstances); although, sad to say, one guard prompted a complaint for her dictatorial behaviour (guarding an empty First Class on an  overloaded train, the company seems to have changed policies since).  During the recent snow, I am afraid that they failed to provide security and nearly emptied out a train because the horn stopped working, but after 5 minutes of 250 passengers standing puzzled in the snow, they let them reboard and went at 20mph, which was the right thing to do.  Generally, the service is okay.  Sometimes, trains get delayed due to staff not getting to Victoria, there are too many delays but it is the exception rather than the rule.  Looking forward to continued expected improvement.",

        "review_text": "To start with the positives:\r\n- Finally removed all of the old 'slam shut' trains and have increased the quality/maintenance of those in operation.\r\n\r\nHowever...negatives:\r\n- Frequently late.\r\n- Prices increase out of kilter with the level of service improvements made.\r\n- Ability to respond when trains are late, systems fail etc is poor, both on their app (which is hit an miss) and in terms of informed staff at stations.\r\n-Processing a 'late train' claim takes in excess of 10 days, to which their usual response is that 'our system says otherwise' - usually the same system that was incorrectly reporting at the time. There is no email or number to then complain upon from their automated response - the only way to question their response is to WRITE in.\r\n\r\nTerrible company, service and satisfaction levels are clearly unimportant and their available communication mediums are worse than those expected from companies stuck in 1990.",
