A decent company would reimburse me for my additional loss, not just offer a refund. Will never use Lumo again. It's amazing how in most countries I've been to the trains just work and are on time.

Similarly recent delays are mainly down to some single line working north of Newcastle due to a structural fault on a bridge.\n\nLumo is certainly the cheap option and the seats are apparently slightly more spacious than LNER Standard. However you do feel crammed in with very little luggage space. My seat had no window. Staff were cheerful but not a great way to spend 4.5 hours or enjoy one of the more picturesque European railway journeys.",

        "review_text": "Train cancellation without warning due to derailment in Edinburgh. Told to get on another train line which we did, Lumo staff from derailment train on same coach, they had a lovely time sitting down enjoying their time not advising displaced Lumo travellers what to do which station to get off at or providing Customer service disgraceful. We were left on a train without a valid ticket, told to get off at York station  and wait to hours for the next train. Had reserved seats for months however when we got on the train on seats available  from York to Kings Cross station. To say I am angry is a understatement. If I could give Lumo transport less than a one I would. \nLumo is a disgrace.",

They may pride themselves on low fares but when that comes at the cost of overcrowded trains spilling over with luggage (dangerously piled high in the vestibules and falling off racks) they need to rethink. Inevitably, not a single member of staff was seen around to deal with any of the mayhem. May well go to the press with some pictures of their dangerous service. Total shambles, will never use again and will strongly recommend to friends and family to avoid. I see there are many other similar poor reviews on here and can only suspect the positive ones are written by staff, they sound like they are!",

It was a very very difficult time as there was lots of delays as the train effectively crawled it\u2019s way to Edinburgh (it took 10 hours roughly) the staff were an absolute credit to any company. I saw them deal with frankly outrageous customers who clearly thought lumo could control the weather with grace and good humour and despite the challenging circumstances remained positive and helpful. I had contact with gary, gary, frosty and Lindsay and would like to make sure they receive the praise they are due for all their hard work yesterday. They made a long day more tolerable and I will definitely use lumo again",

It didn\u2019t affect me but did other passengers - first I had heard if it was when there was an announcement AFTER the train had departed - very clever!!\n\nSeats we had booked in the quiet coach were not honoured in either of our journeys. And a buffet that does not serve hot food during freezing temperatures is unacceptable. I also think that the heating was shut off about 40 minutes prior to the end of the journey as suddenly the train got very cold.\n\nNever again!",

I could not keep my legs in a healthy position.\nI am taller than an average brit but not super tall. \nAll this space optimisation focusing only one one criteria (money) leads to forgetting about basic comfort levels.\nIt is discrimination to optimise for the most average and ignore minority.\nThis will be legal case at some point which hopefully will stop the eyefolded space optimisation that forgets about the fact that the service is for people with access to human rights.\nAh - forgot to mention - one staff member serve probably  500-1000 people.

Staff who showed passengers to seats and stored luggage for them, driver who introduced himself by name, and gave updates on the journey. No overcrowding as they only let people board with pre booked seats. Once there was a delay en route, but the train caught up and we arrived on time. Smooth comfortable warm and speedy journey. Trolley service (like on a plane) was fine... though most people brought their own food. Best of all, non-stop to Newcastle, and then a few more minutes to arrive at our beautiful Morpeth station. I seriously wonder if all the poor reviews are genuine, seeing how the service is in competition with the major provider on the route!",

I take one big bag and it is never a problem \nThey are always on time, non stop Newcastle London and don\u2019t go on strike.\nThe staff have got to know me and chat to me each journey.\nI think calling them the Ryanair of the railways is a compliment!!!!!\n\nIf you want first class service and all the trimmings then pay the vast price on another network. You still wouldn\u2019t get the cheerful staff though on another service.\nI hope they stay around forever.\nI\u2019ve never come across any staff member less than cheerful and helpful.\nI\u2019ll always use them",

From now on I\u2019ll book with Lumo. Just in case the other operators decide to strike a few days before. They\u2019re a great company with a simple ethos.\n\nFinally, for those complaining about luggage. It\u2019s clear as day when you book on their website what their luggage policy is. If Trainline are not showing it; that\u2019s their issue. Lumo can only offer cheaper tickets if it maintains certain criteria. (Imagine booking Ryanair and expecting the luggage allowance of Emirates). Check it before you travel, and you\u2019ll have a drama free journey.'\n\n\nThese reviews are so clearly put on by LUMO to justify their incompetence. This operator would struggle to run a bath, never mind a rail company. How about improving your service to boost your rating rather than posting fake reviews?\n\nIts well worth checking their equally bad reviews on Facebook!",

The train itself was fine, not as pleasant as an LNER or similar long-distance service, but passable enough. \n\nMy main complaints are twofold- firstly, that the refreshments trolley does not sell any sandwiches or hot food, meaning passengers must bring this with them. Secondly, the luggage policy and storage arrangements are ridiculous. I have long thought that there is not enough luggage space on British trains and Lumo have somehow managed to worsen this. This is just not acceptable for a train operating company- the public should be encouraged to use rail travel over air travel, and part of that includes not having restrictions on what passengers can bring. Several reviewers here have said they would rather fly to Edinburgh next time, which is concerning given the amount of emissions generated for such a short journey by air when compared to the rail journey. It is particularly sad given that Lumo make much of their trains being electric. \n\nLumo: rethink your luggage policy urgently. If you are driving passengers back to the airlines, then being fully electric is naught but greenwashing. Oh and please add sandwiches to your catering carts, thanks.",

There was plenty of leg room, everyone could get their bags stowed either overhead or in the compartments at each end of the carriages. Chairs had individual lighting, a pull out table and wing head rests. The chairs were tall which meant you did not feel you were in a crowded space. The journey was very smooth, very quick and quiet. The inside of the train was clean and nothing looked torn or tatty.\n\nStaff were very friendly and the announcements were very clear over the tannoy without being bombarded every few minutes like on some operators.\n\nOn board food and snacks are limited but there's plenty of choice in the station to stock up on before hand. \n\nWifi was pretty useless, I could not load anything despite my device saying it was connected but that feels like a first world problem.\n\nOverall I would definitely travel Lumo again, and actually preferred it compared to the other operator's service we used.",

Weirdly I got a email from Lumo stating that if I was one of the unlucky customers to have their journeys cancelled this was an IT issue. They highlight it was not my fault but will not refund the cost.",

The dates on your website for a refund only go till the end of December 22 so not even possible to request a refund.

The staff saw my ticket and told me to 'get in the train' intitially and then denied it and insisted that i had to buy tickets.

        "review_text": "My train from Edinburgh to London was cancelled completely (due to a broken windscreen wiper). It was the last train that day (at 5:55pm). Lumo staff kept us waiting for 1 hour on the platform before telling us what was happening and what our options were (causing customers going to Newcastle to miss an alternative train). I had to stay in Edinburgh for an extra night and travel the following day. I have tried to claim my train ticket cost back via their website (which is a pain becuase the automation does not work and you have to type everything in) and received a reply saying that their is evidence that my ticket was used for travel so my claim is not valid. I used the ticket for travel on a Lumo train the following day, as advised - i.e. a delay of more than 16 hours. I am now having to waste time appealing the decision - this is appalling. \nWe were also told by Lumo staff at the station that we would be able to apply for compensation for costs incurred by staying in Edinburgh an extra day - in my case bus tickets to and from the station and a meal (I did not need a hotel as I was staying with a relative). But they are refusing to honour that because they say I have to have receipts, and the bus does not give receipts as it is contactless, and they will not accept a bank statement as it is not \"itemised\", even though it says Edinburgh buses for the correct time and could not be anything else.\nIf I could give them -10 I would.\n\nUPDATE: when I complained to Lumo, they said I had used the wrong form on their website to apply for a refund, apparently \"delay repay\" is if you have used the ticket and \"refund for delayed train\" is if you haven't used the ticket, but this is as clear as mud. I got the refund in the end, having wasted time. They also eventually agreed to accept my bank statement instead of a receipt for the bus tickets (which don't exist, of course, as the bus payments are now contactless) for the wasted journey to the station. So I'm giving them an extra star.\nI forgot to say that the wifi was also useless, they make you give all your personal details to create an account to get it, and then it can only be used for a very limited number of websites and activities, very slowly!",

The return journey left Edinburgh on time and arrived at Kings Cross on time.\nIt is advisable to abide by the company\u2019s luggage restrictions of one bag that can be stored in the overhead luggage rack and one smaller bag that can be accommodated under the seat or on lap. This is relevant because of the popularity of the service meaning that most, if not all, seats are occupied. I wish other train operating companies were as rigorous. All of the staff that I encountered were friendly and visible. The food available is basic so I would advise passengers to either eat before their journey or purchase sandwiches, etc. from elsewhere beforehand. The seats were a little on the stiff side but were in a comfortable sitting position. I am 6\u20197\u201d tall and there was adequate leg room for me even with a camera back stored under my legs.

We arrived early to secure a place for a large bag which, because of its contents and the warnings about thefts from luggage on these trains, we wanted to keep under direct observation throughout our journey from Kings X to Newcastle. 3 late arrivals and their very smelly dog rocked up later and then started to rearrange everyone else's bags to suit their requirements. When we refused to move our bag the train staff, who said when asked said her name was Jane (but she held her ID card so that you couldn't check), then joined them in mocking our refusal to comply with a smug grin. She then went on to say that if we had a problem it wasn't her problem as \"she hadn't designed the train\". so much for customer service. As a partly disabled pensioner I would have expected better.

        "review_text": "Having read numerous poor reviews I was very nervous to be travelling to Edinburgh and back on Lumo for a short break with my two children. I didn\u2019t need to worry, the trains were on time both ways and faultless. I had pre-contacted Lumo to enquire about changing our seats to ones around a table and this was sorted, they were reserved for us both ways. The train was clean, comfy and despite being full with Easter travellers, everyone was very quiet and content. The snack trolley came up and down a few times during the four hours and the staff were regularly through checking on everyone. Toilets were fine, obviously not amazing condition by the end of a long journey used by lots of people but I\u2019ve seen far worse! The only slight negative is the Wi-Fi was very poor (non existent!) along with their own entertainment they promote, very little choice.. 8 films and two were Xmas ones in April! Music only classical etc. so pre-download things and have plenty of data! As long as you read the rules on luggage, the fact there\u2019s no meals, no first class, not changing date etc. then I think you will be just fine. If there\u2019s delays due to rail faults then this would happen on any service, I would definitely use Lumo again!",

        "review_text": "Excellent service. Nice trains, nice seat, nice temperature, on time departure: everything you want from an operator. \n\nCrew on board were great too. I\u2019m on the 1st Sept service from Edinburgh to London. Due to the strikes, my LNER train ticket got cancelled at the last minute. The next available service where my ticket could be used was well into the following day. But I need to be in London from Saturday morning. Luckily Lumo were there, picking up those left helpless by the last minute strikes. And offering an impeccable service.\n\nTwo points to note here:\n\nI\u2019m all for strikes\u2026 But with advance notice. Calling a strike a week in advance (when these tickets were booked 2 months in advance) is unacceptable.\n\nShort notice strikes will only lead people away from your company, or to use last minute alternative options if they exist.\n\nMoral of the story. From now on I\u2019ll book with Lumo. Just in case the other operators decide to strike a few days before. They\u2019re a great company with a simple ethos.\n\nFinally, for those complaining about luggage. It\u2019s clear as day when you book on their website what their luggage policy is. If Trainline are not showing it; that\u2019s their issue. Lumo can only offer cheaper tickets if it maintains certain criteria. (Imagine booking Ryanair and expecting the luggage allowance of Emirates). Check it before you travel, and you\u2019ll have a drama free journey.",

Another member of staff was friendly and tried to help, however she was flustered in the process as well. \n\nSurely if a service has that little space between then lumo should provide luggage only carriage for their customers. Even just for customers heading to Edinburgh, therefore other customers could use the luggage racks provided. \n\nIf traveling with a brief case, or rucksack great choice, with have luggage I would recommend paying for LNER OR GRAND CENTRAL.",

I have never in my life been told i can't take my golf clubs on a train (i am 51 years old) and that includes several journeys on Lumo! I had no other baggage of any significance and the train was not full. The train assistant showed me some t&c's on her mobile where it mentioned no sporting equipment BUT later when i checked my ticket there were NO t&c's mentioning items not allowed. I bought my ticket through Trainline (a popular 3rd party booking app) and there was nothing, both during the buying process (i did a test buying the ticket again to re-assure myself i hadn't missed it the first time) and after looking at my purchased ticket. My missed train has cost me a lot both financially, including having to booking another expensive train, and also missing an important appointment. Surely this can't be right, a company cannot sell a ticket to the consumer without making sure the essential info is CLEARLY stated, especially if they allow a 3rd party app to sell their tickets...there was no statement about prohibited golf clubs  AT ALL!!!\n\nI also saw them bullying some young Asian travellers with normal sized suit cases...a very bad look...shame on Lumo!",

I said i had an issue with how she said this to me there are a lot of other people on the platform why hasn't she gone and spoke with them.. Shes embarrassed me in front of strangers.. She already gave me a dirty look coming over the bridge and said to her colleague travelling light... Which is completely unprofessional.her colleague piped up saying thats unfair i said where you there but your other colleague was who isn't saying anything so why is she interfering . Is it because im a coloured women so she thought she would approach me and leave the white folk untold... 3 of them telling me there company policy..saying they are trying to make everyone aware.. Saw them talking to no one else nor making any announcements on the train to reiterate this this policy  is not clearly shown at any time you are purchasing the ticket bet its in the small print.. \n\nWill never travel with this company again...\nShocking and disgusting racist behaviour by the staff..",

The cost of the first ticket totalled 124 and rebooking caused me 192 and not to mention the inconvenience of carrying all my luggage to and back from the station (including hours of waiting before they cancelled). Trainline refunded me for the 124 and asked me to contact Lumo for the additional cost I had to incur on the journey. They have been rejecting my claims for idk what reason as they do not even allocate an actual customer services personnel for each case, this has been a hard one for me as I plan my journeys in advance in order to avoid unnecessary costs.

        "review_text": "So just to defend Lumo from some previous poor reviews...\n\n1. If you book a Lumo only Anytime ticket, you should really check your ticket before you board, don't get how that's the train operators fault. In the same way you can book an Anytime LNER/GC ticket and get on the wrong train. It's your responsibility to buy the right ticket.\n2. It's not 'racism' to book through ScotRail and not hear all the details. It's common knowledge that if you book a train directly with the operator you get more info about your journey.\n\nFor myself, every time I have travelled Lumo I have found it a comfortable and efficient service. You are paying for a low cost operator, so you should expect a low thrills experience however I believe Lumo is better than that. For instance, the ability to connect to Wi-Fi and watch films on your phone/tablet while travelling is a godsend in my opinion, especially if you're like me and forget to download things to watch before travelling!\n\nI find the Lumo trains to be a lot more comfortable than the Azumas that LNER offer and with the slight recline that Lumo have compared to the upright ironing board seats that LNER have, I genuinely feel comfortable on Lumo's trains.\n\nOne thing I would advise though, if you don't like busy trains, Lumo aren't for you. Their services are always busy but I myself have never felt cramped on them. \n\nThankfully I've never experience delays with Lumo (touch wood) so have yet to experience their out of train customer service however their onboard customer service is superb! Always friendly and polite!",

        "review_text": "We have travelled with this company before and it has been okay. However on our return journey from Edinburgh to London the train was delayed for 74 minutes. This was partly due to their muddle in Edinburgh, failing to get the water topped up and partly due to a broken down train the line, which was not their fault. There is an entitlement to 100% refund if delays arriver an hour. We tried to reclaim for two tickets through their website. They appeared to be unable to understand that we had two tickets and disallowed one claim, saying that we had claimed twice for the same ticket. We appealed this and resent the photograph of the disputed ticket. We have not heard back yet. They also said that they could not refund money to our account and have to send a cheque for the claim they did allow...no idea why....\nUPDATE\nEventually refunds for both tickets were agreed. We were told that they could not credit our account and would send a cheque. Email received saying a cheque would be send on 7/9/22 and it would take 10-15 days. It hasn't arrived. We were told the second ticket refund had been approved but have not had a refund. Just complained. Maybe they are just trying to avoid payment....",

The Lumo website said revised schedules for Sunday 6th November would be available by 31st October.  On 5th November the Lumo website still says 31st October.  Due to reduced service any Lumo trains running were mandatory reservations only, but after trying for 2 days to make a seat reservation via their Twitter team I'm not told that the Lumo system is down.  Rubbish communication!\n\nThe catering/trolley service never reached Coach A in the 3 hours from London to Newcastle.\n\nThe website says Lumo is \"A new train service helping you to travel well, beyond expectations\".  Not sure if Lumo was intended to be a challenger or disrupter rail service but it doesn't appear to be anything different compared with any other train operator in the UK, actually probably worse than most, including Avanti West Coast.  The Marketing department at Lumo who're pushing the \"We're different!!!\" message really need to speak with the people who are actually running train services, as the marketing message is far from what's happening in reality.",

What the hell is this service?  Both my girlfriend and I were unaware of their so called policy what passengers can take or not?  I did not expect to hear of other comments about passengers being told to leave their belongings at the platform!!!  We were very disappointed with Lumo and the way we were treated?  However, we got the impression that the service was behaving similar to airline services charging passengers extra due to size?  I was threatened with a \u00a330 charge, but somehow I was able to put my luggage on a chair where there was no window to view the scenery.  This was in order to getting my case out of the way so passengers could move along.  My girlfriend was sitting where there was no window and kept her case next to where she was seated.  Having saying that and knowing how chaotic it was to finding a luggage space to putting our cases, we came to a conclusion that where there were no windows to view we expect that there might have been luggage spaces and that they might have been removed and inserted new passenger seats to make more room?  I am claustrophobic and did not expect to be sitting next to a wall where I cannot see?  Both of us felt closed in and it was like being put into a wall cupboard.  We put this to Lumo that it was unsatisfactory, bad attitudes from staff and that we will not be travelling with this service again!!!!",

They should let LNER take over the franchise as the 12.50pm Lumo train from Newcastle was delayed and then cancelled due to an on going fault And LNER have a lot more consistently well run trains. I thought Lumo trains were fairly new trains?!? \n\nI\u2019m now writing this on a very busy, standing room only LNER train and Lumo have lofty ambitions but nil points from me in terms of service and customer satisfaction. The only reason Lumo trains is getting one star is that the train from London to Newcastle was pretty smooth.\n\nI think it\u2019s when trains coming from the north going south they\u2019re not very good at. \n\nIf you travel with these muppets be warned of last second cancellations and delays. Thankfully, I bought my ticket through LNER so will get my delay repay soon enough, instead of jumping through hoops and getting the rail ombudsman involved in my first dispute.\n\nWhat a bunch of jokers.\n\nUpdate: 10th January 2023\n\nTo Lumo\u2019s credit I will be receiving a delay repay for the original ticket I purchased and as I put in another claim for the LNER ticket I bought and put it in as a delay repay too, Lumo will also be compensating me for that ticket too. Unexpected but better than the first time. Upped it by a couple of stars that they approved and compensated for the time and expense. I just hope they can sort out their trains to be better.

        "review_text": "The staff were all very friendly and helpful BUT everything else about the train was below par.  The seats are incredibly cramped, I couldn't even begin to think about using my laptop to work because there simply wasn't the space within the seat to type.  If I had been sitting next to anybody but my husband or a family member it would have been truly awkward as the seats are so close together, far worse than a Ryanair plane!  There was only the option to purchase drinks for a short period of time by going to the top of each carriage, rendered almost impossible due to the cramped conditions and people squeezed into the spaces.  There are constant announcements made in a very officious manner about no luggage to be left out anywhere, the order to remain in your own allocated seat, the requirement to take your own litter away with you etc..  and yet there is hardly anywhere to put luggage.  You are instructed to put smaller bags under the seats but with them being so close together there isn't room for a bag and your feet, I spent the entire 4.5 hour journey twisted into the window (I am 5'10 and my husband is 6'2, we are tall but hardly giants!)  We had purposely booked seats with electric sockets next to them but when we sat down these turned out to just be stickers of sockets, not real sockets - what's the point?   Finally, the air conditioning wasn't working and it was an extremely hot day, we were all extremely grateful to get off in London.  I had heard rumours that Lumo is the worst train service to London from Edinburgh, we usually use Virgin or Avanti, but I thought they were just that, rumours.  Sadly they turned out to be true and we shall most certainly never be travelling by Lumo again.",

        "review_text": "LUMO! Welcome to the Ryanair of train travel (minus the low fares) complete with sullen, untrained, combative onboard staff. Also, daft, unclear baggage policies, and zero understanding/professionalism in dealing with the public/customers, definitely not those with, even really well behaved dogs! I travelled from London to Newcastle today, and, tsk, hadn't read the terms and conditions of LUMO's luggage policy (one item pp, any extra costs \u00a330 per item. A tad miffed as I was, I asked the staff member (Lindsay) to please give me an invoice, but that I wasn't happy, and it wasn't clear. Lindsay didn't like me not being happy about this, and her response was berate me, insisting on the last word, for not reading the terms and conditions. I had my (luckily very gentle, calm) collie dog with me, who I could see was looking anxious that I was upset. I wanted to de-escalate the situation so I could sit down and relax. No chance. Along comes LUMO's second finest crew member, Ben, who tells me to 'stop or I'll have you removed'. Pile-on time. Things eventually calmed down and I began to compose my customer complaint. Dog is bit worried, but then relaxes and lies down in the aisle. Along comes drinks trolley propelled by LUMO's finest, Lindsay and Ben. Before I've had a chance to move my dog Lindsay, true to form, loudly announces 'MOVE YOUR DOG OUT OF THE AISLE'. Dog is scared, refuses to move towards shouty woman and trolley who are right at my seat. I ask them please to move drinks trolley back a bit so I can get dog into my seat (he will come if they back off even a couple of feet). They refuse. Ben announces that if I don't move my dog, he will have no option but to 'call the police'. LUMO's finest sure know how to escalate a situation from zero to 1000 in 2 minutes. Dog ain't moving, he's too spooked. I advise Lindsay that she should probably get some training in dogs on trains and she's lucky he's not, as some dogs would be, barking at her or trying to defend me. Lindsay announces that if my dog was aggressive she'd have it 'put to sleep'. My jaw actually hits the floor at this stage. I pick up the dog from the aisle floor (he's large and this isn't easy) and the trolley sails past us. Thanks LUMO for a truly unforgettable train experience!! I've lodged my complaint for unclear luggage policies and unbelievably rude staff. I can see that customer care training isn't a LUMO priority anyway. I would rather walk to London than ever use this company again, no amount of therapy (for me, or the dog) would ever be enough to be able to cope with such shoddy treatment. God I miss British Rail.",

        "title": "DO NOT TRAVEL WITH FAMILY",
        "review_text": "Extremely poor service with zero consideration for families/babies/children. We were travelling in the evening with our 3 kids under 5, a buggy and bags from Kings X to Edinburgh. Been on this train many times before, always told to sit in the \u201cdisabled\u201d area as this is the only area on the train with space for a buggy. We had booked extra seats for our children to sit in - even though they should technically be free. Paid for seats as have known them to be very full, didn\u2019t want to take any chances. We were moved from the disabled area under the pretense that an \u201cautistic girl\u201d needed the seats. Okay, no problem, moved seats. The \u201cautistic girl\u201d that got on was actually a 22 year old woman who was perfectly functional, had totally normal conversation with variety of passengers, travelled with her mother- and seemed to just want the extra space to stretch her legs as she sat on her phone happily. From my experience as a doctor I could safely diagnose she was certainly not autistic to the point of needing this space. \nThen suddenly after 3 hours on this train (it\u2019s now nearly 11pm!!), one of our children asleep in the buggy, the train staff start saying this woman must now move as a wheelchair user needs the space. And I must take my child out of the buggy as it is against their policy to have buggies on the train. I asked what he suggests travelling families do with their buggies. He says if it can be folded small it is allowed on otherwise he suggests not to take the train. RIDICULOUS. I explained this was ludicrous, the train is full, it\u2019s 11PM, I have a sleeping toddler in the buggy, another one asleep on our two seats and our baby asleep on the othet two. He told me I should have purchased more child seats if I needed a space. Menawhile this \u201cautistic girl\u201d occupied 3 seats having only purchased one adult seat. When I pointed this out all he said was \u201cwell find a free seat then\u201d. Unbelievable. Even other passengers on the train were coming to support as the interaction was so ludicrous. \nThe icing on the cake was that the supposed wheelchair user that joined wasn\u2019t in a wheelchair at all!! Just an older gentleman (in his 60s) and his son with a ton of shopping bags and two suit bags!! Couldn\u2019t believe it. \nTo top it off there were two drug addicts who joined as well and insisted on sitting in the carriage claiming they were children (no teeth, no hair, marks all over their arms, smelling of weed and alcohol). The train staff let them sit next to another young family. Laughing about how comical it was. They only asked them to pay for one child seat in the end. \n\nAll whilst I was told to purchase more child seats next time if I wanted my children to be able to sit on the train. Which we had done. Never again. \n\nNo consideration for families at all. Just snide comments and poor staff with appalling communication.",

        "review_text": "The service was OK, it was on time and the staff were helpful and all, but this has to be the most uncomfortable seating I've ever experienced on public transport. \n\nAnd I've flown Ryan Air...\n\nIt feels very much like the designers of these carriages set out with a truly machiavellian intent to either cause my posture to resemble that of a road-killed squirrel, or just to cause me irreparable damage on a cellular level.\n\nQuite how one can graduate in seating design, then apparently not only forget every single aspect of it, but intentionally design seating that causes nothing but excruciating pain and discomfort for the entire 5 hour journey, is actually truly an accomplishment. \n\nThe crowning design feature is the tray table, which has the charming habit of smacking down from the upright position directly onto your knees/coffee/now heavily-inflamed groinal area, every time the train goes over a bump bigger than a leaf. And given that the suspension installed was apparently from a 14th Century horse and cart, this happens rather often.\n\nThe seats also have the quite wonderful 'closeness' that is becoming unfortunately more common, as each low-budget travel company tries to squeeze just one more, now hideously deformed passenger, onto every journey. \n\nAt precisely 4cm too close to each other, the inspiration appears to have been the 'Little Ease' torture chamber in the Tower of London, a room that was shaped so the occupant could neither stand, kneel, nor sit. \n\nThe task of relaxing becomes like some twisted hybrid of tetris and buckaroo, as you toss in your tiny alloted space, attempting to not have some part of the compartment make sweet, sweet love to a part of your body that really shouldn't be treated that way.\n\nAll in all, I think Lumo as a company shouldn't really be blamed in a sense, but I would advise anyone against travelling on one of these trains, unless you fancy shelling out for 6 months of chiropracty and/or major spinal surgery.\n\nThere WAS, however, hot water in the toilet. So when they use the jaws of life to extract my limp, crippled corpse from my seat in Edinburgh, at least my mutilated hands will be clean.",

She refused - telling me to stand back. I looked at the time and it was still not time for the train to leave so I could not believe it and begged her to let me on and she did not. The train then left 1 minute earlier than it was scheduled to. I filed a complaint and was told I would not be compensated as trains normally don't let people on 1-2 minutes before - despite this \"rule\" not being advertised anywhere.

Lumo are following the flow by only accepting plastic for payment ggrrrrrrr. I feel this should be communicated to the passengers every time there is an announcement regarding the buffet bar. The seating is hard on the backside. After 2 hrs it was as if I had ants in my pants. The good points are that the train was clean. the staff helpfull and the train was early on arrival in Kings X. I would agree with others that there is not the greatest of space for large luggage cases, 20 - 26K size. Would I travel again with Lumo?  Yes. The buffet car complaints/ take my own drinks and food, after all it is only a 4-1\\2 hr trip. The only thing I cannot change is the hard seating.",

Who on earth decided to fit the tables so low??? They aren't as low on LNER (same trains). What an own goal Lumo! So I can't actually travel with Lumo again because its too uncomfortable sitting with both my knees out to one side to enable me to put my coffee on the table. \n2) Toilets looked clean, smelt disgusting! \n3) Not enough luggage space. Clearly prioritising bums on seats over the amount of resulting luggage space required for that number of passengers. \n4) Refreshment trolley only came through twice. Second time there were no hot drinks.\n5) Train was dirty when we got on. Food debris on our pull down tables, on seats and floor. Doesn't anyone clean them between trips? Doesn't take long to run through with a small hoover. \nShocking. I'm staying with LNER (price was about the same).",

We travelled 20 miles to Waverley station - only to be told we had to drive to Newcastle !!  There was no LUMO train from Newcastle when we got there so had to purchase LNER tickets for our onward journey. LUMO refuse to compensate us in any way - either for the more expensive tickets we had to purchase - or pay for petrol for 300 miles journey.  Absolutely shocking company - which I will never use again.   The proof of a good company is their communication and how they treat passengers when things go wrong - LUMO have failed in both respects with this.",

I used to want to be near the luggage rack because every stop I would be anxious about my suitcase and go check on it but the limited stops on lumo are a dream, straight upto Newcastle! Fantastic. \nThere are a few bad reviews for this service but I think it\u2019s brilliant. There is limited luggage space on the carriages which is noted on their website (one medium case per passenger I believe) and it does cause issues. With that said the staff have always been so fantastic and always willing to help reassemble the luggage for a better use of space and like I mentioned there are so few stops that you can sit and feel assured your case won\u2019t be going anywhere.\nBack to the staff, they have all been so lovely I can\u2019t stress this enough! I actually missed my train once due to the tube strikes in London and they let me on the next train without any issues. I was ready to put up a fight or get my negotiating face on for the fare difference (I had book far in advance and got a cheap ticket) and I was blown away with their amazing attitude. I really want this company to thrive and not just because they are a Northern company but because they deserve it \ud83d\ude0a\nThank you to everyone at Lumo, keep it up!",

Easily the cheapest fares on the route. \n\nThe train arrived on time from Kings Cross and indeed all parts of both journeys ran to time. Despite being busy, the train was clean and on the 90 minute journey to Edinburgh rubbish was collected by a member of staff and a drinks trolley served people at their seats.  The train itself is brand new and there is plenty of room between the seats which are better padded and more comfortable than those operated by LNER and Trans Pennine Express. \n\nStaff were particularly helpful with the driver keeping us updated on progress and the guard/ticket inspector very helpful with a query I had on connections at Edinburgh. She went the extra mile.\n\nWill certainly use the service again.",

There is little difference between LNER Standard and Lumo ie adequate if a little Spartan. The train was heavily reserved but there were a significant number of \u2018no shows\u2019 which allowed me to move to one of the rare tables for 4. Even with c.50% occupancy it was clear that luggage storage was inadequate with seats being used for larger items. The trolley had a basic offering with just instant coffee. It is not possible to pre order food on this early departure and the trolley does not have any fresh food such as sandwiches. Staff were pleasant and professional. Fine for the most cost conscious but not the best way to enjoy one of the country\u2019s great train journeys.",

Contacted customer services who replied twice writing absolutely useless things, suggesting that I rebook. I was so desperate that I even tried that, but the website didn't work. I wrote again to customer services who from this point on simply ignored me. There I was with a large sum paid, no ticket, no email reply, no chat, no telephone number, nothing whatsoever. Finally the very friendly staff at Kings Cross ticket office helped by printing my ticket using the reservation reference. They also said that Lumo is rubbish, which it absolutely is! Incredible, they just take your money and ignore you! Appalling customer services, will never use them ever again! Absolutely NOT recommended.",

Got to Newcastle station early, just to make sure if it was cancelled (like many have said) I could sort it out.. had a chat with a train guard who said everything was ok... We got on to a heaving train, but to much suprise, my luggage was able to go above us (many said there is no space) and the seats were perfect, the only bother was that not Lumos fault or any other Trainline, there was issues with over head line issues in-between York and Doncaster.. it did make us 22mins late but, we were informed of latest information as soon as the train staff were told.. have to say it was an amazing journey and the return, no problems at all.. have to say don't read too much into the poor reviews...",

Was told we\u2019d be transferred by coach. Everyone was given water. Staff very very pleasant and kept us updated that it was difficult to get coaches as it was school pick up time. 2 hours later, no coach. Taxis at our disposal to take us onto our journey. 2.1/2 hours later we arrived at Edinburgh. Thank you lumo you could not control the lorry on the track.

It is so cramped your practically sitting on each other. The cart service which is the only way to obtain a beverage or some food never comes. This is due to insufficient luggage space, the train becomes rammed with people's luggage which is anywhere and everywhere, so the cart can't get through. The luggage problem makes it hard to exit the train as you may have to put your luggage 2 carts away. I would seriously spend the extra \u00a3 and travel in comfort with LNER.",

The LNER journey was so much better and no more expensive than Lumo as I booked in advance. I really wish I had booked LNER for both trips. Lumo is cramped with no room for luggage - other people had already stacked all their luggage above our seats when we got onboard. There are very few seats with tables - I always try to book 4 seats around a table as I travel with my 3 children, it makes for a much easier and relaxed journey. Aisles seem cramped, the trains old and run down.  In short I will always book LNER in future even if it costs more!",

        "review_text": "I travelled on a Lumo train today for the first time, from King's Cross to Edinburgh.  I was wondering how a Lumo train would differ from a normal one.  Here are the differences.  1.  There is very limited luggage space.  Staff moved my suitcase to a different location far from where I was sitting and turned it upside down.  Only small bags are allowed on the overhead racks.  If the staff find a bag in the wrong place, they hold it up in the carriage and shout \"Who owns this one?\"  2.  There is no buffet.  3.  There is only one toilet per carriage.  Expect to queue to use the loo.  4.  The seats are all airline style (there are no tables) and have enormous headrests.  This means that thoughout your journey you can see nothing in front of you except a large piece of plastic inches from your face.  5.  There is little legroom.  6.  The arm rests are only an inch wide and so your body may well be hard up against that of the stranger next to you.  My ticket was \u00a338.90.  The lack of luggage space and the staff moving your luggage about make the journey stressful and the lack of a buffet is a pain.  In future I will be careful not to book a Lumo, even if it means paying more.  (I have since discovered that there are restrictions on luggage.  No one told me this beforehand.)",

Had absolutely no customer service skills at all and was almost like they're trained to be rude and hostile towards their customers. The train was chaos before we'd even left with around 10 announcements that were very passive aggressive and rude, and sounded like all customers were being told off. It was genuinely like it was such an inconvenience for the staff to board the train. \n\nI fell asleep and was rudely and aggressively woken up by the ticket man who didn't even gently nudge me, but very forcefully woke me up and was shouting at me to see my ticket. Baring in mind this was 6 in the morning, absolutely no need for that behaviour. He continued to be rude throughout the whole interaction and no apology for his behavior or for waking me up so aggressively. \n\nStaff were just very very rude the whole time and didn't seem to enjoy their job or want to be there. Most of them definitely didn't have a clue how to do their job as well. It was a very unpleasant experience and I've never received such bad customer service in my life. \n\nTrain was also delayed by 40 minutes but apparently we are not entitled to any compensation. Not to mention as well that the train is cramped and very uncomfortable. \n\nI get that they're cheaper than LNER and Avanti but really not by much, just pay for them and don't bother with lumo as you'll be getting much better service. Already complained to lumo but doubt I'll get any kind of response from them as they don't seem to care at all for passengers. \n\nStill so so shocked with the absolutely appalling service I received and can guarantee I will not be using them again.",

The only thing to remember is that any train service is part of the main rail infrastructure (which has its faults) and that's beyond Lumo's control and people expect a lot for very little.

On the first occasion last year we simply got on the next available LNER service and I was even able to book a seat - so annoying but not that inconvenient. Today I received no email regarding the cancelled train even though I booked directly with lumo, whilst people who booked with train line had been advised.  On arriving at the station the  information desk advised we should again be able to travel on the next LNER train but to try and book a seat. On going to the ticket office LNER staff said this was not happening and we would have to go and catch a train from Euston - a lady in the queue had tried that and they were not accepting any further lumo passengers. We were then told we would have to go on the next lumo (2 and a half hours later) but could not book a seat and everyone may not get on. So I ended up buying a ticket for the next LNER train that I could book a seat on (2pm) There was no lumo representative at King's Cross and all Lumo's contact centre could offer was advice to call and complain which I intend to do but would have preferred customer service on the day. The LNER staff said these cancellations were happening more and more and basically that you get what you pay for. I won't be using this service again.",

He also helped with our luggage. Thank you Andy. Coming back on the 2/5 the train was already crowded with passengers from Edinburgh, luckily we had a brilliant member of staff called Lindsay to help us. She guided us through all the carriages and found us two seats, all on our own and we were able to lay Louie's bed out for him, we had room for our luggage and plenty of leg room. We felt like 1st class passengers and it made the journey really relaxed and comfortable. We just wanted to say a huge thank you to Lindsay, her kindness and caring manner will not be forgotten and we will always be grateful. She even got off the train to say Goodbye to Louie.

        "review_text": "In November last year I booked return tickets to Edinburgh. Within an hour or 2 of booking I realised the return train date was wrong and I wanted to cancel it and rebook. As it was within the first 24hrs I was eligible for a refund and was advised via their live chat tool that I could complete a refund request and get it back in full. I filled in the form and it confirmed it was being processed. \n\nWhen I realised I still hadn\u2019t received the refund by January this year, I contacted them and they advised initially I didn\u2019t qualify for a refund, when I shared the chat transcript from my first case they advised I actually was eligible and that they\u2019d send me a cheque in the post because they can\u2019t do a bank transfer refund.\n\n6 weeks later I still hadn\u2019t received the cheque, I got in touch with them again and they told me they\u2019d left the flat number off the cheque and would reissue it. Another 5 weeks later, I still hadn\u2019t received a cheque so I contacted them again and they said they\u2019d need to cancel the second cheque to reissue and would email me to confirm, an email I\u2019m still yet to receive.\n\nIn amongst all of that I submitted a complaint form, no one got in touch with me but I then received a survey from a third party asking me to rate how my complaint was handled.\n\nI then contacted them on social media who gave me a customer service email address, it took a month for them to reply with an answer that obviously highlighted that they hadn\u2019t read any of the cases I\u2019d shared with them because all the answers were in them, including the fact I\u2019d never collected the tickets and that I qualified for the refund. Please note, I was advised in one of the earlier cases that if I had retrieved the tickets I wouldn\u2019t have qualified for the refund. So even their CS team contradict themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s been 6 months since I first got in touch with them and it\u2019s still not resolved.\n\nGenuinely, it\u2019s the worst customer experience I\u2019ve ever had from a company, it seems like a complete clusterf*ck. It baffles me they can only operate using cheques despite paying by card and that they rely on \u2018industry standard\u2019 SLOs (service level objectives) with a response time of 28 DAYS to justify their complacency!!\n\nIt\u2019s actually a shame because the first part of my journey on their train was actually quite pleasant.",

Also, this train was clearly designed for very small people. I am 6ft 3\" and the table which I could not stow away, was lower than the top of my knees whilst sitting straight. It was really uncomfortable. For 3+ hours it was hell. I had to lay down in my chair for the table not to touch my knees.\n\nThere was no food car and it took 1.75 hours before the food trolley reached us. \n\nAwful service.

I then called their support team number (not listed anywhere) but it is 0345 528 0409 - best to call Sundays. I explained that they were not duplicates. Received an e-mail the following day from the case worker that he had made a mistake and could see that they were not duplicates but stated that the image of the ticket was of such low resolution that the ticket references couldn't be read and that I needed to send another one with a higher resolution. I've e-mailed back informing that the resolution is perfect and exactly the same resolution as the ticket that was approved, and to avoid the same at their end I listed all the ticket reference codes (4 in total).

        "review_text": "I bought some tickets with Lumo directly in December, having seen that I could change my tickets online anytime before the train - perfect for COVID changing times. We decided driving was more safe the day before the train and tried to change our tickets to early 2022 that evening. The website wasn't working so I took screenshots to prove this and emailed them to Lumo and woke up very early the next morning to try again. No luck and Lumo got back weeks later to say they could see that we had tried but because it was past the train they couldn't give a voucher. I obviously contested this and after months of bad service I contacted the rail ombudsman. Promptly got a response from them saying that I could have a refund. Seems as though they are able to provide service but only when prompted by a larger power than themselves. Not only did this take months of me prompting them but it was terrible service. I would love to be able to charge them for the time I have taken to chase them up (eve though I had good evidence of the fact it was their website's fault) but I am content to now have a refund. Thanks to the ombudsman.",

        "review_text": "Used Lumo for a return journey from London Kings Cross to Morpeth and return.  There is good and bad with Lumo.  Fare was competitive, staff really friendly and seat more comfortable than the hard seats on LNER - there are also 'wings' each side of the headrest to rest your head.  However seats would be more comfortable still if they were covered in wool moquette, like the majority of train seats rather than less comfortable flat-cloth.  On-board catering very limited - best to purchase something at the station / in advance and take it on board.  Luggage space also an issue, though I think part of the problem is compared to rival LNER with has short distances between stations with many passengers are travelling on day trips, with less luggage, on Lumo with the longer distances between stations, most passengers will be staying away and hence there is more luggage per passenger on average.  Lumo should have thought of this and provided more luggage racks especially at the end of the coaches where there are no windows.  By far the worst thing with Lumo is there is no choice in seats when booking, so can end of with an aisle seat or whatever when you would rather have a different seat.  Fortunately there were some empty better seats when I travelled, so I was able to move.\nNote that some reviewers booked Lumo with thetrainline - why do that?  With the thetrainline when booking in advance you will always pay fees which the train companies do not charge when booking direct, so you are just wasting your money using them.",

This was the 3rd time I have used Lumo for travel to Newcastle and back to London. Never had a problem . I don\u2019t travel with luggage but can see passengers with excessive luggage struggling. Like the fact that it is booked seats only-no more arguments on busy LNER trains with walk ons taking booked seats. Trains always have space as it would appear that there are a number of no shows. Staff always friendly and like the update from driver about progress. Can\u2019t comment on customer service issues as I have had no need to contact but have noted that you can\u2019t move your booking if,for whatever reason, you can\u2019t travel-you lose your money. It\u2019s good to have more competition on this route as LNER can be very expensive.",

Welcomed on board as if part of the family, great trolley service, comfortable seats, equally as good as other operators.\nI loved the little touches like the driver talking to passengers about why we had gone slowly from York to Thirsk and it was cos the train was actually too far ahead of schedule. He also advised us that one of the crew had her birthday today, so everyone wished her happy birthday as she passed through with the trolley. A great and friendly experience and would book with Lumo again when we are back to London in March.\nWe were dead on time at the end of both trips so what more could you ask for. Well done guys, keep up the good work\u2026",

        "review_text": "First, despite being a brand new train, it may be the worst I\u2019ve ever been on. To get the price down, they have clearly chosen to reduce the quality of the service. The seats are okay, they get a plus for decent winged headrests but they are VERY narrow seats so it is unavoidable to make contact with the person next to you. \nNow, the main issue, there is a severe lack of luggage space, to the point where it is almost a joke. I took the train from Kings Cross to Edinburgh and clearly people are going to be bringing luggage, I myself had just come from Heathrow. This made boarding the train a nightmare and absolute chaos. During this, the staff were very rude to myself and other customers, complaining that we had brought too much luggage and berating us for it. According to the rude staff, they have a 1 bag per passenger rule\u2026 which isn\u2019t advertised anywhere. It seems baffling to me to a train company that only operates long distance services, from a major transport hub (which also houses an international train station!), has sacrificed luggage space for a couple of extra seats.\nDespite the slightly lower price, I will not be travelling with Lumo again. LNER trains are not great by any means, but Lumo is significantly worse.",

(though I did see luggage piled up in a disorganised heap in a hatch at the end of the carriage) \n\nThe only criticism I have is that there were no sandwiches available on the trolley service (only if you had pre-ordered them, which is too much of a bother) - the only savoury item was crisps. My favourite fruit cake which I always buy on train journeys was not available either.\n\nOverall, though, I was pleasantly surprised.",

The scene was unbelievable, because the staff didn't tell them to stop the music or turn it down, they even had laughs and fun with them instead. It was impossible to rest, work or have videocall work meetings, so be very careful if you have to be working on your way to London. Thank god they got off the train in Newcastle, it was so annoying, and how the staff acted was very inappropriate, why do we have restrictions if things like this can happen without any kind of sanction, punishment or at least reprimand?\n\nThis happened the 4th of November, and I am writing writing a review right now because I initially contacted Lumo about this issue and they took several weeks to make a proper reply.\n\nSo, if you have to be working, or you would like to rest on your way to London, be very careful because probably there is a party going to Newcastle and the staff won't do anything, leaving the rest of the passengers annoyed and unable to have a comfortable trip.",

People are having to stand the whole 3hr trip.\nLumo sells itself as a low-cost rail operater but disgusting how they make money by cramming everyone in like sardines.  Cheap is one thing but having no consideration for passenger safety and welfare is another.  Everyone on the train is not happy.\nWe are regular train users but we definitely will not be travelling Lumo again until they sort out their booking system and putting a cap on how many tickets can be sold.

        "review_text": "Utter garbage of a service and no customer service to speak off especially when there are issues. First time I have used it and the train had a fault and didn\u2019t turn up. We were then directed to a packed LNER train leaving an hour later. That train got into Edinburgh at 1617 when the original train should have arrived at 1427. You would then think claiming the delay would be simple. Their website is awful. Makes you waste a lot of time which I assume must be to deter people from claiming. I claimed and only just received an email saying they disagreed with my delay claim and say it was less than an hour so will be refunding me half my ticket value - oh how kind and incompetent. Wonder how they think that happened. To appeal you then have to go through the same tiresome process of reloading ticket, etc. Clearly they are not cut out yet to be running a company if they cannot even deal with the simplest of events. They have now wasted a lot of my time but at no point has there been an apology. We were treated like rubbish at KX. Stick to LNER as Lumo is clearly not ready and make it very hard to contact them.",

Of course their advice is: we cannot help, but you can book another ticket (at an inflated fare). \n\nCheap in more ways than one. No way to get in touch by phone, so long waits for a response. Which means prices rise a lot by the time they give you that helpful suggestion.",
