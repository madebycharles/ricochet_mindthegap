Luckily today the seat was empty, maybe it due to being around 7am, but usually occupied. None of the digital displays above the seat were switched on though, nor any cards put out for reserved seats, it maybe early morning commute but you still get these problems of seats being taken, especially window and table seats. I don't blame the staff on the train, blame the company as a whole.\n\nThe WiFi which they boast is excellent and free was terrible and free. Signed up, connected and nothing worked, constant loading and whirring. It may work at other times of the day, but on a morning train full of people using laptops, phones and other comms devices, it was just permanently loading, had to resort to using Web when near a built up area or pulled in a station, draft something offline and save then send in a short window when connected to my own 4G. Luckily I have an unlimited amount, but for some on limited GB of dated, it must be awful!\n\nI didn't see any staff present, again I don't blame them, probably got 1 poor person having to try and get up and down a train and deal with the doors too.\n\nNext week I am getting the Mega Bus to Bristol from the West Mids, under \u00a310 to get there and under again to get back, think it's around \u00a316 return, no stops, so like a train, if I wanted to get the train, it was avanti for the first quarter, it was the cost of the whole journey for the first leg! with multiple stops.\n\nRail is bad and this company is falling behind, their only saving grace? They are better than Arriva who had the line beforehand! ",

The trains are crammed with  uncomfortable, narrow seats with little leg room. The one I had did not have a window save for a tiny portion of the one in front. I had a backward facing seat which makes me nauseous and no view. There are no charge points, no tables, the flip up was too small for a laptop. The train was smelly, particularly near the loos and the smell permeated the entire train carriage. This is the national trainline and why this contract was given to Avanti is a mystery unless it is corruption in government as one review suggests. This train 'service' represents the UK. Imagine the impression it gives to visitors to the UK? It's like a third world travel experience! Bring back Virgin Trains please.  ",

        "review_text": "Welcome to the world of Avanti \u2013 Britain\u2019s worst performing train operator! The worst element of yet another formerly iconic British institution now gone to the dogs, thanks to greed, inefficiency and incompetence. No interest whatsoever in providing a decent, well-managed service for the public, and utterly clueless about customer relations. With 83% of Trustpilot ratings being one star, and not a single comment from the company in response, as far as I can see  \u2013 that tells us everything we want to know about this outfit. The owners living in far off parts of Scotland and Italy, with the gall to call themselves FirstGroup and Trenitalia! They should hang their heads in shame, and lose their contract as a so-called train operator. However, in fact, their contract has even been extended.\n\nMy gripe, though, on this occasion is not with the trains themselves, but their refund procedure. I know it wasn\u2019t their fault that we never actually had the pleasure of using their trains. We booked online tickets from North Wales to London and back for the Easter week. Then the nasty unions declared yet another strike, so we couldn\u2019t travel by train. Getting a full refund for the outward journey on Friday from Trainline was simple and efficient. However, the return trip on Sunday had been booked through Avanti\u2019s own website, which decreed that I should be charged \u00a310 per ticket for requesting refunds \u2013 a nice little extra money-maker for Avanti for doing absolutely nothing. It may be true that Sunday was not actually a strike day (Friday, Saturday and Monday were, so we knew Sunday would be disrupted, too, as last year), but if we were not able to go on the outward journey, how could we be expected to travel on the return journey, and why should we have to pay any fee at all for requesting a refund for the return journey?  Naturally, there was no place on the Avanti online refund service to allow us to explain this. Then, to rub it in, several days later (when I had already received my partial refund) I got another email to remind me of my upcoming journey! And then, after the day of the intended journey, yet another email asked me to rate my experience of the journey \u2013 but with no box in which to write any comment! Totally idiotic, totally inefficient, totally unfit for purpose.  \n",

Just utterly unreliable, overcrowded, aggressive staff, facilities that rarely work, Wi-Fi that is practically unusable, and excessively overpriced.

And the old adage of a cheap wine being like paint stripper is true in this case, the stuff they serve is dreadful.\n2) Don't try and change the time of your ticket, that apparently is too much for them.  It's okay though to buy new tickets without getting a refund.  This by the way to move the time from 3pm to an earlier midday train.  I know from experience that the train will not be anywhere near full.  One could speculate that their arcane rules around tickets is merely to coerce more cash out of people's changing circumstances.\nWhat can I say \"Avanti West Coast - the company that makes you want to go by car\"",

Apparently first class is complimentary so no compensation due because I had a seat. 5 hours on a packed train, no water nothing, buffet car even out of service for entire journey. So thoroughly miserable journey for \u00a3206. \u00a342 refund only for the delay, Because I had a seat. Standard class for the same train was \u00a378 with exactly the same service. Plus a traveller with standard ticket sat with myself and received the same refund of \u00a342.\nSo if you fancy treating yourself don\u2019t. \nAwful journey for double the price. \nColleagues treated differently with the same claim. They received a refund of \u00a3135 in total.\nFlights easier next time I think.",

I've never travelled on a Pendolino before & was only on this service as Kings cross was out of service for a few days.\nIt was only 10 minutes or so into the Journey & the heat in Coach F was unbearable ( Seat 28) I ended up with just my T shirt on &  I  was still very warm.\nThe heater fan would cut out & 20-30 seconds later it would cut in again. Fortunately I had 2 1litre bottles of water with me but these were gone 2-3 hrs into the journey. I hope this was a fault with the coach  & not standard for a Pendolino.\nI was grateful when i got off at Haymarket into the fresh air & even better when I got on the LNER Azuma to finish my journey to Montrose, Much more comfortable & not as stifling !!!\nA very poor show AWC.\n",

Their carriages stink of chemical toilets because the air inlets were designed too close to the toilet waste outlet vent (this is a know fact), so you can quite literally go and do your business and then bask in the glow of its smell (and that of your fellow passenger excrement) for the remainder of your journey. It is not healthy, my wife felt quite ill from the smell. For this privilege, we forked out the best part of \u00a3300.\n\nI requested a refund due to strikes, assuming it would be paid without issues. I've since been chasing the repayment for nearly seven months and have been informed 'I've requested the payment too late' because they 'can't find my request on their system'. They now expect me to provide screengrabs as proof of something that happened seven months ago.",

Absolutely useless when you need help on the day. \n\nThe trains themselves have become extremely overpriced when Virgin used to be somewhat reasonable, and yet you get less for your money. I used to get first class tickets for less than I'm getting standard premium ones and you get nothing with that. \n\nAlso Club Avanti is a good idea, but the execution is awful, only way to access if via the emails in your inbox, no way on the website to view membership and rewards. With emails things can easily get lost so it becomes pointless and not worth even having.\n\nPlease bring back real humans to speak to via chat or phone call!!",

When travelling between England and Scotland, I'd say almost half of my journeys involve a complete stand still at some point as we 'wait for a driver to arrive'. This happens with the kind of frequency that rules out technical faults or even sloppiness. I think it's a circumstance they knowingly undertake on a regular basis, rather than fix the wider service or resolve manning issues. Customers are clearly an afterthought. Storage is often an issue also, regardless of whether or not the carriage is actually full passenger wise. I.e. overhead racks barely offer any height to luggage, compared with say, LNER trains. This results in the 'large item' storage at the carriage ends being filled with what I would consider to be medium sized bags and cases. That's all for now.",

Had booked seats but train absolutely packed so no way to get to our seats ! Eventually went to standard premium to get a seat. Train manager ( use that term loosely) said we need to either pay or fight through the carriages to get to our seat. So I paid !! Off to get the form filled for compensation. Oh and also 20 minutes late. Remember you always have the option to fly or drive but please don\u2019t go anywhere near Avanti , without doubt the most pathetic, zero service company I have ever come across",

My outbound journey on 21st January was declassified, no first class service provided.  My return journey was also declassified.  Again no service provided apart from a small bottle of water and a packet of crisps given to every passenger.   The Avanti First Class Lounge at Euston was of a similar low standard.  Not one urinal in the men\u2019s toilet was in working order, no catering provision in the lounge apart from a can of Pepsi Max.  It\u2019s obvious to me that the fat cats at Avanti don\u2019t use their own service as I\u2019m sure if they did they wouldn\u2019t accept this third class standard.   Who was the bright spark that removed the franchise from Virgin?  We in the northwest deserve better.  Avanti need to go, but until then we are forced to continue to use their sub standard cattle truck service.",

But I have to blame the 2nd driver for being such lazy, They said that for people going to London has to get out of the train and take another, Like whats the point. The drivers are completley lazy just to take you to where you wanna go! Then the 3rd one got us late to watch the match as we missed the 1st half! Complete Bad experience this!",

Boarded a busy-ish train with a suitcase and two smaller carry cases, with concerns about finding a seat where I can keep visibility of my cases throughout the journey. On coach C, two staff unloading boxes for the shop witnessing my bemusememt were quick to inform where luggage couldn't be stored, without offering helpful directions as to feasible alternatives. \"Try up there or further down the carriage\". Only after making a comment to another passenger about the unhelpfulness was there some attempt to seek out space for the luggage. \n\nPretty much what I've come to expect from Avanti - a negative reactive response rather than proactive service.

Went to booking office and was told I cant get on this train unless I paid another \u00a394.00 (2X\u00a347). Why because it wasn't the one early but the second one. When I questioned and said this doesn't make sense as the train will no doubt have lots of empty seats.. And this was what i was told.. NOT MY PROBLEM I ONLY WORK FOR AVANTI AND ITS THEIR POLICY NOT MINE. SO EITHER PAY THE DIFFERENCE OR LEAVE THE QUEUE AND WAIT FOR  7.53AM. So as Taxpayers we subsided the Train company's coppers for a service that is not fit for purpose and they continue to treat us like the Avanti customer service person who told me that IT WAS NOT HER PROBLEM  Avanti cancelled (apparently no drivers) and pay double the fare for an empty train ..

        "review_text": "I would like to say thank you to Avanti West Coast for looking after my Mum so well today. I normally drive her home to Birmingham when she stays in London with me. But unfortunately yesterday my car broke down and I couldn't get it fixed before I go back to work tomorrow. \n\nSo at very short notice I booked a train ticket for my Mum and booked assistance for her (she's 86 with osteoperosis, bad knees and anxiety).\n\nWhen we arrived at Euston's assistance lounge we were taken directly to the train. During her journey the train manager came and checked on her a number of times and when she disembarked at Sandwell & Dudley the assistance worked seamlessly at disembarkation - seeing my Mum into the main lobby where her cab driver was waiting.\n\nSadly, I don't expect good service very much anymore from any organisation but today it worked and I'm grateful.",

Fortunately there were some other seats however the poor family in \"our\" seats were clearly embarrassed at proving their right to sit there. Train manager said this was a regular issue and we should complain. We will, and not her fault: felt sorry for her dealing with it. Return train was cancelled and we had to cram on to an earlier service and stand all the way. Yes, there was strike action however the tickets were bought and booked the previous day when the action was already timetabled-in. The cost of this route is extortionate for the misery endured. Take my advice: NEVER travel on the Avanti route if you have a choice. Birmingham to London is much better via Chiltern: takes longer, but costs half as much and never messes you around to this extent. Learnt my lesson: I won't do this again. Others beware.",

        "review_text": "Firstly train delayed but not too bad but as we were on a train ( first time in years) my husband and I are nealy 80 and I have mobility problems, 50 miles from our destination and they announced it would be terminating at Preston. No announcemants as to what happened next we were stranded. Fortunatly my son in law was tracking the train and got a train from Penrith to preston to assist us we eventually arrived tired and stressed 2 hours after our supposed arrival.\nIf this wasn't enough the return train, 3 days later was totally cancelled so we had to arrange another overnight stay. At 4.00am we received a text saying it look as though we might be lucky to get a train at 8.15 that morning which we did.  Now all of this was bad but the Delay team apptly named ...should be customer avoidance team having missed the fact our train was cancelled and mearly focused on our delay leaving MK, The form  was a nightmare as when completed it would,t go through so I had to phtop copy everthing and send to customer services, will say at this point customer service was very good and did try hard to help. Perhaps they should be transfered to delay team.\nWould I travel again on a train? which I might add was soley as my husband will not drive long distances because of our ages, but never again. Will await the out come so watch this space! I.m definitly not letting this go.",

I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re paying gate staff for this level of Orwellian policing, but whatever it is they\u2019ve sucked all empathy from their staff. \n\nMy railcard had recently expired unbeknownst to me. Now I know you need it good and ready, but mistakes happen due to the old condition known as \u2018being a human being\u2019.\n\nI had ten minutes till my train departed. Admittedly, it was a cheap fair for a 2 hour train to Lancaster at just \u00a3140 one way!\n\nPart of me thinks the gate staff enjoyed telling I had 5 minutes to purchase a new one. Unfortunately I probably validated his behaviour after that, by as he put it, \u2018cussing\u2019. No **** Sherlock you just ruined someone\u2019s day for a company that, no doubt like all big corporate bodies these days, doesn\u2019t frankly care you exist.\n\nMoral of the story is, if you\u2019re going to act like a policing bellpiece, at least get paid enough for it and show up on the picket lines.\n\nAvanti toss pot.\n\n(For comparison, whenever I\u2019ve had issues in the past, whether on my part of the rail company, I\u2019ve been with GWR, who are staffed by (for the most part) normal human beings with normal human feelings).",

Holdall was found and I can collect it next week. Station even sent guard photo to confirm it was my holdall.\nExcellent customer service. I had a rucksack and other bag too as we had our dogs stuff in these \nGuard on avanti train.was so helpful so he and station involved deserve this 5 star review. \nWe also got free tea, coffee and water on Glasgow train. Everyone got this because they had been unable to stock buffet car.\nRerouting was because storm brought down trees and electrical wires which was no one's fault",

I complained again and they basically said tough they do not compensate for stress as they refunded me for unused tickets.\nWhilst travelling back to London from Wolverhampton I had hardly sat in my seat when a lady pushing a trolley asked me if I had a first class ticket bearing in mind other passengers who boarded the train were not asked that same question.Two minutes late she came back and asked where I was travelling to.

        "review_text": "This is the worst service possible at the highest financial cost. Really poor value for money. I used to enjoy travelling by train to London down the west coast, Avanti have ruined that. Trains are dirty and it is a lottery in relation to whether they run on time or are cancelled. In any other walk of life the CEO would be sacked, but Avanti seem immune from accountability or sanction. I have to use this service regularly and every time without exception I am left disappointed. Yesterday I took a train from London, which was delayed by 40 minutes after mine was cancelled. The train was then cancelled from Wolverhampton after it had left London, leaving hundreds of people to squeeze onto already busy alternate services. Had to get off, get another train to Stafford and a further train from Stafford to Wigan. Journey time in total was 4 hours, when it should have been 2 hours. I really hope the goverment takes some action against Avanti, it is needed now, disgustingly expensive, no care for customers and barely provide a service. I expect there to be problems now when travelling with Avanti, which says everything. Fly, drive or walk if you can, will be far less stressful and probably quicker. Bring back Virgin.",

I haven't previously looked to claim a refund but after may last trip where both the outward and return trains were cancelled I decided to do it. I found out that to claim a refund, you have to post the tickets back to them, but unfortunately, I left the outbound ones in the hotel room (my mistake). So today, I went back to Warrington Station to try and get the tickets reprinted. Apparently they can't do it so I asked what my options were. She said there was nothing she could do. Zero help, zero empathy. If Amazon cancel an order that you've placed with them, they automatically refund you. Avanti ask that you send the tickets back to prove you was affected despite them having evidence of your seat being booked and the train being cancelled. I used to travel to London once per month for 2 years with Virgin, not once did I have a train cancelled. This franchise is a joke. Shareholders received \u00a313.5m pay out last year despite customer complaints being 10 times the national average (business live report), it's time to re-nationalise the rail network, \u00a313.5m reinvested in the customer experience would go a long way.",

She said she could change my ticket but when she realised I had a premium ticket, she said she couldn't change that type of ticket. She suggested my best option was to get a ticket at the station on the day! Having spent an hour between the two calls and trying to purchase a new ticket through Avanti, only to fail repeatedly,  I ended up buying a new ticket through Trainline. Dealing with Avanti is a terrible experience.I've repeatedly been re-imbursed from Avanti due to the trains never running on time or cancelled.

        "review_text": "I had the misfortune of having to use Avanti West Coast trains today and I really wished hadn't or that there was a competitor.\nBuying a ticket these days should be a simple quick affair but Euston ticket office is a throw back to 1970's Britain a decade when nothing worked.\nI needed a ticket for immediate travel and made the mistake of thinking the ticket office would be the best place to get it.  The queue at 10.05 had stretched through the whole of the ticket hall (which uses a snake system) and then as the queue was getting longer, three of the 5 counters closed.  This was already after a number of us had been queueing for over 20 minutes or more adding so much time to purchase a ticket.  Do remember that the ticket machines are programmed only to sell the most popular tickets and not the cheapest tickets which even the UK Parliament have also complained about\nTo add further insult, a member of Avanti staff then decides its fully acceptable to queue jump a customer from somewhere else on the station and doesn't even have the common decency to say for example 'sorry folks I need to help this customer' but instead keeps his back to us and makes everyone else who had patiently queued up suffer even further delay in buying their ticket.\nWhen I got to the counter - I asked why did they close three counters when there was a massive queue, the answer I got was 'we've got our breaks to take'.  I wonder if in a properly customer oriented company this would be acceptable, as any sensible company would deal with the queue or let one person at a time takes a break not three at once, but it seems the staff at Euston ticket office think this is acceptable behaviour.\nI asked to speak to a duty Manager to complain but I was told we've not got one and there hasn't been one here for ages.  The lack of anybody in Avanti at Euston taking ownership or being accountable is to me a clear two finger salute to their customers.\nSo if you want a taste of the UK from the 1970's then enjoy the ticket purchasing experience at Euston.  You will only do it once, I can assure you...",

        "review_text": "Outstanding Customer Service! On a recent trip to Edinburgh we arrived at the station to grab a bite to eat before the journey home only to find that due to an electrical fault pretty much ALL trains were cancelled! Every other train company were advising people to either taxi to Glasgow or stay overnight and try again the next day. However, AWC customers were directed to join a queue on platform 2 and await further information. The staff were doing their upmost to speak to all of the worried people stranded in Edinburgh. We were given the option to wait in this queue or find alternative accomodation / travel. So we waited with a couple of hundred others. Staff kept updating us and quickly moved anyone with children to a seperate queue and an onward journey. One member of staff walked the queue and promised us all we would get home and to bear with them. We assumed we would be put on a coach and maybe taken part way / to another train station. What we did not expect was for AWC to put us in a taxi with instructions for the driver to take us home... we shared a taxi with 3 others who were headed back to Birmingham / Dudley and all of us were taken home, not to a train station or loaded into a coach for 7/8 hours! AND to top it off we were refunded for the return journey!!!! Am actually amazed. Outstanding customer service. Thank you to AWC. Great job. Would definately recommend.",

        "review_text": "We travel four times a year and I cannot ever remember when Avanti ran the service when the trains were running on time or when our train was not cancelled. My heart goes out to anyone who is unfortunate enough to need to use your train service on a regular basis. The seat reservation service is a joke with either the reservation screens not working or them not showing that the seats are reserved and from which station. \n\nOur return journey from London Euston to Carlisle was the 30 November. We turned up at Euston station only to see that our 5:30pm train had been cancelled due to no train staff (utterly f u c k i n g pathetic excuse when they know well in advance the staff numbers) and the next train which would bypass Birmingham was the 6:30pm train out of London Euston. This train was late and did not leave London Euston until 6:48pm. \n\nThis train was absolutely rammed, people standing in the coaches, people standing and blocking the vestibule areas on the train with luggage. Surely this is a safely concern which should not be allowed to happen. Your train service resembles something you would see in a third world country and you are an embarrassment to the UK travelling public. \n\nI have a loathing of Avanti that you could not measure. You are by far the worst train operator in the UK and I hope the time when you lose the franchise is imminent as you treat your customers like s h i t. And also to add the recently agreed pay rise, then I think the service should improve 100 percent before any pay rises are given!\n\nBring back Virgin trains, although not perfect, they were light years ahead of the shower of s h i t of a train operator called Avanti.",

I waited until 23:00 and decided to get the Overground to Watford Junction as there was no sign/indication that any trains were going to operate again any time soon - was probably only a matter of time before my train was cancelled too. I then got an Uber from there which took 1 hour. Before this, a member of station staff at watford junction told everyone who had made the same journey that they could request a refund from the individual train operators for the inconvenience caused. The day after I requested a refund for the Uber journey only from Avanti West Coast, in which they asked me to provide information on three separate occasions. It was only after the third time of providing receipts/information that they told me they couldn't provide a refund as the train was only delayed, not cancelled. It might as well have been cancelled as I had waited a considerable amount of time already, especially at that time of night, and there was no indication at all about when the next train would be. What did they expect everyone to do in that situation? I could have waited until midnight and then all the trains could have got cancelled for all I know - what would I have done then?\nExtremely disappointed by this, as well as the constantly terrible service by AWC.",

        "review_text": "It does not surprise me to see that Avanti West Coast has such a poor review status. On the 25th November my wife and myself booked First Class same day return to London from Lancaster to meet up with my Sister for her 50th Birthday. The journey to London was lack lustre for First Class, the carriage separation doors were broken so every time the train stopped the carriage became freezing cold when the external doors opened. The return journey was harrowing! The trains before and after our scheduled train had been cancelled by Avanti and all customers from these trains were told just to get on to our train, it was packed beyond safe standards and the duty of care for the individuals was none existent. My wife and I who had paid \u00a3504 for the whole journey found ourselves without a seat and had to debate with those how had taken them from the previous cancelled train. The carriage was full of returning football supporters who were disruptive and threatening towards my wife and myself. There was a disabled individual also in the carriage with his children who also received abuse. When the train got to its final station Preston it was like a mass migration trying to get to the connecting train which again was filled beyond capacity.  My wife and I decided to get a taxi home as the experience on the last train was traumatic. We contacted Avanti who after some debate agreed to refund the taxi and the for part of the First Class fee. I am a Army Veteran who has a veterans discount card, Avanti only refunded me for the First Class to Standard which they said was \u00a325 per person. I did a price check prior to purchasing the First Class tickets. For standard tickets with Veterans Discount was \u00a3174, First Class \u00a3504. So if you do the maths it\u2019s more than \u00a325 per person. I will never travel with this company again and I have also informed my company to boycott them. I regularly travel to London and Aberdeen for work from Lancaster. I will find alternate transport! I am still taking it to the Rail Ombudsman, just waiting for the 40 days to elapse!",

Yes as a so called valued customer this is how much we care about your experience and stress \u00a30.00 !!\n\nSorry doesn't mean a thing when you spoiled everything and left me ill and exhausted and as I was informed by a avanti staff member that the trains get cancelled if they are low costomer numbers so to save money and to squeeze customers onto other trains and to buy higher price tickets as they are put in a desperate position and then get ripped off. \nShove the apology it changes nothing !!\nI'm utterly disgusted, what a experience  !!!\nShambolic  !!!",

I knew that we booked a single train without switches and asked if this was ok as it did say the refund was invalid after activation. They said it was ok, but this invalidated the refund for switching trains, and then they looked at the tickets and said they couldn't be switched... They clearly do not care about our time or money. Their customer service was less helpful than doing nothing, and they have no power to change anything, the online systems are all you get.",

Its a shambles and yet on the basis of ongoing shocking performance they've been given a 9 year contract extension! The answer should be that in addition to refunding the fare there should be a compensation payment as well?  They might then get their act together",

Not surprising maybe working for this company. When we did get on our late running service today, no buffet facilities from Glasgow to Preston. Just awful management. Almost every time I travel with Avanti it's the same. Why would they want to improve their dismal record when the government fund them to run an incompetent service badly and pay compensation for their miserable useless service.

When we got on the train this morning, we made it as far as Preston before the train got terminated (deserving of a Nobel Prize when you consider how bad British transport services are) even though the journey was awful, it was made up for by the wonderful train manager who I believe was called Derek, who remained enthusiastic despite probably being stressed out of his mind- hope he has a beer when he gets home, he deserves it. What a legend. But long story short do not get on an Avanti West Coast Train unless you want to spend days of your life in deep thought as to why you\u2019ve made this horrendous decision, perhaps consider riding thousands of miles via unicycle instead as it would probably be more efficient and much cheaper- final shout out to Derek, but pls Rishi can you fund some trains now not being funny but I\u2019ve had enough. \nXoxo Jaime",

Every week there is either a delay or cancelled train which causes overcrowding. This means I have to stand for 53 minutes before I get to work in the mornings or after work. Worst thing is I am paying about \u00a342 a day for a train ticket for a 53 minute journey (this is with a railcard). This is when I take the off peak train. Would cost be above \u00a360 if I could take the train I wanted to. I wake up at 6:30am and get home at 8:15pm everyday I go into work. Usually even later with the delays. This is by far the worst train company I\u2019ve ever used.",

An announcement was made over the tannoy about his anti-social behaviour, but he was not restrained in any way. I had the misfortune to be in the same carriage as the individual concerned on the journey between Warrington and Stafford (Edinburgh Waverley to London Euston 18:52 service). Let me tell you that it was extremely unnerving seeing a man repeatedly headbut a toilet door, ask people for drugs, swear profusely and prevent other travellers from walking down the aisle. I am amazed and thankful that nobody was hurt. What I can't get my head around is why he was simply left to his own devices? Is it company policy to allow anti-social behaviour on trains to occur unabated? A new light touch approach? I assume (and hope) the individual was arrested at Stafford station as there was a police presence. What I can't understand is why nothing was actioned on the train to keep myself and other travellers safe?",

The guy just walked off with a smirk on his face.\nI\u2019m sorry but I work in customer service and, it\u2019s tough, I get it! I\u2019ve had people complain to me about things that were beyond my control over and over again and I have never walked off on them like this before. I wasn\u2019t even having a go at him.

Avanti are STILL citing shortage of staff as one of their many excuses. Services are then overcrowded as a result (sometimes dangerously so), wifi doesn\u2019t work properly on the trains, catering is often inadequate and payments can\u2019t always be made by card because of the wifi, the website doesn\u2019t operate efficiently, seat reservations are absent on the overhead screens causing chaos. The list goes on! Worse is when you discover on arrival at Euston that the Glasgow train will be starting at Preston. I use this service very frequently and am sick to death of it. We\u2019re being encouraged to use public transport to get us off the roads but what incentive is there? \nHave just read today that the Transport Secretary, in his infinite wisdom, has extended Avanti\u2019s franchise contract by a further 3 years because of their improvement. Words totally fail me and clearly he doesn\u2019t have to endure the shambolic service provided by this totally inept company. This is the 21st century for God\u2019s sake but it might as well be the 18th.",

Even when she had to help with an elderly gentleman with the toilet buttons. \n\nAlso the service was spot on from the timing of arrival and departure. \nReading through the other reviews I couldn\u2019t match this service to anyone\u2019s experience. They must have had a bad day or got out the wrong side of the bed. \n\nThankyou 10:58 team from Haymarket for a fantastic faultless service.",

It\u2019s generally a terrible service, very poor compared to the previous Virgin trains. \nTickets are expensive: there is poor availability for any deals and sometimes tickets are only available a few days in advance, which makes it difficult to plan.  Delays are frequent and over half of my journeys are delayed enough to claim compensation. There are many other problems - the Wi-Fi is often not available/patchy, plug sockets not working, coffee machine is broken, food/drinks not available, dirty toilets. (Today we have all of these problems, plus delays). \nSome of the staff are quite nice - that is the only positive thing I can find to say about this company. \nI look forward to the day they lose the franchise - wish I could give them a minus score!",

        "review_text": "Here we go again with Avanti. I've just booked to go down to London for a weekend, which is circa 7 weeks away. I booked the outbound fare as soon as it came out over a week ago, have been hanging around for the return ticket to be released as it is engineering-work affected. Turns out that despite being this far out, it is only \u00a36 more to fly back (staggeringly - cheaper had I flown at a different time), so that's what I'll be doing. \n\nCirca \u00a375 for a (very) advanced return, it can't have been that much more than that for an on the day off peak fare when Virgin had it. You could certainly get a return for significantly less when booked at the earliest opportunity. The fact Avanti have just had the contract significantly extended beggars belief - driving is now a better option if I'm going with the family, and these sort of prices will simply be out of reach for low income families.\n\nI have noted that there is now a \u00a320 \"Superfare\" if you are very flexible what time you travel. Superfare at risk of not being available during engineering works according to the FAQ's so I couldn't afford to hold on and have to extend my mortgage for a not-quite-so-advanced fare nearer the time if the \"Superfare\" was unavailable. Additionally, if I go with family then the Superfare FAQ's state \"little ones need a Superfare ticket too at the same price as an adult\". So would I have to pay \u00a340 each way for a 3 year old and 1 year old who would otherwise have travelled for free - completely removing any benefit (also no guarantee of being in the same carriage, ahhhh that's ok I'll just stick the baby at the other end of the train should I)? Or are the FAQ's just woefully inadequate? The mind boggles.",

Carrying a bike isn't as big a problem as, say, Crosscountry, even if you take into account the mandatory reservations. \nThe ex-Virgin non-refurbished sets are by far the most comfortable trains on the entire UK network. The refurbished sets have seats which I find much less comfortable than even Thameslink's seats! It is rather inexplicable why companies do this.",

Very animated conversations about dumb customers and generally talking shop. It was like the staff break out room! I mentioned this to the manager while he checked my tickets, but instead of doing anything, he later joined in with the mayhem. Clearly they were entitled and I was in the wrong!  I was pretty much surrounded for the best part of two hours. I contacted customer resolutions who sent back the usual scripted responses with the usual gaslighting phrases. I ask for the complaint to be escalated but instead the same person repeated the same response and added the ludicrous suggestion 'I could have called the British Transport Police'. When the complaint was escalated I was assured it would not happen again. No partial refund or compensation because the staff were the problem. Basically, it was just my bad luck to have been stuck with them. So now the Standard Premium upgrade is apparently a lottery.  Quite how it can be so much more expensive yet worse than Virgin Trains is a mystery. Loathsome company.",

At one point we were standing in the 'bendy' bit joining the carriages.  They then proceeded to stop and let more passengers on at various points!!!  Eventually gave us a new train at Preston and guess what - SAME NUMBER OF CARRIAGES- so standing all the way to Carlisle.  And when you complain and tell them you will never use them again they send you an email saying this is acceptable because if the train is too full it cuts out and won't move, and here's a code for 25% off your next trip!!!!!

My account issue was with the service over all, the number of passengers on board, no seats available at all, passengers are standing in the aisles also sitting on the floor everywhere even between the carriages where no one supposed to sit or even stand there for the health and safety reasons. Unfortunately even the health and safety was not considered by them both ways. \nWhen we arrived Coventry I went straight to the member of staff who was standing by the platform to tell him and inform him with the situation on board but unfortunately he did not care at all even when I mentioned that the health and safety procedures were not there so he looked at me then replied; \u201cStay at home and don\u2019t go out to use our trains\u201d\n\nI was in shock to hear that from a member of staff of Avanti train by the way his name was Gabriel. \n\nIn conclusion;\nVery poor service \nNo professionalism\nRude staff \nBreach of health and safety",

Virgin staff no longer operate the barriers there.\nI had a reply from avanti west coast who suggested I refer the referred thematter to network rail, avanti claimed, they - network rail, man the barriers at this train station in Birmingham.\nIts avanti staff who man the barriers at thst rail station and their uniforms and ID badge that confirm they man the barriers there.\nSo, avanti have no idea that their staff man the barriers at Birmingham New Steet station? Rubbish! Seems to me any excuse by avanti want to bypass complaints and/or ignore complaints.\nWhat a rubbish train operator indeed. I've quit fully using avanti train services here on.\n\nI've had to complain about staff at Birmingham New Street station previously. Too many rude staff, clueless staff, etc. This rail station isnt too great at the best of times, I've found, especially since its reopening after modernisation was carried out there a few years ago.\nI asked one member of network rails staff where the platform escalators were, recently, his reply was 'I'm not sure'!

        "review_text": "I'm in shock - I usually award 1 star.  Avanti have made my journeys a misery from their first taking over, to the point where I only travel with them if I must. And I've complained many times. I travelled Liverpool to London and back last Friday and Monday.  To my amazement, for the very first time, both trains were on time (the outward arrived at Euston 4 minutes early!).  The carriages had undergone a makeover, new(?) dark blue upholstery, clean, comfortable, an in seat plug in and charger, electronic information board, aircon working and just the right temperature.  The shop was open (I never use it, mind).  The staff on the train and at Liverpool were visible and pleasant but not so much at Euston.  I still have a few grouches - the crazy price of the ticket, and the inevitable moron in the quiet coach who insists on gabbing on their mobile throughout the journey.  Sit in another coach, why can't you?  Also the usual scrum boarding at Euston.  Announcing the platform just 7 minutes before departure is too late for anyone who's not a trained sprinter, and keeping the ticket gates shut so that everyone has to get their phones out or push through paper tickets that don't open the gates adds to the mayhem.",

So tight that my elderly parents won't risk it. You have forced my eight five year okd father to drive the distance! I don't know how anyone with mobility issues can even travel between north wales and london by train.

HONESTLY!!!\nso on Tuesday 1st August 2023 I went Manchester for an job interview at the prison, due to rushing i left my charger in London, I wasn't allowed bring my phone in the prison so I could asked them to charge it. After finishing my interview I wasn't left kind of stranded and no phone!! My interview finished at 5pm so walked about 40mins before I found a pub which the manager was so lovely she called me an taxi, when I entered the taxi the time was 6:38pm which means I've missed my train for 6:06pm due to issues beyond my control!!! After I got to the station I explained this to one of the workers who was quite sympathetic due to the ordeal I've faced but he apologise because he doesn't work for Avanti he then point me in the direction and said just explained to them what you've told me, they should have procedures for situations like this.\nAfter speaking with Avanti worker she told me it is my responsibility to make sure my phone is charged and that she cannot help me and I need to spend an extra \u00a373 to get to London, mind you I've already spent \u00a3103 for a returned trip!! Like I know I missed my train and believed me if I knew where I was I wouldn't have missed it!! They didn't put non of this into consideration i cried and I pleaded that I had no more money to pay \u00a373 for the tkt they then started ignoring me!! The other workers fell so bad and pulled me to one side and said buy yourself a tkt to Stockport which is \u00a32.75 and just board the train and come off im London! I did this then they start treating me like criminal telling they need to see tkt or I won't be allowed to board the train!! Thats when the guy at the information desk called the manager and he was able to get me on a train to Crew and frome Crew to London!! I won't be home until about 1am so I've been left stranded by AVANTI WEST COAST and would of still be stranded if it wasn't for Northern Rail. Avanti west coast is beyond disgusting the thought of them taking my money is actually mind boggling!! Why take the customers money if you can't help your customers in time of need!! I'll NEVER use this service again I rather drive the 4hrs drive before this disgusting company gets another penny out of me!!! Something needs to be done or you A-HOLES need to stop operating because your customer service is beyond abysmal.",

        "review_text": "Absolutely disgusting treatment of my 15 yr old granddaughter this morning at Coventry station.   She was prevented from catching her train by a jobsworth who told her she shouldn't be travelling alone and if her mother cared about her she would have been there to put her on the train. My granddaughter's parents have both passed away so the remark was hurtful and caused her severe upset. When my granddaughter phoned me in tears I spoke to the member of staff on the phone. She said I should be thanking her as she had a duty of care to my granddaughter to make sure she was safe as she was too young to be travelling alone. The last time I checked,  it is not illegal for a 15 year old to travel on the train alone.  She eventually allowed her to board a train,  but as she was late, she missed her connection at Liverpool Street, so in actual fact she put my granddaughter at risk. I have raised a complaint with Avanti and will be taking the matter further.",

Had to kneel on floor as machines are designed for short people only. None of the machines would work with my fingers on touchscreen. Once again had to get staff help. Absolutely hate travelling this way. If ticket offices shut God help anyone with an issue. Try calling them. A total waste of time. I would give them zero stars if possible.

        "title": "Absolutely disgusting",
        "review_text": "Absolutely disgusting! I'm not even complaining about the train that my 11 year old son described as \"dirty and smelly\", I'm complaining about the car parking at Wigan North Western train station. There is barely any room to park on the 'drop off' site where you are allowed 20 minutes wait time. Wanting to arrive early to collect my son, I had no other option and so parked on the multi storey car park owned and operated by Avanti. The entry system seems to be deliberately confusing as they have 2 ticket machines, one for free parking up to 20 minutes or one for longer. As I was close to the 20 minutes I chose the 2nd machine for longer and read \u00a34:50 on the VERY long notice attached to both machines... you can't possibly read it all as there's usually someone behind you acting impatient, plus you end up blocking a busy road if there's more than 2 cars there. \nThe train arrived late (of course) and after collecting my son and walking back to the car, I'd parked a total of 38 minutes. I put my ticket in the payment machine and was asked to pay \u00a312:50!! I and several other parents had no option but to pay it so we could get our cars out, but I e-mailed Avanti West Coast to complain. The response I received back was not only an obvious copy and paste, it didn't address a single point I'd raised! It seems you either park for 20 minutes for free, or you're charged a full day. they have no other option for 1hr etc... which I would have happily paid.\nREPLY FROM AVANTI\n\"Thank you for contacting Avanti West Coast regarding our car park charges.\nWhile we\u2019ve invested a lot in our car parks, the daily parking rates at our stations had stayed the same for years. So we felt that a review of this was needed. To bring us in line with the tariffs of nearby car parks and to increase the capacity available for customers, we decided to change our pricing structure.\nThe current charges reflect the considerable investments that we\u2019ve made in our parking facilities to improve them, including adding hundreds of car parking spaces at our busiest stations.\nBecause of the increase in non-rail users at our car parks, both monthly and three-monthly car park tickets are now only available to rail passengers. And our annual passes are also considerably cheaper for rail travellers than for non-rail users. You can find out more about parking at our stations on our website. We\u2019ll pass on your views to our Car Parks Manager so they can use them as part of their next review.\nThank you for contacting Avanti West Coast.\nYours sincerely,\nCaitlan\nCustomer Resolutions Advisor\nAvanti West Coast\"\n\nThey may as well have told me to go stick my head in a bucket. I'll be avoiding Avanti at all costs in future.",

        "review_text": "This morning I encountered the most unhelpful and unpleasant employee, working for Avanti West Coast at the ticketing barrier at Birmingham New Street Station. Thanks to the rudeness and uncooperative manner of staff working for Avanti West Coast, who lack the ability to use their own personal judgement and discretion, I was held up at New Street Station and not only missed my connecting train but also missed out on an important job interview that could have made a vital difference to my family of young children during the cost of living crisis.\n\nI arrived at New Street at 9:10am this morning; having purchased an Anytime Day return ticket almost an hour before setting off on my journey via the trainline app using PayPal. But there were issues with the Trainline app that prevented me from downloading my tickets. So I was unable to use the QR scanner at the ticket barriers. I explained the issue I was having with the app to the lady at the barrier, I showed her emails with my ticket confirmation and the PayPal receipt as proof of purchase. I asked if she could swipe me through the barriers so I could catch my second connecting train departing at 9.15am to University of Birmingham because I had a job interview. She refused to assist me despite seeing all the proof I had shown her. She even accused me of having not purchased the train ticket until I arrived at the barriers hence the reason I was having issues downloading them in the app. I told her this was not the case and explained that I had also experienced a similar issue with my first train at Birmingham Moor Street Station that morning. But the gentleman at Moor Street (who works for a different company) used his discretion and swiped me through the ticket barriers because he accepted the email confirmation I had shown him. The Avanti employee insisted I purchase a new return ticket from the ticketing office, where I spoke to another lady who bluntly informed me that issues with the Trainline app is not their concern. She stated that both herself and ticket barrier staff at New Street do not work for Trainline and they couldn't assist me further unless I bought new tickets for my journey otherwise I couldn't travel. Both employees showed an absolute disregard for customer services, making my experience today utterly horrendous. Shame on you Avanti for employinh staff who lack human empathy.",

Terrible customer service \nNo contact phone or email on website .\nThey announced free refunds for those who bought tickets for strike days but when you try to dop it online there is no option to do it for Advance tickets. As an alternative they tell you to use a form but that requires you to attach a ticket photo, which you don't have. This looks like deliberately making it nigh impossible to claim your rights. \n\nUpdate- customer care staff had not been told the requirement for photos had been lifted for strike affected tickets, and they processed a refund, This hasnt arrived within the promised 5 working days. They say they cannot speed it up. Funny that - my cancelled hotel could refund me within 24 hours \n\nAvoid them at all cost - book on another wesbite. If you can travel down the East Coast - EMR have been excellent.\n\nAvanti should lose their franchise - Many of us miss Virgin.",

I thought they might have improved, so tried again yesterday. The journey from Birmingham to London was fine: fast, on time.\nThe return journey was not so fine. We had booked seats in carriage H; there was no carriage H. (Not the first time I've encountered that issue with Avanti.) We were able to find seats, apart from each other, in another crammed carriage (several passengers had to stand). The train was half an hour late leaving Euston, because the train driver had not turned up. We sweltered in a packed carriage for all this time; no driver, therefore no air-conditioning until he or she arrived. The train arrived in Birmingham half an hour late. We were at least reminded that we were entitled to claim compensation.\nI shall continue to avoid Avanti in future.",

I have visited England and then Wales each time on three visits in the last 18 months.  it is RARE I would write a review such as this.\nMy experience has been that I have found Avanti to verge on 'Business Dishonesty' on each train trip I have booked with them in the following way.\nThe latest June 2023 was from Euston to Crewe.  Two trains were due to leave, the first for Glasgow via Crewe and the 2nd for Bangor via Crewe. [My trip].\n12 hours before the trip Avanti canceled my booked service and merged ALL the passengers onto the 1st Glasgow train via Crewe.  \n1] I overhead 'stressed' staff complaining that Avanti had also left the train at 9 carriages and DID NOT increase it to 11 carriages\n2] People were left without their booked seats and sitting in the carriage door entrances as a result - a serious health and safety issue.\nThis was the first part of the trip, I will not bother relaying the 2nd part equally as bad.\nI personally recognize packing carriages as a 'Revenue Grab' as I had the same experience on my previous 2nd trip with my Avanti booking last year in 2022.\nIt clearly stands out to me now, as a standard 'unprincipled business practice', to pack trains to maximise Revenue, which in turn 'unconscionably' does not deliver the COMFORTABLE SERVICE the Passengers had paid for in good faith and can reasonably expect.\nI ask the question - How often does Avanti do this?  Weekly?  This question should be answered officially by a government regulator.\nIn short the business should be ASHAMED.",

I travel daily between Birmingham New St. and Coventry. Accordingly, I either end up on a Crosscountry, London Northwestern or Avanti train. Crosscountry are usually late, the trains are packed and dirty and you seldom get a seat. On Crosscountry the toilets are often dirty and smelly. In comparison, Avanti trains are clean, of comfortable temperature and always have plenty of available seats. They usually run punctually and much of their rolling stock is brand new. They also have a buffet car with vegan options which is great for me. When I had to write to them, they emailed me back a day or two later - not weeks or months later like other operators. Ultimately I get on whichever train comes first, but I'm certainly happy on the occasions this is an Avanti service.",

I could've booked a return flight to Europe for less. \n\nIt was 29 degrees outside and the A/C on my carriage was broken - It was absolutely unbearable. The train set off 10 mins late and after 45 mins of travel a member of staff came round to give out warm water which I saw them take down from the luggage rack on our carriage. Obviously they were aware the A/C was broken, but still decided to let everyone board the carriage. \n\nI thought it would be the same story on every carriage, but moved to another where the A/C was on full blast, only I had to sit on the floor as there were no seats free. \n\nI complained to customer service but apparently I'm not entitled to a refund because the ticket has been used! That is shocking customer service. In fact, it's some of the worst I've experienced in a long time. \n\nIf I could leave a 0 star review I would. I won't ever travel with AWC again and neither should you!",

We made it back to London and headed to Euston to board our train, which was departing at 9:40 pm to find the station and platform entrance rammed with Coventry fans from the championship play off. Whilst waiting to get onto the platform we heard MULTIPLE fans laughing and commenting on how they DIDN'T have train tickets and were planning to just jump on the train. A few minutes later they announce the service has been cancelled, only ten minutes later to admit that it's actually that the train is full. Me and my partner has seat reservations and spoke to someone explaining that someone would be in the seats that we'd booked and how that's fair to which no one helped. Avanti have clearly either sold more tickets then there were seats OR have allowed people with no tickets to board, meaning paying customers haven't been able to use their tickets. We ended up having to repurchase tickets from Marleybone to Birmingham Moor Street. We emailed Avanti about all of this providing the evidence of purchase ect. to which they tried to tell us we needed to go through trainline, eventhough trainline had already emailed us the following day telling to contact avanti about compensation, so they're obviously just trying to shift the blame. Me and my partner asked for a refund for our unused tickets and asked them to reimburse the tickets we had to buy due to their mistakes with the original trains. They sent multiple emails asking for all the evidence just to turn around and tell us that because we used the tickets we couldn't have them reimbursed. Yes. We did in fact have to buy MORE tickets to USE them to get home so I'm not really sure how that makes any sense. \n\nConstantly shifting the blame. Refusing to take any responsibility.",

        "review_text": "Unbelievably awful service from Avanti West Coast.\nI had arranged a week in North Wales and, having a broken bone in my hand, and being in my eighties I decided to treat myself to a First Class seat to/from Holyhead/Euston.  What a waste of money.  First Euston called the train ten minutes before departure it was a long walk to the platform and a long walk down the platform to first class.  With minutes to spare I asked a member of Avanti staff to help me with my luggage.  She refused.  Having got on to the train, after about 20 minutes, I was offered a cup of coffee and some water.  That was the last I saw of the lady on my four hour journey.  No food, no drink. Nothing.  There was apparently a \u2018shop\u2019 on board.  I have no idea what that is all about, but having paid such a lot of money for my seat I sat there expecting service \u2013 none came.  With a broken hand I could not possibly carry food and drink down a moving train.   The return journey was only marginally better.  The guard came to see me and told me there would be no service between Holyhead and Crew.  Thankfully he saw my hand in a splint and kindly offered to fetch a cup of coffee.  Then nothing until a member of the catering staff got on the train at Crewe when I did manage to get some cheese and biscuits and a glass of wine.  DO NOT book yourself First Class with Avanti West Coast \u2013 you won\u2019t get any first class treatment.  \nI wrote to the MD \u2013 his assistant offered me 50% off my next journey as compensation.  They gave me a long spiel on how to get that 50% off.  It was a bit beyond me and I have no intention of using Avanti West Coast again.  After spending \u00a3163.00 on my return ticket I asked if they could not just pay be some compensation.  I was offered \u00a310.00!  I turned it down as an \u2018unbelievable\u2019 gesture.\nAs one person has written \u2013 you would be better off in a tuk tuk with 20 chickens rather than use Avanti.",

        "review_text": "Avanti is the worst train company in the UK, probably in the world, including developing countries. It would probably be a quicker and more pleasant experience to travel from London to Manchester in a tuk tuk with 20 chickens.\n\nMy sister tried to get a train today at 13:47, which should have arrived in Manchester at just before 4pm. Instead, it did not depart until 3pm and did not arrive back in Manchester until after about 6:30pm. She was travelling with her 6 month old baby so it was an even more stressful experience.\nShe was charged \u00a325 for the \u201cprivilege\u201d of sitting in \u201cstandard premium\u201d even though the train was very busy and ridiculously late.\nWhen Virgin ran the trains it was a pleasant, reliable and affordable service. Nowadays, booking a ticket to Manchester with Avanti is like playing Russian Roulette as you never know if the train will be cancelled and therefore whether you have to cancel plans with family. If the service does go ahead, you pay an absolute fortune for a not particularly pleasant experience, with some trains so busy that people are forced to sit on their suitcases by the toilets. My brother in law lives in Manchester but has to travel to London for work regularly. Unfortunately, he has to rely on Avanti trains, meaning he is frequently late for work and important meetings. This is unsustainable. The service is so unreliable that he is considering looking for a new job.\n\nThe price has gone up through the roof despite the service being such a joke.\nWhen I go to see my family in Manchester I usually drive these days as I can\u2019t count on the trains anymore. Avanti needs to relinquish the contract for the West Coast Mainline - it wasn\u2019t prepared to take it on and hasn\u2019t coped. When you speak to staff, they agree that Avanti is an abysmal company and aren\u2019t happy with their experience either.",

On one occasion I had to stand up from Nuneaton - (several passengers are usually standing for the whole journey.) On another occasion the electric toilet door opened whilst I was using the toilet! And the stampede to get on the trains from Euston is incredibly  dangerous - they don\u2019t release the platform number until the train is about to depart so you have to run to catch the train or try and get a seat! Two stars are firstly for the train staff who, despite the obvious problems with Avanti, I\u2019ve always found to be helpful. Secondly the train managers do keep passengers informed about delays and thirdly at least the trains run frequently between Manchester and London. Try and avoid busier trains and your journey will be a lot more pleasant.",

I was greeted at Rhyl station and asked for assistance, which I was given despite not having a reservation the train manager helped me to the seat and contacted Crewe Station where I was to be met and helped from the train. The TM who unfortunately I didn't take the name couldn't do enough for me. Avanti West Coast gets a bad rap, unfairly in my opinion I will make a effort to travel more on my disabled railcard as I now know that help is their if required l so I'd like to thank the station staff at Rhyl/Crewe and the station manager on board that day for making a stressful journey, as easy as it could possibly be.\nJim Wootton\nDisabled passenger",

The man in the shop was really good and explained why there wasn\u2019t any table service onboard and offered meal deal. \n\nReturn journey was a totally different experience. Sat on our seat and the attendant asked us what we wanted to drink and if we wanted anything to eat. We ordered coffee and told the attendant we will have anything as long as it was vegetarian. We got coffee but no sugar (in the end didn\u2019t get the sugar) The attendant bought 2 plates of food and slammed it in front of us, it had salami, pepperoni and ham on the plate. I reiterated that we were vegetarian and we can\u2019t have the food she bought over and said it doesn\u2019t matter, we didn\u2019t need food. The attendant stood there, staring at us for a good 30 seconds, huffed and just walked away, it was like she wanted to hit us lol I\u2019ve never had someone stare at you in anger when you\u2019ve been so polite.\nThe attendant changed at Wolverhampton station and we had a different person and it was totally different service. The attendant bought drinks over, biscuits, chocolates and kept on asking us if we wanted anything else. It went from the worst service to having the best service. \n\nThe carriage on the return journey was a refurbished one and it was really nice to see modern features like wireless charging and more comfy seats",

Unless you\u2019re very wealthy, you\u2019ll be crammed on and treated like a criminal if you sit in the wrong seat or get a train 15 mins out from the one you paid for. \n3) The bare minimum features for travellers, such as WiFi, don\u2019t work. WiFi just doesn\u2019t work whatsoever. Don\u2019t even bother. \n4) Terrible, overpriced food. As if you\u2019re not spending enough.\n5) Unreliable services that often don\u2019t run on time.\n6) I could add another 7 or 8 of these, but I\u2019ll stop. \n\nThe crux of this demonstrates that Avanti West Coast is a simply diabolical service. A visual representation of the years of damage done to this country by this inadequate, profit-driven government. The rest of Europe, many with nationalised services, offer affordable, effective but thrill-free services for their people.

        "review_text": "Absolutely disgusted with the service. Booked the tickets using the Avanti App to attend a family funeral, wanted to go by train so as to avoid any added stress. On the morning of the funeral went to Nuneaton Station to retrieve the tickets, keyed in the booking reference code, did not recognise it, tried again, again had the same problem. Spoke to the very unhelpful and rude lady behind the counter who tried the code but it did not work for her, she said that it was not her problem that I needed to speak to Avanti, went outside to try and speak to someone, lines were not open. I then went inside and said to my partner that I would ask for a refund for the original tickets and we would purchase new ones, I was advised that it would cost \u00a3190.00, I stated that we had a railcard, she said that we could not use this before 9.30 as per the terms and conditions, although Avanti let me book the tickets using the app, we were then advised that it would cost \u00a3300.00. We were therefore left with no alternative but to drive, adding to the cost that we had already incurred with having to put petrol in the car, this is what we wanted to avoid the stress of driving, this is why we chose the train in the first place. I requested a refund of \u00a3125.20 on 27th March 2023 and after much toing and throwing, I am still waiting for a refund. The customer service is shocking, the complaints procedure is even worse. I will think twice of ever booking with Avanti again.",

        "title": "Tactical Avanti membership ploy....no intention of giving a discount",
        "review_text": "I became an Avanti member yesterday morning as they advertised that you would get a 10% discount on your first booking. I had received a notification telling me that advance tickets had been released for a journey I was taking so I was keen to get it booked, however, wanted to wait for the discount code to come through. \nIt got to 9 pm last night and I had still not received my code or acknowledgment that I had joined. I did not want to miss the tickets so I booked them.\nToday around 10 am, I received an email with a discount code. This angered me as I had already booked. While I understand that I could have waited, I have waited for things like this in the past and when I have gone to book the tickets have gone or gone up in price. I could not risk that in this situation.\nI have just called Avanti and spoken to Hayley. While she had lots of information for me, it was not helpful at all. She offered to cancel my booking so that I could re-book it with the code. I asked her to check that the price was the same. Surprise surprise, it had gone up by \u00a312. Therefore, If I were to cancel and re-book I would actually end up paying more.\nThis really angers me. I believe that this is tactical and they have no intention of giving customers any discount. Hayley also went on to mention, that the Avanti Club membership is nothing to do with them, so actually if there was an issue with the code they couldn't help. I replied with the basic facts that the membership is offered on the Avanti website. How the business is split up is no concern for me, as a customer it is just another opportunity for a company such as this to collect data under false pretenses. Shame on you. This train had better be on time and running otherwise an unpleasant review will be coming this way.",

        "title": "What a tin pot company",
        "review_text": "What a tin pot company! I will never book tickets with Avanti West Coast again, I'll go back to trainline.\nI booked tickets to London for tomorrow, just 2 weeks ago, and I booked the only type of ticket their website offered, which was \"advanced\", I upgraded to standard premium, for extra legroom, at a cost of \u00a350 each way. I have tested positive for covid today so don't want to travel and infect everyone on the train. I clicked on the \"refund\" link but got into a loop where there was no option to request a refund. Instead, I had to fill in a form, and I received a reply that they won't refund any of the ticket price at all, because I booked an \"advanced\" ticket, to save money... \n\nThis was the only ticket they offered me, and the price now is no different from what I paid, I didn't save any money by booking a specific ticket. They're not offering to refund me the \u00a3100 I paid for standard premium either. I've asked them would they prefer that I travel instead and infect all of their other customers, they've just hidden behind some deeply hidden terms and conditions which state that certain ticket types are non-refundable. \n\nWhat a surprise, by the way, the link on their email to complain to the ombudsman has an error in it so it doesn't work, you have to go around the houses to put in a complaint!\n\nAt this point I will also say, don't bother traveling first class with this tin pot company, either. \n\nI traveled first class with them a few weeks back, and on the outward journey there was no service, because apparently, they didn't have staff, so if I wanted anything I had to walk all the way from the front to the rear of the 11 coach train, to get it from the shop myself. \n\nThe return journey was fine, as they had staff, and the service was great, nice staff. When you consider that the extra cost of first class is about \u00a3130, though, and the extra cost to sit in the same seats just without the service (standard premium) is \u00a350, it means paying \u00a380 for a grilled toastie and a gin & tonic. Nice gin & tonic though to be fair ;-), and they did bring me a top-up.\n\nWhile I'm ranting ;-), on the return journey above, quite a few people came onto the first class coach and were confused, as they'd paid for premium standard and there didn't appear to be any head rest covers to specify premium standard. I overheard a conversation where a customer was told that there was no premium standard option on this train, as it was the first offpeak train that evening, they were doing an experiment with not offering premium standard on that journey.  \n\nThe customer obviously didn't feel this was fair, and asked how they were supposed to know not to get on this train, and he was told that he should have noticed, before boarding the train, that there were no standard premium headrest covers ;-).\n\nAgain, tin pot company, avoid.",

        "review_text": "Every time we have used Avanti West coast since they took over Virgin, we have had a problem. Double booked seats, broken train, endless delays. Companies are allowed to make mistakes, but when rail travel is the clear solution to road congestion, and hence bridging a gap over the North-South divide and handling CO\u2082 emissions, I find it such a shame that a poorly run company is making it so difficult to get into London by train. I hope for the future that these reliability issues can be resolved so that travelling by train to London can be, once again, an enjoyable experience. Please note that all Avanti employees I have encountered have been very helpful and pleasant, it appears that solely the management and funding are to blame.",

        "review_text": "I have been travelling between Birmingham International and London Euston since 2006, for the last 10 years self funded as I am self employed, rather than company expensed.\n\nFor the last 3 years I have been travelling by car since the impacts of COVID, having previously used monthly season tickets with Virgin, and later Avanti, including zone 1-6 pass as I work near Wandsworth Town (2 further connections and a walk). These are not cheap.\n\nI decided last week to attempt to use public transport again to reduce the impact of my personal carbon footprint using the car. This cost me close to \u00a3300 as I decided to encourage myself back onto the train, for the first time in my life I would travel first class. The morning journey was an absolute delight. I thought, this is definitely worth it. Then came the afternoon\u2026the 17:16 from London Euston didn\u2019t have any first class service, which I\u2019m assuming is a regular thing as nobody seemed to make much of a fuss. I had been looking forward all day to a luxury journey home with table service in which I thought this is definitely good value for money. Now, I am left without a clear way to reclaim my refund as it wasn\u2019t delayed, but I didn\u2019t get what I paid for. The car journey costs me \u00a370 in fuel, and \u00a320 in parking\u2026.so in effect I feel as though I have paid almost \u00a3200 for a sandwich and coffee.\n\nTo add further insult to injury, the onboard shop was only accepting cash\u2026which I never carry as also since COVID, cash isn\u2019t really circulating anymore, so I am now facing a journey with no option to eat anything after planning to eat on the train.\n\nI\u2019m so disappointed and feel like I am better off sticking with the car journey and a sainsburys meal deal as the refund isn\u2019t going to be easy to obtain and it\u2019s now more stressful than the drive would have been.",

Why? The e-voucher was a refund for a cancelled train so why am I being penalised by having to pay a third more for my ticket in order to use my e-voucher despite me paying for the railcard?

The Reservation from Euston showed until about Stafford, so if whoever had reserved it got on, I wouldn\u2019t have had the seat from Birmingham International.\n\nThere have been occasions where other passengers have resided in the seat reserved for me and told me it is reserved for them, so I don\u2019t know if it is true or they are liars who can\u2019t be bothered to get out of the seat. With all these problems, Avanti needs to get the reservation system sorted out before there is a punch up.\n\nI was acknowledged by Avanti saying they will be in touch within a few days, that was seven weeks ago and I haven\u2019t heard anything more from them.\n\nWith their overpriced advanced purchase tickets they can get stuffed. I shall avoid paying their ripoff prices by driving so far and getting regional rail rovers instead. I can drive to Crewe and get an extended West Midlands Day Ranger to explore the West Midlands, but the journey to and from Crewe which is a fraction of what the journey around the West Midlands will be is twice the price of the day ranger.

Extremely badly done eyeliner woman, I really hope you get fired, although going by the reviews below this might just be Avanti\u2019s style. I will certainly avoid dealing with this company at all costs after that.",

For \u00a3100 I\u2019d expect great service but instead I was sat on stained and highly uncomfortable chairs, with no wifi so I wasn\u2019t able to order any food or water for the duration of my journey and on top of that there were barely any charging ports.

They were happy to refund the ticket so I could rebook but claimed I would be charged for the refund plus the amendment! How can they justify charging me an admin fee twice for a human error! Also one of the errors was on their side from the app! I persisted and demanded an explanation as to why I was being charged twice, and got told it\u2019s policy?! What policy? The operator wasn\u2019t able to help me and couldn\u2019t find a manager on site\u2026\u2026.so now I\u2019m \u00a383.10 short and don\u2019t have a ticket to travel!!!

Sie schalten den Tag einfach nicht frei. Mal wird an dem Tag gestreikt. Dann bekommst du eine Mail von Avanti, dass nun nicht mehr gestreikt wird. Aber der 1.4. wird trotzdem nicht freigeschaltet. Forget it, wir haben jetzt den Bus gebucht, der braucht zwar l\u00e4nger, kostet aber viel weniger. Und Avanti soll einfach den Betrieb wieder aufnehmen, wenn die Mitarbeiter wieder Lust auf's Arbeiten haben - dann aber ohne uns, wir haben fertig mit dem Unternehmen!",

A panicked enquiry at the desk tells me it is still running. The surly desk clerk looking suitably disinterested and unapologetic at the confusion. Then the tannoy announces that it is cancelled due to a points failure.  A further visit to the desk tells me it\u2019s still running. The screens then tell me it\u2019s running but from a different platform. I eventually get on board. Soon after Wigan, the shop is shut because there is no running water. The service is late getting into Euston making my connection very rushed. Conclusion - no one uses the train because the service is dreadful. Because no one uses them there is less revenue for investment. Lack of investment means it is run on a shoestring which makes the service poor. Circular argument. And then they go on strike wanting more money\u2026",

Yes 21 days he's much too far in advance for a vantage to cope with. I am disabled. This train booking must be made before I can make on the bookings such as hotel rooms and event bookings. I have already missed event and one holiday because by the time I got my tickets the rooms my wanted got booked and another occasion Juventus kits sold out. There is absolutely no way but this outfit should be giving any more extensions to their contract. They should be replaced forthwith with the company that can deliver a sensible timetable",

However, since it has been taken over by Avanti it has been a nightmare - the staff at the station (Euston) are rude and will do anything not to assist passengers when issues arise - I had a ticket seller who literally avoided eye contact with me and the other person in front of me while making us wait for over 5 minutes while joking with a colleague. When asked for name to make a complaint ran away to office without paying any attention to us. We were stunned. \n\nAnother seller sent us to the ticket machines instead. \nI have started avoiding Avanti - the alternative journey with LNR is slightly longer but oh so much more pleasant and reliable. I just change at Rugby and can get to Birmingham in 1 hr 30 min instead of 1 hr 15 min. It's absolutely worth it. Can't wait until Avanti is stripped of its contract. Please write to your MP.",

Train then declassified with no food being served. Only bottled water. Overcrowded, overheated, noisy, luggage strewn everywhere -tripping hazard. I personally had minimal breakfast at 09.30 that day and arrived Glasgow 45 mins late at 17.45 with no food for 8 hours & unable to take medications. When claiming through customer service email,  they said that a standard ticket was \u00a35.80 less, than 1st class, when clearly stated when booked on website was \u00a335! So would only qualify for \u00a35 refund, nstead of at least \u00a335. They should be refunding full money, like Virgin used to do. Have claimed through delay/repay & requested refund goes to children's charity, see if they scam that too? \ud83d\ude21 \nBring back Virgin",

The service this company provides is shocking, which is there after followed up by the horrific customer resolutions team who provide no actual resolution.  My experience involved a last minute cancellation, of which when I arrived at the station the train was ready waiting at the platform before being driven out with no issues. So clearly there was a readily available train with driver, so why the need for a cancellation I do not know. I'm curious as to if Avanti even run trains anymore as having read other reviews I note cancellations seem to be a regular occurrence.  I was then left to endure a bus replacement service for a now 7 hour journey.  The original train journey paid for should only have been 3 and a half hours.  Furthermore they had not even bothered to provide soap or toilet paper in the on board facilities.  Having been a regular user of the west coast mainline when virgin had the contract, I suffered no issues and had only enjoyable experiences.  Avanti however is a terrible experience.",

That company is a shamble.",

But I got a rude assistant that said \"your plane was 3 hours early?? Iv never heard of that happening! Well if you want to get on the earlier train then that will be \u00a3180\" (I never even said my plane was 3 hours early??)\n\nI said I would leave it and wait, and he looked at me all smugly as if to say..yeah thought so. \n\nI would of happily paid up to \u00a366 (which was the cost of my whole journey) but not \u00a3180!\n\nSo I waited, and looked at the early train which was empty! And waited my 2 hours. Then... my train was an hour late and I missed all my connections.\n\nSo now they owe me money for my train being delayed!

Avanti show their first class as a first class service with good seats, great service and the video shows a great choice of food and beverages. Got onto the train, unfriendly coach attendant, only one choice, poor quality bacon sandwich, cheap bread and bacon (have pic if anybody wants it to evidence). Carriage filled with non first class, who all got offered the service until the ticket collector came along and told them they were in the wrong carriage. Then offered drinks tea or coffee, no other offer and asked for another coffee (Mocha), no just the cheapest tea or coffee. Firstly complained to Seatfrog, they were helpful and understanding but could do nothing and need to speak to Avanti. Avanti just use the terms and conditions that nothing is guaranteed or may not be available. The only thing is it\u2019s a shame their promotional film does not show the lowest of their service standards, as they think this is acceptable. Unfortunately this level of service is a complete rip off for an upgrade and they should be ashamed hiding behind terms and conditions. More staff training as to what the service level should be would help too. Thanks for you response, I did think as you were the agent that was paid for this service that you had some responsibility for the service you offer, even if supplied by a third party. I have paid by credit card and if you think the service given was not as you expect then should I claim via them?",

Could someone who monitors this company /the regulator please look very carefully at the new advanced timetable just issued. Lancaster has a severely reduced direct service to London or Crewe with lengthier journey times or more changes the norm and is a forlorn distance from the service provided before. \nTo add to this, I cannot find any reduced pricing for a  Lancaster to Crewe/Crewe/LAN journey no matter how far you search in the future. A train company cannot just pick and choose which train fares to reduce or just ignore. Th cost of the journey above is almost triple the costs of what Virgin used to offer on advanced pricing. \nAt the very least the gov\u2019t needs to put this key mainline service franchise back out to tender. This would at least allow for other companies to offer their thoughts and business model to the table. There are things in life that are difficult to resolve but this is not one of them and the service provided in terms of train performance and pricing needs to be brought back to some level of decency. It is truly out of control for everyday customers who have no other alternatives but to use the car and pollute the environment further.  Please could somebody just look into the new timetable/pricing issue as a matter of urgency as am at my wits end with this \"cowboy\" company!",

When I asked one of the Avanti staff (Mark) if I could go through they said no and thought it was funny for some reason like they were playing a little game with their colleagues.\n\nTo my absolute dismay the same guy - Mark - subsequently let two young ladies through the barrier, I stood there in disbelief. When I asked how come they are allowed through he commented, \"because they are prettier than you!\" (I'm a man in my 40s). So thanks a lot Mark (skinny guy with grey hair at Euston) what a total creep! Can someone at Avanti please explain this behaviour please?",

They refused to let us on the next one and charged us \u00a3500 for new tickets. No compassion for the fact we had zero control over the roadworks or delays. \n\nToday at Euston waiting for a train to Rugby. First two are delayed but third with Avanti due to depart on time. They won\u2019t allow tickets to be used because it\u2019s a different rail operator. Just want money for a new ticket. Again no compassion for their customers - just want the money, always. They tried to liken it to using a flight ticket for a different airline, which let\u2019s face it is really not the same as trying to get a train from Euston to Rugby!\n\nNot to mention the number of times their trains are delayed or cancelled\u2026 probably one of the most, if not the most, unreliable in the country!",

So we ended up have a 2.3 hour journey STANDING. \n\nIt gets better though, the same staff member stated that anyone who has booked a ticket with a seat WILL receive a FULL REFUND. (Some saving grace I guess). NOPE. I reported the refund request immediately to the head office, who apologised and said they would look into it. I have just received an email from them stating that on their records it doesnt show and delays or declassification of any trains.\n\nI will be seeking legal advice on this Avanti West.

They charge customers very high rail fares and give you a poor service how is this right? At one point, a staff member decided that they will look into my complaint and find a resolution and offer compensation which in the end they denied and didn\u2019t offer anything. The lady never replied and she ignored my emails. After a couple of months I get a reply from another colleague who says his previous colleague is not available and working somewhere else in the department which was untrue and a lie. Because a week later that same lady emailed me? I told you they are all liars. This is what happens at managing directors office of Avanti West Coast Trains. There is no customer service. They\u2019ve been rude with me on the telephone and as a long-standing customer, which does not even count. They charge the public so much money but when things go wrong they don\u2019t care and the worst they lie. If you can lie to people, it will come back to you as well. It is the public who are paying you all in Avanti otherwise you would not have a job. Maybe that day will also happen, This is the worst British rail company and should be abolished. The uk government need to take ownership for there failures in dealing with scam company\u2019s like Avanti west coast and control the country otherwise it is only going to get worse, and deal with poor companies who treat the public in this way and lie and scam us that is the truth.",

The breakfast is awful - pale and tasteless.  The dinner options laughable (toasted sandwich or cheese & biscuits or salad ) remembering this is the main meal for travellers boarding at 6pm and not getting home until 10pm.  Tonight I will be 1.5hours late getting home because of a slow running service resulting in a missed connection at Crewe.

Would give minus score if I could.And the time wasted unnecessarily ...Only 2 trains I took left and arrive on time, the rest is utter shambles of train cancellations, delays of a minimum of 30 minutes average and up to 1hour 30 or 2 hours, strikes, double booked seats, frustrated or abusive passengers that are fighting for seats ... Trains are dirty, smelly, overcrowded, seat reservation is optional and not applied,  no advance tickets or timetables ever available, le excuses, no staff on board the train to address safety or passenger issues. They can't even announce engineering works a week before making it impossible for anyone commuting for work to make alternative plans. Then they charge you rip off prices for journeys with multiple changes and no seat guarantee. Sometimes tickets are released only 2 or 3 days before my journey. I had to stay in hotels rather than commuting daily because it has become so mentally and physically draining. Financially I have lost hundreds of pounds because they don't even sell tickets at the best rate weeks in advance. Off peak is a rip off \u00a398, can't afford peak times of travel. Delay repay gives you pennies back, when any trip should come with free counselling session or complimentary alcohol to recover from the ordeal. Government is clearly willing passengers to suffer and stay home, and collapse the North West. There is no reasonable explanation why these crooks are still in business. I wish I could take them to court and claim back the hundreds of pounds and time wasted for nothing.",

This experience was very upsetting and I did not see why I was being told I'm not allowed to put my call on hold and must \"hang up\" when I'm showing a valid ticket very clearly.

        "review_text": "Avanti have got to be the worst train operator going.\n\nSupposed to get the 11:43 train up to Liverpool from Euston.  Trains cancelled \"signalling issues\" apparently, that old chestnut. \n\nWent to the avanti cust service desk who's only resolution was to give me a refund. I said I did order online but the lady said on this occasion can honour a refund but I declined as really wanted to see family. I was a little embarrassed (I should not have been) as I teared up due to the fact I may not see my family who I have not seen for nearly 3 years.  Made to feel silly as no sympathy or compassion from that member of staff.  I had to walk away.  \n\nI went to check in with assisted travel who's staff where far more better than avanti.  Very reassuring and sympathetic as well.  Time was getting on and one hr turned in to two and I was becoming a little upset again.  I went to avanti just to see what was going on.  In my opinion avanti staff should have went round to their customers with updates but instead just hid away.\n\nSecond customer service person was so smug and made me very angry.  Could not give me any info and o asked if I could have a refund to which he said no as I bought online.  I told him what his colleague said and he was like no no no no no no.  So I asked what he could do to help me.  He shrugged and was like \"nothing we can do\".  I asked if I could book for the next day.  \"Stikes\" he said.  I knew this already but they were running a reduced service and were selling tickets online. \"That's of we can get the staff\" he said.  So avanti had times and charging people when there is no guarantee of travel.  That is disgrace.  He was so smug I felt like giving him down the banks but these people would have come out \"we don't tolerate abuse\" card.  We'll us customers should not tolerate poor service.  \n\nI was about to give up the ghost. So calmed down a tad and went to the assisted travel to thank them and then just go back home.  The guy asked which train I was after and said Liverpool.  To my delight he said there is a train for Liverpool where just waiting.  Why avanti could not tell me.  So sat for about 10 mins and then got taken down to platform and eventually went at 3pm.\n\nJust so disappointed and disgusted at avanti.  Also I was in the silent coach where u supposed to not use your mobiles but in this instance I felt like that should have been uplifted.  This poor girl was on her phone calling loved ones to reassure them she was coming. She was speaking low and not disturbing anyone, at the time just me and her before another couple got on.  And this avanti employee barks at her for using he phone. Now he did disturbed me as he was the one making all the noise.\n\nHave done a delay repay but not holding my breath on that one.\n\nWhat really rubbed salt in the wound was an announcement saying we could upgrade to standard premium for \u00a325.   Like really avanti? Should be upgrading for free really. \n\nSo bad.  Gonna take the national express bus next time.  Yes takes 5 and half hrs but would rather do that than use avanti again.",

But then you cancel their returning train and although first class had ample vacant seats you kicked them out making them sit in standard, I say sit but my son in law had to stand, you should never be anywhere near a customer service based company my only hope is your company folds and you are left bankrupt of money as you already are of compassion and morals, I will not forget how you have ruined my granddaughters birthday memories and will ensure I spread the word far and wide!!!

Whilst I appreciate that certain circumstances can not be prevented the advice and customer service we were provided with was absolutely shocking. No announcement was made that our train had been cancelled or why it had been cancelled and if it weren't for my partner checking we would have been stranded in Rugby and would have missed all other trains headed up to Glasgow. When I inquired about what to do I was essentially spoken to like I should know everything about trains. The staff were rude and rushed us over to another platform and suggested we were meant to know our trains had been cancelledll\ned and then changed. Additionally on the way back to Rugby on the 12th December our 8am train was cancelled and we were forced to get an indirect train so we could get home.",

        "title": "A surprisingly helpful staff member",
        "review_text": "I wanted write about a surprisingly pleasant travel experience, finally - instead of always writing about negative customer experiences. I travel several times a year, and most of that time, I need to spend a few hours on Avanti trains, because it's often significantly cheaper to fly from London, instead of Scottish airports, which are closer to my English home.\n\nFirst my negative experiences with Avanti:\nSince Avanti's pricing is a significant portion of my trans-Atlantic travel, I normally buy a fixed-train, advance ticket, leaving hours between flight and train. What I'd really like is cheaper off-peak ticket pricing:  For example, I'm not allowed to take a train that is almost empty, but have to wait a couple hours at a cold train station (Euston) to take a crowded train, the one I booked in advance. Off-peak travel is a reasonable offering, for those who have the flexibility - it's offered by Avanti, but is still relatively expensive, my Avanti experience is some of the most expensive parts of all my travel around the world. British rail services should really be an English pride of the world, but now seems a backwater compared to other services.\n\nAll the slamming finished, I'm going to write a positive review, mostly because of a generous, helpful staff member at the Euston service counter, after being rejected by the platform control staff for a train I was supposed to be allowed to board. Avanti rescheduled my train (earlier), keeping my booking on that one, but stating in an email that I'd be allowed on the train before or after, if that was more convenient, but couldn't keep my seat assignment. Seemed a reasonable response to the situation.\n\nWhen I am rejected on that earlier train, the platform staff tell me that since there's another train that's been recently added to their schedule, and it's closer to my train's original departure time, the \"train before\" is now the one that I originally purchased (and still have the seat assignment). But I've adjusted my schedule for the original \"earlier\" train, the one I identified when I received the original email, just a couple days before.\n\nThe platform \"boss\" said no, too, so I asked who I could escalate this issue to - with less than 10 minutes boarding time left, I needed to go to the ticket counter. I've had bad/bullying experiences there in the past, so I contemplated just waiting, but decided to try. Fortunately, that queue was short and the woman took pity on my freezing, weary self, and wrote/printed a note saying I was allowed on that train. I made it on with a minute to spare!\n\nSo, while my Avanti West Coast experiences are usually frustrating and unpleasant (1-star rated, for many facets), I can say, at least for this trip, I was pleasantly surprised by the kind actions of one helpful soul.  Also, I'm grateful for the mediocre, but free, WiFi service, as I usually haven't updated my local SIM account, so it gives me basic communication until I'm settled again.",

When a guy came to question this I got told to move to standard even though my reservation is for first class train due to their error and when I said the woman said we can sit anywhere that's available he called her in and she looked lost trying to lie her way through she meant anywhere standard. Well that's not what you said when I asked. They messed up bookings and then had the audacity to move us around even though I paid booking fee for this pathetic service to have a reserved seat. Will avoid them from now on. Coach K is first call in any train so saying \"this is a different train\" is a lame excuse. Avoid them at all cost, staff are c*nts, unprofessional. They made the error by giving out 1st class reserved seats to a lot of people and then attempted to charge all of those passengers \"extra\" for first class even though it was their mistake.

Go on the train to first class, but 10 mins into the journey, are told those with transpeni first class tickets to move to standard premium instead, so we have to grab our stuff and move down. cause an hour and 30 mins to the end of our journey really makes all the difference. But it gets better. Then the train stops about 30 mins outside Glasgow for a driver changeover. yes, that's right, we were delayed by 10 mins for a change outside of Glasgow. Why not do it at the end of the journey like a regular train operator? of course, that would be too sensible.",

Mum is not well, and I work fulltime so its stressful enough travelling. However Avanti are the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to use. Appalling.  Consistently delayed or cancelled. And for what? A journey that costs 100 pounds for which you are standing much of the time. I travelled to stockport Friday 2nd December and arrived at Euston to see that all promised journeys cancelled. I'm travelling back now via Leeds to kings cross as again the service cancelled. If this were a one off that would be forgivable. It's not. 2 weeks ago we rerouted via Birmingham and I stood up for 4.5 hours. Similar experiences for previous journeys in recent history. Having spent around 2000 pounds this year - possibly more in trying to get to get connections due to delays - how can you honestly justify this absolutely s*** service. The staff on the ground seem lovely but does not make up for this crap s*** excuse of a train service. Would love to hear back and know how these reprobates might try and justify their existence. Btw. My current reroute via the LNER service from Leeds also has better and cheaper food.",

It was recommended that we should continue past the overhead damage and then catch the train on the southbound line and could apply for a refund using the Avanti delay repay. \nFirstly, the Avanti delay repay is incredibly difficult if you haven't booked through Avanti, The form is too tiny to attach anything and the A4 page is meant to be folded into an envelope to be sent. When I contacted Avanti to state that the form wasn't usable, they asked for the details. I sent the relevant details on and they said there was insufficient information to provide me a refund. \nI'd avoid booking with Avanti if at all possible.

While peak times Manchester-London are clearly stated, the off-peak times London-Manchester aren't documented, you have to try every ticket time shown and wait for the booking to fail at the payment step. Virgin Trains had a peak time leaving London after 5PM, it looks like Avanti have changed it to 3:30PM. Awful. I can fly to the USA and back for less than a peak time train ticket.

The cheque was issued to me, but my name was misspelled and therefore could not be banked. Despite multiple enquiries about getting the cheque reissued (and waiting for up to an hour to speak to someone) it's now November and I'm still yet to receive the compensation cheque.

The trains, due to a drastic cut in service frequency are seriously overloaded, carriages designed for 70 passengers are loaded to double that with standing passengers. A few years back a Pendolino Train operated by Virgin Trains derailed at Grayrigg the train was praised for its build quality in saving lives, it was also not full, there were empty seats, the staff were happy in there jobs. Now the trains are the same Pendolinos but are packed with double the intended passengers, the staff are disheartened and reduced in numbers. Should there god forbid be another incident involving a derailment especially at speed the outcome is very likely to be far more serious!\nIt is illegal for a bus or coach to be driven on the road with more passengers than allowed, one person is responsible for ensuring that does not happen and that\u2019s the driver, he also has a legal duty for the care and safety of his passengers, where are the laws for trains? Who is responsible? The train driver sits in a sealed lockable compartment sometimes he has cctv showing the interior of the carriages, the guard or train manager is unable to get through the train due to overcrowding and probably for fear of there own safety, be concerned because no one has any consideration for your safety! The Health and Safety Executive need to take responsibility, the Rail Unions need to take some action to safeguard its members as well but more importantly the whole future of railways, all the ingredients are there for one historic disaster!",

The inability to book more than a few days in advance at weekends, the number of cancellations and horrendous overcrowding of the trains mean that I no longer use the company and will not until the franchise has changed.

They even printed the ticket with the original departure time displayed. It still states that time on the website, in my journeys as well. Despite all the evidence that\u2014short of mind reading\u2014I had no way of knowing that the train was going to leave 20 minute earlier I was denied compensation.\n\n\"I regret to inform you however that this is not something that we offer compensation for as the journey had been changed 10 days after the booking had been made and you should have been notified by email, this is an automatic process for any change in timetable. \" \n\nWhat a joke. This journey already had to be rebooked once due to strike action, and, as their online system insisted on charging me full ticket price when I tried to change my dates, instead of just the difference, I wasted an hour on the phone sorting that out as well. Seriously incompetent service.\n\nTheir bike policy in general is ridiculous too, massive long distance trains to Scotland with only 4 spaces in total available, makes life really unnecessarily complicated.",

        "review_text": "I wish I could leave zero stars. I am switching from Avanti trains to coach travel because I am so sick of journeys with Avanti. It's not just the reduced services, particularly from Liverpool to London, which is my route. Even when I can find a train, it's always uncomfortable, including trips when I have splashed out on a first class ticket hoping for a bit of comfort (now a complete waste of money). \nThe interiors have been reconfigured since Virgin's days, presumably to cram in more seats and get more money per journey. This might be good for shareholders in the short term (probably not long term because of the effect on customer satisfaction) if it has increased turnover, or even profit. But it is, short and long term, horrible for the customers. It is uncomfortable to be always crammed in with too many people in a single compartment, especially when there are quieter carriages. In a pandemic (Covid is still very much an issue), it is unhealthy. The west coast computer booking system needs to be overridden to spread travellers through the train (pandemic or not), instead of shoving all booked customers into as few coaches as possible, while leaving other compartments empty, as was the case on the 11.47am Liverpool-Euston on Monday. On a recent first class ticket trip, I moved into a quieter compartment that was not first class to find more air and space, and to get away from a man sitting close to me and coughing all over me. I consider that to have been a criminal assault on me by Avanti, which is responsible for my health and safety on the journey. On one of my first journeys on Avanti some years ago, the train stopped at Runcorn and disgorged its contents (it was summer...lots of holidaymakers with luggage), leaving all customers on the platform to wait for the next (extremely crowded) train 20 minutes later to get to Lime Street. No explanation was given. I asked the driver and he said the train had to head back to Euston because it was running late for another  journey...never mind the customers on that earlier train. I should have known then that Avanti would always treat its customers with complete contempt. Even the staff don't like the company, judging by the responses I have had from staff members when inquiring about Avanti's policies. I honestly do not know how the staff continue to behave with decency and respect towards customers. It is more than can be said for Avanti's senior staff. Avanti should be stripped of the West Coast contract. It is a disgraceful service. I am really sick of being treated like rubbish by this company. I never thought I would say it, but Avanti is worse than Virgin.",

We were unable to travel because of the rail strike on August 13. I requested a refund. Actually requesting a refund was a tortuous process because of having booked 4 single tickets, I had to make separate applications for refunds. On October 10 (nearly two months after the travel date) I received two emails from Avanti saying I had been refunded. However I only received a refund for one of the tickets. I contacted so called customer service and had a reply from Nasima saying I had been refunded. When I queried this I was told it could take 5-10 days to receive the funds. I in fact had had the refund mentioned in the email the following day. I replied to Nasima asking where the rest of my money was and to date I have not received any further response from Avanti. I have lodged a complaint with Avanti.",

I came back from Ireland via Cairnryan and Glasgow back in August and everything was fine until we got to Scotland's biggest city.\n\nThe train was cancelled and people were left relying on the last one for London.  The queues were out of the station and the train was hence late leaving.  There were at least four delays en route, a dubious trackside fire, a person taken ill on the train, on-board computer not working and being held up by late-night freight traffic which meant a diversion into engineering works with a speed limit of 20mph.  In all a perfect example of Murphy's Law.\n \nWe eventually arrived in Euston 3.5 hours late at 2am only to be greeted by a bunch of muppets lined up in case we ventured into other parts of the station.  The whole journey from Portadown took about 17 hours.  I only went this way as it was said to be slightly quicker than the other routes.\n\nThe only good thing about it was I got a full refund, which saved the company from getting 1 star, although that took longer than advertised to be settled.\n\nTalk about a hellish nightmare I thought I was travelling through Kafkaville.",

It\u2019s now the norm for the seat reservation system to be down, or train gets declassified due to the regular train cancellations. And we now have to accept that weekend timetables and tickets, are rarely available until days before travel (probably to minimise claims for the all the cancellations)!\nThis is totally unacceptable. How on earth can you plan a trip and book other activities when you\u2019re not even sure if you\u2019ll get there. And getting back is yet another nightmare!\nThe government needs to step in and sort out this mess.

        "review_text": "Booked a return ticket from Carlisle to Euston with reserved seating. Both journeys were \u201ccancelled\u201d with trains running 20 minutes before. I suspect they sold tickets for multiple trains and then just cancelled random ones so all the passengers were crammed into one train. We therefore had no seat reservation in the one that actually ran and had to stand most of the way. Their customer service is appalling and I wish I could give a negative rating. Like another reviewer said, I think I\u2019d rather walk than give this company another penny!!",

Surely all seats must have a power socket in this day and age. Luckily as my journey progressed a table became available so I could charge my devices and use my laptop for work. The train was not the cleanest, there was a light fitting in my carriage showing cables hanging out, the announcement speakers were too loud. Use if you must but Liner and Luma are so much better,and much more modern.",

        "review_text": "Avanti West Coast is the most convenient way for me to travel to see family; unfortunately, I begrudge having to use their service.\n\nAvailability of advance tickets seems to be a particular problem. Even in pre-pandemic times, they would release advance tickets very late, however, the situation right now is just awful. Last month, advance tickets for my journey on 24th September only became available on 21st September. I booked my ticket within an hour of receiving the ticket alert yet I had to pay nearly \u00a370 for a journey that would normally cost \u00a335-40.\n\nTrains are generally dirty with smelly toilets, are poorly maintained (noisy brakes, loud bangs when air conditioning switches on/off), seat reservations are often cancelled, wifi is terrible, and trains often run late for no apparent reason (in August, both my outward and return trains were nearly 30 minutes late arriving). I usually travel Standard Premium however the at-seat order service (which Avanti advertise as a perk of Standard Premium) never works.\n\nI've submitted several complaints over the past year relating to on-train experience and problems encountered when booking tickets. On almost every occasion, the customer service advisor failed to read the complaint properly and gave either an incomplete or unrelated response.\n\nLet's see if Avanti can improve their service during this six month extension. Otherwise, I'd be happy to see the back of them.",

        "review_text": "I booked a one way journey to return home to Chester after a trip to London only for this direct service to be cancelled. I therefore decided that as I had to change I would get an earlier train as the email I received stated that I could get the next available Avanti west coast service, I arrived at the station with the intention of getting the 11:10 service and changing at Crewe to then change onward to Chester, I visited the ticket office to check this only to be told I could only get the train before or after my original one which I think is unacceptable as this would mean I would return home later than my original train due to the change despite the fact that I\u2019d paid for a direct service with a reserved seat. Because of this I had no choice but to pay a \u00a333.40 excess in order to board the 11:10 train and that my reserved seat couldn\u2019t be transferred and that many available seats would be available on the train something which was incorrect as when I boarded the train only 5 minutes after the platform was announced on the screen there was only a handful of available seats which were all taken meaning I had no choice but to sit in the doorway of a corridor between carriages. To pay a total of \u00a368.60 and in return have my direct train cancelled, be given incorrect/misleading information, be spoken to rudely by both the information booth and ticket office, have no choice but to sit on the floor for my whole journey, have to change despite paying for a direct service, having to wait 45 minutes for my connecting change, I think this is absolutely unacceptable service and I would advise absolutely any other travel arrangements than using this awful company",

As others have said I\u2019d give zero stars if I could.\nThis is only way I have of getting to Colwyn bay as I don\u2019t drive and there are no coaches that stop there.\nA lot of the staff working on the trains are the ones that worked for Virgin and I\u2019m not suprised they look miserable at times as I can\u2019t imagine what there working condition are like given the way they treat passengers.

        "review_text": "My husband and I booked seats back in August for return trip from Chester to London this week. I deliberately chose direct trains as we are both elderly and wanted to minimise carrying luggage. A few days before we had an email to say that the timetable had changed and I should make sure this hadn't affected my journey. The outward train now required us to change at Crewe. It made things more difficult as we had to carry our luggage and no longer had seat reservations but we managed. Our return train was cancelled. I went to the ticket office to see if I could reserve seats on the next train. A very rude woman insisted that the train wasn't cancelled but was running as far as Crewe and that I should run (!) to get it right away as it was leaving in 5 minutes. I pointed out that this was not our original train but a Preston train leaving at the same time.   She kept repeating that it was my train and I had to get it because it was the only train on which my ticket was valid. I pointed out that the email from Avanti had said I could get the train before or after if my original train was changed, which it had been, since there was clearly no longer a 16.10 direct train to Chester showing on the board. She talked to me slowly and loudly as though the problem was that I was incapable of understanding - I may be old but I'm not stupid. Eventually she agreed to book me on the next train, which proved to be impossible for reasons unclear to her, so her advice was to go for that one and hope we could get seats. Fortunately we did. I want to stress that the train crews on both journeys were excellent but the Avanti booking system and support were a complete shambles.",

I booked on the avanti website, so she had not excuse for the company not notifying me of the cancellations.  I have a disability so it's a HUGE problem not to have a seat allocation in advance.  \nI travel between MAN-EUS often for work and now they won't give me cash refunds for my future bookings - I don't want an e-voucher.  One trip has cost me 180GBP return but it seems they are changing their ticket types to advance to prevent having to provide refunds.  Normally this would be a flexible/refundable ticket at this price.\nIt seems they don't care about the customer experience and are solely focused on revenue/income protection.  I am so upset with this company, they've left me out of pocket. Avanti - you need to sort this mess out ASAP.  \nI just hope the ombudsman helps me.",

Today they claim they have cancelled the service. I can get a refund or spend an extra hour traveling - with three changes and no direct service. They blame their own employees. Frankly, I using the same route than I have for the last forty years and the service has never been so absent. Even during lockdown the service was superior. They must be stripped of the franchise asap. They aren't deserved of the contract. The management are an absolute \" shower\"",

I keep claiming ticket refunds,it seems impossible to arrive to my destination on time. \n\nI pay for a direct train from euston to manchester weekly and when it gets cancelled  i have to take the next train hence the seat reservation is lost. It also takes 1 hour extra as it is not direct anymore.\n\nFor 200\u00a3 return ticket i would expect much better service",

The poor station staff were getting the brunt of the frustration as there were hundreds of people in the same situation, I'm surprised the staff showed up knowing what was coming for them!\n\nI was due to leave this weekend, but the tickets hadn't went on sale, I signed up for a notification of when they'd go on sale and I went on today, 2 days before travel, the tickets were on sale and again I hadn't received an email notification! Even more annoying was there were no cheaper advance tickets available, only regular single tickets!

The trains are often crowded and booking a seat doesn't guarantee you get a seat, so many occasions where the seat has been double booked. Sort out your WiFi! Positives is the train time between Manchester and London, 2 hours is great, and their train staff are great normally!",

Luckily I had arrived with plenty of time so could just make the train, but if I had been elderly or with children I would have missed it, and I'm sure Avanti would blame me. For the return journey, nobody was on hand to open the bike store in the end carriage so I had to bang on the drivers window. The whole process is embarrassing and feels like rail travel has gone back to the 1970s. The trains are smelly and dated and the staff clearly have no pride in their work, they are all very downbeat and seem keen to catch you out or make you feel at fault. I am always somewhat anxious when travelling with Avanti because it seems so many things can (and do) go wrong.",

        "review_text": "I travel regularly from Manchester to London and the Avanti service just gets worse every time. I never understood how the Government could award a contract that made the service more expensive for the public. Since that award, it has been all down hill in my view. The service is more expensive, less reliable and less customer friendly than Virgin (ie dirty trains, stressed and unhelpful staff, online booking issues, train cancellations, etc.)\n\nRecently, my partner and I needed to book a trip to London, but there were no advance tickets available just 4 weeks before travel. On a whim, I looked at going via Leeds and using the LNER line. What a revelation. LNER had trains available, the online booking process was simple and it was significantly cheaper than Avanti West Coast. Whilst it will take us well over 3 hours via this route, it will be cheaper overall (how should that be possible?!) and, based on LNER reviews, I am hopeful that it will be a pleasant journey. \n\nTo our Government: please do something positive for the people you serve, sack Avanti West Coast and replace it with a competent operator.  Stop blaming drivers for not wanting to use their free time to shore up the company. How many of us would happily work regular weekends to keep a company going, and how would we feel if we decided to spend the weekend with our family or friends and had that labelled as \"unofficial strike action\"?  Employees are not slaves. Customers are not cash machines. Stop defending a failed monopoly and actually listen to the market that you are allegedly so fond of.",

I was not provided with any forward journey information and there were no staff available at any point during the 2hr journey to ask. When I initially asked what the situation was when arriving at Carlisle as I was stranded, it was suggested I 'get a bus in town'. I find this quite shocking as a woman in an unfamiliar town and travelling alone at night. \nTo the staff members credit, when I questioned this advice they arranged a taxi for me.

        "review_text": "I travel from Birmingham to London every few weeks to see my partner, going to London on the Friday and returning on the Sunday. I have been doing this for a while and have never had any real issues until recently.\n\nThe issues started a few months back when the seat reservations frequently wouldn't work. Seats would either not say whether they were reserved or not, or all seats said reserved from Edinburgh which is obviously incorrect. This caused me problems as I would often find someone in my seat and on a few occassions I couldn't get them to move. This may not seem like a huge issue, but I make sure I prebook my seat as I have luggage and want to be able to settle during my journey. When someone is in my reserved seat and I have to find another random seat, it means I sometimes then get asked to move midway through my journey or spend the whole journey not being able to fully relax or concentrate on whatever I'm doing because I'm trying to stay aware in case I am in someone's seat, which isn't ideal especially if I am trying to do some work on the train. My partner also frequently has the same issue with seat reservations.\n\nLast time I travelled, as well as the usual seat reservation issues on the way down, I also had a problem coming back because when I came to travel I realised my booked train was not showing on the board. This was really quite a worry as I needed to get home to be able to go to work the next day and I didn't know what was going on. I did manage to get booked onto another train by going to the ticket desk, but I ended up arriving an hour later than I should have which was not ideal when I needed to be up early the next day and was relying on people to pick me up at the station when I arrived. I was told it was because the timetable had changed, but I had no communication about this whatsoever and had only booked my ticket a week or two in advance.\n\nToday I have tried to book a ticket for the coming weekend, but I can't because the timetable hasn't been confirmed yet. The day I am trying to book for is less than a week away, so I really would expect it to be confirmed by now. I have plans for the weekend so I really need to know what time I will be able to get there (or if I can even get there at all) so that I can confirm these plans. I'm also concerned that the longer I have to wait for the timetable, the more expensive my ticket is likely to be.\n\nNever used to have any issues with Avanti so not sure why things seem to keep going wrong for me lately. Hoping things improve soon.\n\nOh and the at seat food/drink ordering never works, always just says \"not available at the moment\"...",

At Crewe rail station, however, most trains are cancelled or delayed, including ours. Pathetic service. Update, we are currently on a train to Wilmslow where we have to change for Manchester Airport. Don't know if we will be in time to make our connection. Shocking service! Update, We arrived at Winslow 20 minutes late and just missed the connection to Manchester Airport. The next train is due an hour later! We decided to take a taxi which added \u00a316 to our travel costs, but got us to the airport in 3 minutes. Update, On the return journey, my wife and I caught the train to Wilmslow, only to find that the connection to Crewe had been cancelled due to \"insufficient staff.\" Update, When we finally got on a train, it was completely packed, with no windows, on a red hot day! Avanti and Northern line are incredibly bad and have no concern for their passengers. The whole experience was traumatic and very upsetting, especially on such an important day for our son and for us.",

When I went to collect my tickets and new reserved seats for the train I was re-booked on after my train was cancelled, I was given tickets to my old (now non-existent) train in my old reserved seats. This meant that the elderly people I was helping to get seats together ended up being scattered across the trains and carriages (when we had originally had 4 seats together) which made travelling an absolute nightmare. We had no method of proving that we had new reserved seats on the new scheduled train as I was promised by customer service we would. \n\nThis ended up causing a lot of distress, fear and a panic attack among the group of seniors I was accompanying. \n\nWould not recommend.",

Mark was very approachable and so helpful when we were confused about what train we could get on with our ticket !! On board the train we sat close to the managers station - from here we could see how knowledgeable he is and how dedicated he is to his job.

I have only discovered by chance as I didn't even get an email confirmation but when I looked to check the details on my phone I noticed the 3rd and 1st legs were just showing cancelled. It is so difficult for me to get there to begin with and I am unable to get there by National Express, Mega bus or Flix Bus.  Looking likely my trip may have to be cancelled.  Even if I can find alternative tickets looking at the next few days which you can book at the moment they are substantially more expensive than my original booking so no doubt my dates will be the same when I can book next week. As a 17 year reliant on public transport this is upsetting and annoyed is not the word!",

While we were on our way to the Windermere station, we realized we could not find our later train to Edinburgh on any of the time tables. It had been cancelled with no notification or follow up or anything. We managed to find a train from Oxenholme to Edinburgh with a stop in Glasgow. The train was 20 minutes delayed with no explanation. While we were told the train was going to be busy, it was packed beyond belief (if only they hadn't cancelled a bunch of other trains...). Most coaches were entirely full when they arrived at the station and many people had to stand in the aisles for multiple hours. The icing on the cake was it was a heatwave, and we were packed like sardines in a metal tube with little to no airconditioning, suffering for hours straight. \n\nIn short: Avanti likes to cancel trains at the last minute with no notice, even when you do get on a train, it is a hellish experience. I sympathize with all the Avanti workers who are doing their best in these times but I think the higher ups at Avanti need to change their priorities: supporting their workers so they don't need to strike, and running more trains (or at least all the trains they had scheduled).\n\nI'll be avoiding Avanti at all costs in the future.",

It was the hottest day of the year (33 degrees) Cramped, NO air con, and this was blamed on it being to hot for it to work properly (Countries like Kuwait cope where it gets far hotter). The wi fi was not working (both ways), Then in the middle of nowhere, it stopped for 35 mins because the tracks ahead were to hot. I was literally covered in sweat and it was very, very, very uncomfortable. Its not cheap ( a standard single costs more than taking a car) but it was an abysmal experience.

        "review_text": "Avanti have run the previously excellent Virgin First Class service into the ground, IMO. \n\nAvanti First Class is a seriously expensive product, yet the amount of accommodation on Pendolinos is often less than half what it was under Virgin. On one occasion, it was nothing more than the few seats next to the kitchen, with the rest of the First Class carriages being classified as Standard Premium (I assume to grab additional on-train revenue from passengers paying an at-seat supplement). \n\nThe last train I caught from Manchester to London was declassified around Macclesfield. Ahead of that, orders were taken in First Class for breakfast - but the breakfast never arrived! Nor did anything else; not even a bottle of water. Incredibly, there was no announcement to say the promised breakfast would not be delivered.\n\nI sat in the carriage next to the kitchen and there was no shortage of staff. There were no passengers standing in First Class, either in the carriages or the vestibules. And, even if the policy is to suspend service when a train is declassified, there can be no excuse at all for not letting passengers know that.\n\nWhat I experienced, was, by any standard, a shockingly bad way to treat those who bought tickets on the basis that a promised level of service will be provided.\n\nIf this wasn't bad enough, it was more or less the same on my return journey. A kitchen full of staff, who didn't deliver any service at all in First Class.\n\nAvanti are running a monopoly rail service from Manchester. I think it's time for the Department of Transport to look at how they are doing that.",

We ordered food to our seats the app accepted the  order and took payment but nothing came.

I agree with many of the other 1* reviews recently posted here. The trains are filthy - I don\u2019t think the toilets or carpets are regularly cleaned. I find this amazing as we are coming out of a pandemic\u2026 The cancellations at short notice and long delays are already very frustrating on a daily basis as a commuter, and the fact that the Avanti staff also have no idea what train is coming when is just ridiculous. The price of tickets has risen astronomically for service that\u2019s worse than ever. Their customer service and IT is also not fit for purpose. The app doesn\u2019t work, getting hold of someone to make a complaint or resolve a problem is impossible. Whether or not you like Richard Branson, Virgin Trains West Coast ran an excellent service. It\u2019s long been my opinion that Trenitalia took over to run it into the ground and take off with the profit, no doubt with members of our lovely government pocketing a share. I feel sorry for Avanti staff, who are certainly going to get the worst deal of all.",

The Accessible toilet next to the 'Quiet Zone' was....out of use! Not acceptable. The next toilet along was passable, not the usual urine-soaked stinking nightmare of days gone by. The \"free WiFi\" is a joke. I can't even play a YouTube video, let alone do any gaming! Although the Quiet Zone was quiet, the signage needs to be stronger, to tell people to basically sit down and shut up. For the very high cost of my ticket, I expect better.\nOn my return journey, however, the train was notably cleaner, better appointed. The Quiet Zone rules are still not firmly enforced though. I don't know why people can't just sit down and shut up when travelling. The return journey was certainly better, but the cost of the ticket still does not represent value for money.",

When I got on the train someone was sat in my seat. Politely asked them to move but they said the train had been declassified. Spoke to a member of staff on the train who told me there was nothing they could do, so I had to stand up for the whole journey.

The timetables covered several days and were incredibly  difficult to read. My train was listed as several minutes later than advertised so I was likely to miss my connection. But when I arrived at the station my train was cancelled. I got on a later train which was packed with people standing and I was travelling with three children... I missed my connection. I had extreme difficulty in getting a refund- their website is chaotic, confusing and contradictory. Yesterday, the same chaos when I tried to claim a refund for a cancelled train due to the strike. I took me about 6 goes to claim on my phone- impossible to claim on my laptop. Then my claim was rejected because Avanti replied that I had \"booked through a third party retailer\" - this is despite the journey and ticket being listed and downloadable from my account on the Avanti website! I responded and threatened contacting my MP- then my refund was successful- after a couple of hours of time and effort... disgraceful!!!!",

Eventually after numerous times asking her what to do she says we could drag all our luggage, two young children and pram to our reserved seats which was 2 carriages away and I couldn't leave my valuables. I then says I would be making a complaint. This is the worst bit the manager then came over and took a picture of my daughter lying down and the luggage. I then asked why she was taking a photo and if I could see it. She says she was taking a photo of the luggage to show the manager ( why I don't know) and my child wasn't in the photo. I then asked if I could see the photos and there was my little girl lying there in the photo on the managers phone her name was \u2018Marie Claire\u2019. She refused to delete the photo. I have never experienced customer service like this in my life. Made an official complaint and the company doesn't seem to care. Would never use the service again!!!!!!! Stay well clear.",

Today, the train manager 'Claire-Marie' was extremely rude to me, and when I gave her my ticket, she started scrolling through my phone's screenshots to find the second half of my journey. She could have just asked, and I would have shown it to her. Extremely rude and an unprofessional service. Additionally, she spoke in a very unpleasant and condascending tone, which was wholly unnecessary, as I am just quietly trying to get about my day. \nTrains are filthy and overheated, and the toilets stink. Food is overpriced, and the website and wifi is impossible to use.\nAnd this doesn't even mention the cancellations, which have wreaked havoc on my life time and time again.\nThe British public and international travelers deserve far better for the extortionate price charged.",

I booked the same details in person the following day, I was served by a young lady called 'Bex' at the ticket office in Glasgow Central who went over and above what I expected a staff member to do. She was so helpful, and friendly. Although she couldn't get us all sitting together she got me a reservation in the same coach. I would appreciate it if she could be thanked by an Avanti Manager for her service and efficiency.\nYours sincerely Mr. D.Hammond",

I finally got through to a human on customer service who said it is not my job and you only set up a business account electronically  - I have a creditcard that I pay for tickets but want my engineers to be able to pick the ticket up themselves - do you think I can find this out NO they do not even reply.",

        "review_text": "Avanti west coast is just the WORST rail company I\u2019ve ever seen, and I am definitely being fair. Here are the reasons.\n\n1. Before and during the pandemic, we always traveled back from London Euston to north wales with a much more reasonable price (at that time trains were operated by Virgin). You sometimes could get first-class tickets with a very decent price. This has completely changed since those shi-8heads decided to let AWC to replace Virgin. Prices are always ridiculously high, with the same price from London Euston to Manchester, I can fly to most European countries with returned flight tickets.\n\n2. Trains are always either delayed or cancelled and there won\u2019t be any notification until the last minute. Want a refund? Congrats you will need to fill in a 100-page form to claim compensation and even then they might reject your request from time to time. \n3. The train tickets that we used to buy now become unavailable to buy for the next 12 weeks. Only first-class tickets are available and this situation has last for more than a month. Are you telling me that all tickets are sold out for the next rolling 12 weeks???\n4. Their customer service line takes forever to call through. Any enquiry? Wait for 40 mins before someone can talk to you.\n\nHonestly I HATE HATE HATE AWC. Please lose your bid and f-off in a few years when your contract finishes.",

        "review_text": "Before the pandemic I used Virgin Trains Stockport to Euston regularly.\n\nThey weren't perfect. But compared with Avanti ..! Let me begin;\n\n1. the Avanti website is dreadful; having asked for travel times it doesn't display the range of trains across one's preferred time before it has asked you for other details of your trip; so one can't quickly get an overview of cheaper times to travel; given that the route is over used Avanti thereby do not encourage filling off-peak services; and beyond that it has been organised by amateurs compared with the userfriendliness of Virgin; even the Avanti staff at Stockport admit that everyone complains ot them about the uselessness of the Web site.\n2. There is no warning on the Avant website that trains not booked directly with Avanti canNOT be changed at departure station; why not?\n3. on the day I travelled, my train was delayed by an hour out of Euston. On the down train in the morning the train from Stockport was filthy. On the way back it was dirty.\n4. Today I just wanted to find train times. It wouldn't supply them because it said all trains booked out. This was a lie. Rail strikes are planned on the days conserved. The website didn't say this was the reason. The Trainline website did. This smells of understaffing.\n\nThe overall impression is that Avanti just don't care (unlike Virgin). I suspect this is because the government are already scheduling the end of franchising so why should they? \n\nSo what we have is a relatively new replacement for the west coast mainline franchise which knows its going to be replaced and sees no point in improving any aspects of its services which are worse than Virgin. \"Another fine mess\" of rail reorganisation!\n\nI can suggest nothing to ameliorate this unfortunate situation other than to note the financial involvement of TrenItalia displayed on the front and back of each train and tell the Italian rail company thinking its got a good investment in this W Coast mainline. It hasn't and never will have unless things change dramatically. In Italy, I found Trenitalia on the other hand to be good, but that isn't much help other than to indicate that where there's a will there's a way!\n\nSad very very sad when a good service declines like this.",

There are a few things that stand out as being sub par. Cleanliness is dreadful. I found no material difference in comfort between standard and first class seats  and the food portions ridiculously small and the quality below the standard offered by rivals (first class). BTW there is no first class lounge for Avanti customers at Waverly, be aware of this. \n I've had one or two trains cancelled, and they arranged connections,  which happens but what I hate is having to deal with Avanti customer service- 70 + mins left hanging on a phone and they just dropped the line. I  fly now or use the rival service to london, anything to avoid using  them. That says it all really.",

        "review_text": "Some absolute jobsworth took great pleasure in closing the gate on us when the train was sat there with the doors open, all because of a ridiculous rule where they close boarding two full minutes before the train goes. Does it say this rule on the ticket or on the board at Euston? Of course not. \n\nThis was on the jubilee bank holiday as well, he could have easily let us on but no, he\u2019d rather mess up our and four other peoples travel plans because they didn\u2019t know about a rule that isn\u2019t advertised anywhere you\u2019d expect it to be. He is pathetic man working for a pathetic company. You could tell he didn\u2019t want to help us or the other passengers there, it was \u201cnot his problem\u201d. He said we\u2019d need to buy another ticket, which was also wrong as we had an off peak return, so had a choice of trains, which we found out from the Euston help desk I.e. the only help was from someone not working for Avanti\u2026\n\nIf he\u2019d let us on I could be writing a positive review but that would be too easy and obvious for a company and employees as small minded and anti-customer as Avanti. \n\nLiterally hundreds of people a week will get caught by this rule and the only reason I can see for it existing is that it forces customers to buy new train tickets at extortionate prices. Do you know why it isn\u2019t to make the trains leave and arrive on time? Because they almost never do and most other train services don\u2019t do this and run far better.\n\nFinally we get on the next train and the circus of awfulness continues: the carriage smells; overhead storage is about 5 inches tall so you can\u2019t fit anything up there; coffee cup in the net behind the seat (started at Euston so was missed by cleaning); gum in the fabric of the seats; windows are small so feels cramped.\n\nYou win Avanti, I\u2019ll tell anyone I ever can to avoid using you and will now drive the route I normally take the train for, to avoid your awful services. \n\nScrew this company, it cannot shut down soon enough.",

The fabric of the seats themselves looked as though they were never cleaned. There were sticky blobs _ maybe chewing gum or something like it - on a few of the seats. And the toilets, never very good even when these Pendolino trains were new, were pretty stinky even from a distance. For the exhorbitant price of the journey I was disgusted. I've resolved to use West Midlands Trains for the same journey in future. There are more stops and more changes, so it takes twice as long but on the upside it's cheaper and West Midlands do seem to clean their carriages occasionally. At least you don't feel like you need a shower when you get to your destination. Or I could just drive - about the same cost even with diesel at about \u00a32 a litre.",

Even Virgin weren't this bad.\n\nI tried ringing to complain, but the wait was up to 30-40 minutes. I can't be bothered to try any other avenue for complaint, as I have no doubt it will be ignored after I have been fed some meaningless platitudes.\n\nAvanti west coast are a dreadful company. Their trains from Liverpool Limestreet to London Euston are regularly delayed or cancelled. This is according to station staff at Limestreet. They are also impossible to get hold of on the phone, and their tickets are overpriced compared to virgin. \n\nDo not take an avanti train on a weekend from Liverpool limestreet to London Euston.

It was given in a standard difficult-to-recycle coffee cup (that will probably end up in landfill*) with a fully enclosed plastic lid. The salesperson put it in a paper bag. I said I didn't need a paper bag. He said I have to take it. I asked why. He said I might drop it. Umm okay, that's what the lid is for?\n\nThere is an environmental crisis going on caused by waste culture and stuff like this just pisses me off. Companies should be reducing unnecessary waste, not increasing it - we are going the wrong way while approaching planetary tipping points with polluted water, soil and air. I should not be forced to take a paper bag that I don't need and serves no purpose whatsoever.\n\n*Guardian: Why Britain\u2019s 2.5 billion paper coffee cups are an eco disaster",

        "review_text": "Summary -Arrived in time with Advanced ticket via Trainline with seat F61 booked on 19th May for the18.03 train to Liverpool. Unfortunately it was cancelled. However, no information on procedures what to do. Went to ticket office - no interest really but informed my ticket would be accepted for 19.07 train. Boarded this train at 19.15 with great difficulty (I am 82 years old, still mobile but not as fast as the customers stampeding to the now 'under capacity' train). There were no seats and unfortunately I had to stand all the way from Euston to Runcorn, when I finally got a seat. (for about 20 minutes I sat on the floor between carriages). The next day I contacted, Trainline, who were clear that as Ticket vendors, they could not help me to either complain or make a modest claim for the inconvenience and discomfort and I should contact the trainline directly. This I did and again found it impossible to penetrate the complexities of registering                     with Avantiwestcoast and even making a complaint. It was as if the procedures were designed to deliberately make one fed-up with wasting time and going down repeated blind alleys, that one would give up. Which of course was what I finally did by diverting to a website that does understand about presenting comments and displeasure.  I am not angry about a claim, nor the cancellation but I am annoyed at not being able to make a criticism directly to a rail service, who have taken payment for a service and have inefficiently not delivered it!  How can one support such a service?",

The passenger in question was heavily drinking on the train, which I thought staff would have intervened with but I digress. This double booking resulted in an excessive and unsafe number of people, a very Covid unsafe number and a certain health risk. \n\nAppalling, sickening and the company should be ashamed it put people in this position.\n\nMy partner has sciatica which has paralyzed her in the past, and I was standing/walking for 12 hours prior to this journey. My feet had bloody blisters and having to stand only worsened this.\n\nHaving recently dealt with a bereavement this is not what I needed, and once again the company completely failed in its service and covenants to the customers. In trying to find a ticket attendant to ensure what the passenger said was true, none could be found, so the trains were poorly staffed on top of everything else.",

What absolute joke their first class service has become since I last used it earlier in the year. I boarded 10:08am from Edinburgh expecting to have nice breakfast as I have always had in the past as regular customer on this route. To my surprise I was informed there was virtually nothing left except possibly very small portion scrambled eggs and salmon and forget toast etc as that was no go even though Carlisle was next stop after Edinburgh. Customer service team informed me they didn\u2019t have enough food on board. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough on my return journey (15:41) we were served no food at all. Coffee came followed by alcoholic drinks which was red wine served from large plastic soft drink bottle which was unbelievable. Customer server then disappeared into preparation area  which we all thought he was getting menus to ask us what food we would like to order. He was no show for rest of journey. This is clearly not the service I expect when travelling with Avanti. I\u2019ve raised complaint with customer resolution and it will be interesting to see if they take my concern seriously or just ignore it",

I proceed to purchase the railcard, then clicked the link taking me to Avanti's site to purchase the tickets.\n\nDespite doing the search with \"Railcard\" selected, at some point during the purchasing process, this was removed and I ended up paying for tickets that did not use a Railcard (about \u00a348 more!) but did not see this until the final summary was displayed AFTER payment was completed. I should have noticed the larger than expected price, but in getting everything booked and coordinating it with another booking, I missed this assuming that my original selection was still being applied (WARNING TO OTHERS: double check what is selected before paying!)\n\nI would like to get this changed, either by crediting the overcharge, or by refunding and repurchasing, but there was no telephone number I could find to call, and the only contact is through email with a response stating that you will look into it within 28 days! That would be about when the trip was to occur. I was hoping that I would be contacted sooner, but that is not the case.\n\nI'm hoping that someone will get in touch with me, so I don't have to see if this can be dealt with at the station on the day of the trip. I would be willing to accept a free upgrade in exchange for the refund, but we'll see how this goes. Stay tuned!",

I was unable to move at all with a person next to me. \nComing back was even worse - jam packed - the aisles are so narrow I literally had backsides in my face as people tried to board and sit down at stops. A rucksack knocked my glasses off and every time someone passed in the aisle they knocked my arm off the armrest. \nThen to top it all I had some clown ranting at me telling me I was on the wrong train and to get out of his seat. My ticket clearly stated I was in the right seat on the right train - his ticket had slightly different time on it. This went on for about 10mins until he went away as other passengers backed me up.\nAbout \u00a395 each way standard class. Is pure greed to get as many seats in a coach as possible. The people that need to be moaned at are the accountants and CEO's and they will never read this. Yes staff polite but not around when getting ranted at so no use to me. If there was an emergency the narrow aisles would cause multiple deaths, I cannot believe it is legal.

This obstruction is typical of everything you try to access on their website\n  The train carriages are always red hot.  Our journey last night was particularly uncomfortable.  Virgin controlled carriage heat properly.\n  They have done nothing to improve anything since they took over the route.\n   When I tried to complain on their website I was told to 'Please enter proper characters'  with no highlighting to indicate any errors (there are no obvious errors in my message) . . . obviously my complaint couldn't be sent because of this . .

We overheard several disputes between people and as others have said the staff did not intervene merely telling people over the intercom to sit where they could.\nReturned to Liverpool on Thursday 14th April this time travelling first class. This is when we noticed a big difference with previous first class journeys on Virgin. There was nothing special about it unless uou consider the indifferent food. Not worth the huge increase in fare. Others who are regular rail travellers will know better than me but I think the way these contracts are awarded is flawed. Once a company has obtained the contract they can basically  do as they like so there is no competition. These contracts should be shared between several companies and obviously the one who delivers the best service will get the most customers. Surely this is how market competition works otherwise we just continually get British Rail with different names.",

Travelled from London to Birmingham for a day and didn't expect so much adventure being on the train. On the way there, the train was delayed by 15 mins, which was fine until I realised the reserved seats were taken because they had combined THREE scheduled trains for unknown reason. My partner and I were lucky enough to find empty seats for our 90 mins ride. On the way back, we didn't have as much luck. On a Sunday afternoon, the train was delayed again by 15 mins because the crews were late - the least confusing part, thereby cancelling the scheduled train instead of putting on an extra one to cover their own mistake. If they could be bothered to do their research for 5 mins, they'd realise there was a huge event on in Birmingham. Therefore, putting extra trains for the PAYING customers would make sense. BUT, because providing great services isn't their priority, many of us, including myself, had to be squeezed into the cafe carriage, as there were no seats available, even though I had seats reserved. The mere fact that I got on the train was a miracle because who knows when the next one will come!! Since there were so many of us in the cafe carriage, the cafe worker decided to shut down the cafe, so NOBODY could buy food or drinks on this horrendous ride. We had no choice but to sit on the FLOOR in the cafe carriage as the ride was 90 mins long. I was OVERJOYED when I got off the train as I was feeling motion sick from lack of fresh air and rough ride.",

I had also travelled during tighter covid restrictions so there is no way that this can be attributed to covid, although I can already feel the excuses being typed. Mind you and sort of communication now would be good since I provided feedback via the email address months ago - it\u2019s now mid April and despite numerous chases I still have had no response from them. Shocking \u201ccustomer service\u201d. Everything is worse than it was with Virgin - what a disaster!!

Despite by their own admission they know that the drink and food service is a big part of why people buy first class in the first place!\n\nNo food and drink service is happening too often to be just an accident, they very clearly are running a scam to charge top dollar without having to actual provide any of the services they advertise, and knowing they have an effective monopoly on certain routes they think they can get away with it.\n\nAvoid first class entirely and if at all possible consider another provider.

After finally managing to set up an account Avanti would only refund one of the four tickets I purchased as their system cannot cope with someone purchasing more than one ticket at a time. I had purchased four tickets as it was a family trip to London - but impossible to obtain refund for more than one. Unfortunately Avanti now has a monopoly on north west main line and it will be 10 years before Virgin (who were willing to refund for actual tickets purchased rather than only one no matter how many tickets you purchased and used) get another shot at this. If you have no option but to use Avanti make sure you only book one ticket at a time - ridiculous administrative hassle but this company likes to make it as hard as possible for you to access reasonable level of service.",

        "review_text": "Last year, after a significant and unexplained delay and after raising a complaint, I finally received some rail vouchers from Avanti that I was entitled to. I also received a letter apologising for the delay and offering me a 25 per cent discount on my next journey. In order to obtain this discount I would need to buy my next ticket over the phone and quote a reference number given in the letter. I tried to phone on a number of occasions but always got recorded messages saying I was in a queue with an expected waiting time of never less than fifteen minutes and frequently of an hour or more. I ended up booking online and paying the full price. This morning, needing to make another journey, I tried again and this time got through surprisingly quickly. A helpful woman told me the reference number I quoted was no longer valid as a new system had been introduced. She went off to consult her manager and I was kept on hold for a while, with constant reassurances from her that the problem was being resolved, until she was able to give me a discount code which she told me I could use at the checkout when booking online. So, I book my ticket online, am about to enter the discount code when I read that they cannot be used in conjunction with a rail card. I\u2019m a Senior Railcard holder. The reduction the card gives is greater than the 25 discount I would receive by using the code. So the whole sorry exercise has been a complete waste of my time and phone bill.",

        "review_text": "Avanti are a joke. In January we were returning from Euston to Manchester on a Saturday evening. They started cancelling all of the trains north due to lack of staff. We cancelled our plans and raced to the station as we realised there was only one train home. We got to the barrier to be told we couldn\u2019t board because they didn\u2019t allow you to embark less than 2 minutes prior to departure. A fair enough rule perhaps but it was 4 minutes from departure and didn\u2019t leave for another 8 minutes anyway as the staff weren\u2019t on the train yet. As we were arguing the toss the staff approached and were allowed through. Made no sense. We were a foot from the train, on time, the train was then late, the staff weren\u2019t on it and they knew it was the only train home for us. Needless to say we had a nightmare journey home.\n\nFast forward to last weekend. We went to Wembley to watch England play. Only two trains available post match one of which was impossible to make if you wanted to see the end. The only train you could make then got cancelled. Had to leave the game early, travel for about 4 hours with various stops. All this cost over \u00a3100 each.\n\nThe trains are dirty, the staff do nothing about people sat in your pre booked seat and the toilets are an absolute disgrace if they are even open. \n\nUnfortunately I doubt any of this will change because there isn\u2019t an alternative so it seems there is little motivation for them to improve.",

The trains are far inferior to the Virgin trains that used to run on this line.  For \u00a325 per ticket per journey you can upgrade to \u2018premium\u2019 and standard class is very much third class.  Tight on room, dirty and usually overbooked.   I have made three return journeys from Blackpool North in the last few months and have had to travel via Manchester for two of the six journeys.  Last Sunday there were a huge number of cancellations from Euston on all Avanti services due to staff shortages.  They announce this as though it\u2019s an act of God not their own mismanagement.  However, the staff at Euston were very helpful in rearranging our journey.  I know there were reasons why Virgin were denied the continued running of this service but it has resulted in a huge drop in standards for the consumer.",

So they are running 20 year old trains that badly need replaced.\n2) Prices have went up.\n3) Service frequency has reduced from my station (Macclesfield) to London.\n4) First class lounge at Euston is table service only.  They will say this is because of COVID (which is nonsense). In reality, it's a way to cut cost by sitting you down and ignoring you for half an hour.\n5) Food in first class is poor. Options are limited, menu items are not fulfilled and you will be VERY LUCKY to be asked if you want a second drink.",

Avanti however, after been on hold for 50 minutes, while their message told me 15 minute waiting time, a unfriendly woman told me no, you cannot have your money back. This is for a trip 10 days from calling them. She did not care at all and just said that it is their T&C's and what Trainline did was up to them. This is not the first time Avanti service is appalling.... Wish Virgin Trains was still here....shame on you Avanti",

This is no way to treat returning customers, even a free coffee, free upgrade to first class as a gesture of goodwill. The train we did get on was full of football fans drinking, swearing and shouting at 9.23 in the morning. You don\u2019t see an inspector then do you??? Disgraceful service!!!??!",

Also had conflicting messages from employees who when challenged on their \"view of what you had done\". The conductor, then subsequent Avanti staff really rude, talking over you and then retracting the initial help offered. We even watched someone who hadn't pay walk away whilst they tried to assault her by using physical force before then letting her leave and then charging us \u00a394.00 for a ticket we had booked online but due to a machine error this hadn't printed both. We showed reciept from the machine, from trainline and also our bank transfer. They would rather harass paying customers for more money than actually tackle the issue with people not paying. No humanity, no compassion or empathy and treated like a criminal despite having proof of tickets. Ridiculous company which I'd rather walk than use!! Boycot this shammy company who are represented by absolute clowns!!! The disparity between their website and actual customer service is unreal and again the staff who some struggled with common courtesy left both myself and my wife feeling absolutely scammed by a reputable company. Time to turn the rail back to the state because this company through its rude and inflammatory staff members X 4 have shown that Avanti trains are inept in every fashion and focus on being rude and escalatory rather than genuine customer service.

Train to London over 90mins late, overcrowded and couldn't even get to seats we had booked. Stood all the way and in pain due to medical condition. Return train from London cancelled. Next train cancelled. Ended up having to go to Rugby and again get picked up and taken to retrieve my car. Avanti have refunded a measly \u00a312, having first tried to tell me my return train was not delayed, then telling me its was delayed leaving but arrived on time.

Having just spent a week in Great Ormond Street hospital in London with my daughter who had two brain surgeries, I was getting stressed in a very busy standard class. Worrying about all the bags above her head and not being able to sit next to her. I decided to upgrade to 1st class, no matter the cost. I was a bit distraught and very worried about the journey ahead (13.37 train to Blackpool, our stop was Wolverhampton) and I think the attendant picked up on this & the obvious head bandage & stitches. They upgraded us to 1st class for free and treated us like a queen & princess, giving us beautiful afternoon tea. It honestly bought tears to my v distressed eyes. \n\nStuart and team.

We had first class tickets so boarded the first of 2 available carriages and stowed our luggage. We were then confronted by the rudest young lady Avanti employee who basically told us that the carriage was only for her Avanti customers and there would be no service for anyone else . My wife attempted to explain that we were not requiring food , but only a seat and tea if possible . This was rudely ignored and she basically repeated her previous statement and told us and another visiting American couple who had also boarded , to leave. To be clear , we are pensioners , we were cold and exhausted , had first class tickets and there was plenty of room in the carriage and as it was now direct to Edinburgh, noone else would be boarding . I was a Senior Manager when i worked in Financial Services and i travelled a lot on mainly air and rail . This kind of attitude is NEVER allowed in firms who pride themselves in customer service . The Americans were appalled \u2026 Avanti need to address this or lose customers.",

        "review_text": "I won't bother mentioning the near-constant delays, the daily cancellation of services because of a lack of staff to cover, etc., etc., because they share this ignoble trait with West Midlands Trains who also operate services into Birmingham for the area; instead, I'll focus on the Avanti app and the Customer Service Assistants which sit behind it.\n\nIn a word: laughable.  Or it would be if these things didn't waste my time, money and effort.\n\nThe Avanti app - which I was told by the aforementioned CSAs, had been re-written for an 18th February re-launch (it wasn't/hadn't at time of writing) in order to iron out \"known bugs\" - manages the absolute basics reasonably well ... but has some distinct limitations such as the inability to book a ticket from around 15 minutes before the train you require actually arrives (or is scheduled to arrive).\n\nThen there's the fact the app changed (changes?) return train tickets to singles during the booking process if you have to add in a new payment method or reconfirm your password or change it because their systems are 'confused' (a trait that's common between app and staff!).  Having had to re-enter passwords and this code and that several times (because it informed me my password was incorrect - it wasn't) I didn't notice this change in ticket type. \n\nI'm extremely technically-literate ... so none of this is simple user error, as the CSA's attempted to insinuate!\n\nUltimately, I gave up with the CSA's as their idea of customer service is to:\ni)  Take an inordinate amount of time to respond (after the obsequious and platitudinous auto-response promising faithfully that you are a valued customer - utter rubbish); then \nii)  Respond as if they've read someone else's eMail correspondence; thirdly, \niii)  Reply to additional correspondence with the all-too-typical \"...that's not our department, you need to contact X, Y, Z...\" instead.\n\nCustomer service is all about ownership of the problem and, as part of that, actually understanding what the issue is happens to be a rather fundamental part of that process.  These CSA's (quite the misnomer, that, as customer service is clearly not something they are attempting) seemingly don't even have the most basic grasp of the English language either that or - and call me cynical here - Avanti are hoping customers simply give up when faced with such manifest ineptitude.  I know I have!\n\nSo, I gave up - after all, it was only a few quid - and decided to write this instead: a far better use of my time than dealing with this bunch of fools.\n\nIt's no wonder most companies don't publish a telephone help line (or bother answering it in a timely fashion) because then their customers would actually be able to hold them to account for their poor service then and there, as opposed to all this frustratingly drawn-out to-ing and fro-ing where the supplier is in complete control of the process, not the customer.  \n\nBut, then, these suppliers know this ... which is why they can get away with such dire customer service in the first instance.  It's simply too much trouble to go through all the formal channel to remedy service shortfalls.\n\nPS  AWC - please don't bother replying to this correspondence in order to salve your corporate image, your platitudinous rhetoric has wasted far too much of my time already.",

        "review_text": "I booked two tickets to Euston on the Avanti web page. I successfully reserved our preferred seats for the outgoing journey but when I tried to change the default Avanti choice for the return journey the web page crashed - several times, until I gave up trying and accepted the original seats. I then emailed Avanti to report the crash (with diagnostics) and a request to  amend the seat reservation four days before the outward trip. I got a reply ten days after that, and seven days after we'd returned home. It ignored the report of the software fault and suggested it might be better if I got in touch as soon as I could (possibly before I made the reservation?). Hell is truly a place where the Italians run the railways",

        "review_text": "Awful experience several times travelling first class. We had several return trips going from Wolverhampton to London in Nov/Dec. Back in Sept, they relaunched their first class dining service to much fanfare after a hiatus caused by the pandemic. \n\nOn each of the return journeys in Nov/Dec they had 'declassified' the train meaning there is no first class. Not that anybody bothers to tell you that, so you're left wandering, wondering and without any of the promised food, drink and service (and some customers even lost their reserved first class seats to yobs from standard class who told them that declassified means a free-for-all and any seat can be taken by anyone) and dying of thirst as we hadn't bought any drink, and couldn't even access the cafe carriage as it was two connected trains running as one and we were on the dark side.\n\nOn one journey, the train manager cheerily tells us it's easy to get a refund as Avanti know that journey was declassified. Yea, try getting a reply via the complaints form. Finally, after one completed form, three emails, two months and dozens of tweets to them, we have received a cheque for the 'first class' part of the ticket. Cashing the thing will cost me yet more time. Don't bother!\n\nAll-in-all a horrible experience and I will never go first class with them again - I'll sit in standard with a load of M&S food, it'll make us much happier and relaxed as these experiences ruined the start and end of our weekends away. In fact... I'd rather drive.\n\nAwful, awful AWFUL.",

Every single journey I took with them involved delays which caused missed connections (one time, my girlfriend visited me in Edinburgh, took the last Avanti train back, and ended up having to spend \u00a360 on a hotel overnight in Birmingham because of the delay which caused her to miss her connection). There were never refunds or compensation for this. The trains themselves are cramped, stuffy, and nauseatingly hot, with no guarantee that you'll have access to a plug socket. The Wi-Fi does not work. Considering the sheer discomfort and impracticality of the service, one might expect the prices to be low and affordable, attracting customers, but the prices are the same as LNER services. For the same price, you can take a train which is always on time, spacious, air-conditioned, equipped with chargers at every single seat, and not to mention the gorgeous views of Durham, Newcastle and the coast.

Last time I checked, you don\u2019t actually need a reservation to get a ticket or travel on a train - so why you can\u2019t just book a ticket online without a seat reservation is beyond me. Even when I book over a month in advance for off peak trains, I\u2019m looking at train fare of around 50 quid each journey. This is ridiculous! It never used to be this expensive, especially when booking in advance. Avanti know they have a monopoly on this line and have inflated prices beyond what is reasonable. If the trains were regular and ran on time I would mind a bit less but there are constant cancellations and delays - and then they try and short change you for delay repay and you have to put in a formal complaint to try and get your money back!

The seat booking system would not allow me to select my own seats - every time I tried this I got a message to say there was a problem and it cancelled the whole booking. After about an hour I eventually made the booking by finding a train that did have seats on a date I didn\u2019t want to travel. Unfortunately I had to cancel the trip due to getting Covid. I was charged a \u00a330 admin fee, \u00a310 per ticket. All the admin required was by me pressing a button on their app. This is a complete rip off \u00a330 for a service I did not even receive. During a pandemic this is not acceptable. ScotRail charge a \u00a310 fee per booking not per ticket.

        "title": "0 STARS - REFUSED REFUND EVEN THOUGH TRAIN CANCELLED AND DEATH IN FAMILY",
        "review_text": "Purchased rail tickets that cost over \u00a3150 for me and my wife to go to London. Train got cancelled from Glasgow Central to London Euston. We and other passengers were instructed by Avanti West Coast (AWC) advisor at Glasgow Central (GLC) that no more trains running that day from GLC and that we and other passengers can apply for full refund ANYTIME and we would get full refund regardless of whether we get to London or not. However unfortunately AWC advisor did not alert us that there is 28 day cut-off policy. We were then advised by AWC advisor at GLC that trains were running from Carlisle to London that day. We then drove from just outside Glasgow to Carlisle only to be told that the trains from Carlisle to London are also cancelled all day after paying to get the car booked for 3 days. Also  wasted money for that car parking also. So in the end we never got to London. Made numerous attempts to contact trainline as tickets had been purchased from them. Once we finally got through to correct person at trainline we were told that we had to contact Avanti as just over 28 days period and could not authorise refund without AWC consent. Which at this time found confusing as we were told could apply for refund anytime. Numerous attempts to contact AWC (contact phone number really difficult to find online) and eventually got through to Avanti customer resolution team after nearly 2 hours just to be told that they would pass it on and someone would be in touch. This call lasted about 3 minutes after waiting nearly 2 hours. We explained to AWC advisor reasons for delay in requesting refund over the phone. Not just being misinformed by AWC advisor in Glasgow but that we also had a death in family. My wife's brother died at 47 unexpectedly and that we were dealing with this and my wife was in a really bad way and still is. I also have ADHD (unmedicated) which is a neurological disorder and did not help in dealing with this issue as I have memory problems and trying to remember to deal with the refund was extremely difficult as well as supporting my wife while she was grieving for the loss of her brother. We finally received a really really short email after 4 weeks from AWC advisor by the name of Bacher (not sure why he took so long to get in touch given the poor response) just to tell us that although sympathetic they would not refund us as just over the 28 day policy. Today I contacted AWC and spoke to a Nadimah and asked for Bacher to contact me and also to lodge the complaint as she is a customer relations advisor. Both requests were denied by her and she told me she would not do this and I needed to go online and lodge the complaint this way. After my brother in law passed away me and my wife eventually contacted numerous organisations such as the hotel, theatre, and other event organisers explaining that we did not arrive in London due to cancellation of train but also due to death in family and they all provided a refund without debate or delay.  Really disgusted and appalled by AWC delayed and poor response and lack of care toward their customers.",

        "title": "Upgraded Seats Great/App UNUSABLE - the rest Not So Much!",
        "review_text": "I'm torn on this review. We had a very nice trip from London to Liverpool in Premium Economy (or whatever their name is for this option). The seats were great and so for comfort they deserve 5 stars. BUT that's where the praise ends. Once onboard, we were excited to use the promised \"in seat ordering\" and after waiting an hour for the website ordering to become active, I finally asked when the attendant passed by, and he was genuinely amused that we thought we would be getting that option. Apparently they never have enough staff to provide that promised \"perk\" for the upgrade. And when we finally did get to the cafe car, they had exactly 1 sandwich left and 1 burger. Everything else that would have been \"fresh food\" was SOLD OUT! So, dining would get 2 stars, as a hamburger for breakfast was not top of my list. But it's the APP that deserves 1 star because of a HUGE glitch: because I have a US registered Apple account, the Avanti app comes up as \"Not available in your country or region\". That doesn't happen with all UK based apps I've downloaded and used, so it must be a setting that Avanti has set for their app. And for a train line that most certainly has a great number of tourists on board from various countries, it's absurd to make it a UK available only app. No problem using the National Rail app on my iPhone. No problem using Great Western App on my iPhone. But Avanti? Nope! And the website maybe gets a 1.5 rating.",

Just spent an hour trying to book a Weekend trip to Liverpool 1st class from Birmingham International on 25th February out, and 27th back, as our hotel is next to Lime Street for my Wife\u2019s birthday. This should be simple, Scottish train to Crewe and pick up a London-Liverpool train.It\u2019s impossible in 1 booking. Add a journey function, for multiple trains does not work .Trains don\u2019t appear or pricing doesn\u2019t, or if it does, blocks proceeding to book. Even tried 4 separate bookings as we change at Crewe. Avanti web site believes there is no first class on Sunday27th.The Avanti CEO must be a clown as he is running a complete circus. Sack your IT department!!! Public transport should be easy to book. Your whole offering is a shambles from booking to pricing, reliability to satisfaction. How can a company have so little customer satisfaction and survive, moreover how does its management team. End result chose to drive simply because it\u2019s easier than your booking system",

        "review_text": "We booked 6 tickets from Preston to Edinburgh via trainline for a visit  on 10th December 2021 to the Xmas markets. This was instead of driving, age of the train etc etc.\nThe train from Preston to Edinburgh was packed and even though we had booked our seats  previously we couldn't move. At Lancaster the train emptied slightly and the staff showed us to our seats. The rest of the journey was pleasant. On return 2 days later we arrived at Waverley station (Edinburgh) to find the train to Preston had been cancelled, no explanation???? The station staff were un helpful. We were told to either wait for two hours for another train (no guarantee of a seat) or take a train from Edinburgh to York - York to leeds - Leeds to Preston passing our home town but our car was at Preston! We took this option, we left Edinburgh at 12.20 and arrived home at 18.30. 6 hours which should have been around 3 hours. We got \u00a340 compensation.......\n\nI won't be using the train again I'll drive!",

We were not sitting together  so looked for available seats, to rest at.  We found four seat avaiable, sat down started our lunch.  Then came along an angry girl with her mother, shouting at me about the seats.  The guards came along and started reinforcing this claim you need to move. We left protesting because the seats were clearly marked free. Later on the ticket collection round  we tackled the train manager who apologised and confirm the train reservation system had  at fault and provided the wrong reading on the seat status. The irony of all of this was  the carriage was 40% empty and went i got another site. Why are people so ignorant, no empathy just shouting about a stupid seat.",

Most other train companies use the same ticket booking system where the trains are arranged vertically. Avanti on their own planet use a completely different layout and it makes it really difficult to be certain of what you're actually buying. It also forces you into creating an account.\n\nAlso last year tried to book tickets to go down to London and the website insisted I reserved seats. Couldn't find any seats for me to reserve, went with Chiltern Railways instead.\n\nNever had a good experience with Avanti. They are a poor replacement for Virgin trains.",

I spoke to Hannah over the Facebook who tried to help me, but at first was reluctant to give me a contact detail until I mentioned the difficulty to explain my case over messages.

Which may explain why there was not a single public announcement on the return journey until we were pulling into Central Station. Several times on the outbound journey we had announcements about the possibility of \"upgrading your seat\" for \u00a330 for which you had more room and charging points at your seat. Even standard timetabled First Bus services in Glasgow have USB points to charge phones and iPads, without the need to pay MORE! If you have an alternative means of travel - do it!",

        "review_text": "Avanti have an appalling website design for finding and booking the cheapest available tickets. (1) They purposefully do not show +/-3 day and Monthly View options for their customers to find the cheapest tickets available on their service, dare I say to increase their sales revenue. (2) Their website will describe and label a ticket as 'Cheapest' but in fact cheaper tickets are often available if scrolling arduously through their departure options. (3) There is no way to print a Transaction Receipt from their User Account feature. The list goes on. Why did they not learn and carry over at least some of the positive customer experience lessons learned by Virgin Trains from their many years of running the service? It really is a poor show considering that the franchise award was supposed to offer us all better value and quality.",

This all on top of the horrendous experience a couple of years back where they charged me 5 times for the same journey, again due to a fault with their online booking system. It really makes the entire process a miserable, dystopian exercise in frustration. I truly, truly dread the future, as my parents are getting older now and the disgusting price scalping of passengers in the UK coupled with Avanti West Coast's awful service make me dread regular trips to look after my elderly parents 200 miles away. If you are paying \u00a3300 for an urgent same day journey you'd expect a Gold Standard of service. If you are paying \u00a3100 for an off-peak return you would still expect a Gold Standard of service.

They have told me that rather than confront a passenger, they won't do anything.  Also, apparently, when they think the train is going to be busy, all reserved seats are 'off the table' and it's a free for all.  This is unacceptable.  As a severely sight impaired passenger, this answer is not helpful.  Other train companies tell customers who have unreserved seating to sit in a particular carriage - why can't AWC follow this?  AWC need to take a further look at their policies and procedures and learn from other train companies.  I was given the excuse that the train was probably full due to cancelled prior trainis etc. but this isn't the case as it was the first train out of Birmingham.  Very sad state of affairs.  If I could use another company I would.  Bring back Virgin trains.",

But oh my god, PLEASE bring them back, Avanti are just awful! \n\nBefore the pandemic I travelled from Warrington to London Euston every week, and as it was on business I used the first class service so I could work at my seat and get a bite to eat. I've been working from home for nearly two years now, but a month before Christmas I started to travel to London again.\n\nI then came across Avanti for the first time. Well, I say came across... it was often late so I was more often than not stood around waiting. Then, the first class service is just DIRE - the food is just abysmal (when they have it - twice now I've been told that they have no food left when the train isn't even close to full), drinks are a rarity and of poor quality, and the staff seem distracted and irritated. The carriage isn't cleaned properly, and the booking system is a joke - it crams everyone into one half of one carriage, when you're supposed to be socially distancing. \n\nNow I could go with this if the cost had been reduced, but it's not, oh no... it's a LOT higher than Virgin too! So I'm paying a premium for a much, much worse service - how can that be right? \n\nI'm sorry, but this outfit needs stripping of it's franchise, it's an absolute disgrace. The operators have a complete monopoly on these services, so I guess nothing will happen, especially as the government are otherwise distracted. But I won't be travelling down often anymore, perhaps once every month or two, and when I do I won't be going first class - I can't bring myself to pay hundreds of pounds more than standard for a plate of cold pasta. \n\nOne word - avoid.",

Their response to my latest refund request via their website (the fourth, if you include the complaint I put in) was met with . . . wait for it . . . a link to the (same) website where I could put in a refund request! It would be funny if it wasn't so dire. And the reason the train didn't run? We still don't know, as they did not exactly cover themselves in glory that day: zero communication, not even between managers and their own staff on duty at the station. In fact, I was informed by one staff member that management had requested staff to stop contacting them for updates. This says it all. These people are clowns: bring back Virgin asap and, in the meantime if you can find any other way to make your journey, I recommend that you do. This is not the first problem I have encountered with Avanti. They couldn't run a bath never mind a railway.",

Managed for the outbound journey though was told I would need to change the return seats on the actual train when we boarded.  There were no forward facing seats available on the return journey.  Perhaps they lied to me on the phone? Very deceitful and misleading. We had to move to a carriage that wasn\u2019t first class and therefore we could not take advantage of the service we had paid for. Avanti are refusing to compensate us.

        "review_text": "My 85yr old mother booked train to come and see me for Christmas and New Year. I did warn her of my bad experiences. She booked passenger assistance to help her stay safe and move round the stations. Preston did not even arrive to assist her, left her to fend for herself, and get from platform 6 to platform 2 with suitcase. She could have fallen, had an accident, anything could have happened. Avanti West Coast did not care about her at all, and I have asked them if they would treat their own family members in this way. It was a journey to come and see me, spend time with me, as I have advanced cancer, and she wanted to simply spend some time with me. So she booked first class and assistance, only to be left to fend for herself. This potentially has knocked her confidence to ever see me again.",

There are almost always delays meaning you miss your connection, the carriages are overcrowded, impossible to get a seat, it\u2019s COVID Central, and yet first class is available? Why have 3x 1st class which are empty, when there is massive overcrowding on the other carriages? Now the number of trains on offer are reduced, the travel time to get to Euston have increased massively as have the prices, it\u2019s utterly scandalous. I will be writing to my MP, something has to be done to take this franchise away from this joke company. One has to conclude that they bribed their way to this franchise, we should demand a public enquiry in to how on earth they won this from Virgin who were doing a very effective job.

The only way I knew the service would take hours was because a friend of mine called me from the train before us which had broken down.

I asked him if it might be a good idea to clean it all up and he shrugged shoulders and walked off.  Tonight the train was cancelled twice which isnt unsual since these guys started running the service, the third one was showing online and at the platform as on time so i waited in sub zero temperatures for the 21:01 service (its now 20:56)  Then on the tannoy and service announcement \"We apologise but the 21:01 has been cancelled due to a untrained member of staff with coronavirus\"  literally them words which was baffling but i was more concerned that with only 5 mins before train arrival they notify of cancellation.  Absolutely shocking practice as provider of public transport to say the least, pointless trying to complain as they simply dont respond.  I will be putting my car back on the road as trying to help the climate actually affects my health as the country simply cant function anymore!",

Due to unforseen Covid circumstances, i can't travel. I accept i can't get a refund, but their website clearly states that they will give an e-voucher for travel in the next year.  Upon trying to get this, i couldn't find a form specifically dealing with e-vouchers, so filled in the only refund form.  I got an email today saying i can't get a refund on an advance ticket, which i know, and to apply for an e-voucher. They sent me a link to the same form i have already filled out! I have been over and over this form and My Account and the help pages on Avanti's website, to no avail.\nThey are obviously making it as difficult as possible to claim so that people will give up. I will never book Avanti again",

Wasn\u2019t allowed to board the train as apparently there are only four bike slots on the entire train. What world do these guys and gals live in. Firstly why four bike slots for the entire train, I mean how\u2019s that supposed to encourage people to use micro mobility transport, improving city centres by reducing air pollution and traffic. Not to mention a booking system that didn\u2019t mention that effectively if you ride a bike then you aren\u2019t welcome. Absolute load of rubbish. Fortunately I\u2019m in the economic position to buy another car, which sadly remains the only way of ascertaining convenience and flexibility.

Nothing happened, no redirecting back to Avanti, no booking ref - nothing. \n\nI went back to the Avanti website and see the 2 tickets still in the basket - same journey, same dates, same seats.  So, thinking the payment has not gone through, I go through the process again.  This time I'm redirected back from Paypal to Avanti website where I see my booking ref. \n\nFollowing day I get 2 confirmations from Avanti under different booking refs for exactly the same journey - same dates, same times, same seats.  And my paypal account has been charged twice.  \n\nI tried ringing customer services - after 40 minutes, \u00a312 (its an 0345 number so 30p a minute with my mobile network) and a lot of crappy hold music I hung up.  \n\nI've now had to use the very convoluted process on their website to request a refund - 2 separate requests for 2 tickets.  Their link to their help/refund page doesn't work either.  \n\nThe overarching impression I have of Avanti is that their business is purely a money making exercise with little or no regard for the customers that they need to make that money - a typical profits before people scenario.\n\nTheir website is not fit for purpose - how can you buy the same seats twice??  I can't be the only one this has happened to.  \n\nSo far I have wasted a colossal amount of my time trying to deal with Avanti's incompetence.",

Holding senior railcards we were able to book first class travel at very reasonable prices. We were dismayed when the franchise was taken away from Virgin as we considered this the best franchise in the UK - frequent and reliable travel at a good price. Having not travelled by train since Covid first hit we felt confident now to book travel to London again. When I tried booking with Avanti I felt sure I was making a mistake in my booking but no, the price has more than doubled!!!  For what? Looking at the reviews on Trustpilot I see 84% of reviews are for just 1 star - shocking. At the price now quoted it is far cheaper for us to travel by car which is what we intend to do. Bring back Virgin and their pricing!",

The carriages are not very well designed, with many seats having no window and minimal luggage space. I didn't mind so much with Virgin as prices were good on the whole, and the staff were friendly. Avanti is awful though. Passive-aggressive tannoy announcements warn against sitting in the wrong place, and delight in explaining how little you get in the 'upgraded' seats. They don't seem to be able to operate the aircon either, so you boil or freeze. Trying to select a seat whilst booking online is like playing a really bad and lengthy computer game, once invested in the process, you don't want to stop, but ultimately you can never win....so end up booking on the Trainline instead, happy to pay a booking fee even if you can't choose you seats, as at least you will be seated together.",

I have since tried relentlessly to get my monies back for the train service they failed to provide and still being fobbed off. Avanti West coast took my money, cancelled a service and have failed to reimburse me the monies for a service they have not provided. If a company fails to provide a service, consumers are entitled to their money back.

I normally travel first class but I decided to use the Standard Premium service because of the skyrocketing prices, even with a railcard. Also on my last few first class journeys they squished us into the half carriage K while the two standard premium coaches were empty - personally I'd prefer the space over the mediocre first class food. I still paid over \u00a3150 for a SP return and, when attempting to order a coffee on their much-advertised at-seat service I was greeted repeatedly with an error message. On querying this, I was told that staff member was sick so no at seat service on this train. I was travelling EUS to GLA so that was 5 hours of schlepping up and down pretty much the entire train to the shop. Then almost \u00a33 for an americano. Honestly dont give these charlatans your money - find the cheapest standard ticket you can and bring your own food.",

I followed  instructions  in  the email .Web site would not allow me to amend travel dates . I then sent Avanti an email to request a refund I did this before 6pm day before travel to avoid admin fees.\n\n3 days later received email asking for same information  again booking ref and copies of tickets.Heard nothing since from Avanti why having a booking promise and then not honour it.\n \nLooks like Avanti are doing everything  to avoid refunding . It's a shame  when train companies are trying to encourage  people to travel with them.\nMaybe railway ombudsman  need to be aware of these issues .",

Paid \u00a32 for special delivery with an expected arrival date of 16th. Nothing has come. \nI did receive an e-ticket for a trip from Euston to Glasgow for the 29th of October which made me think some kind of fraud had been committed but online they assured me some kind of error had been made despite getting text updates right up to the time of travel yesterday. Makes me think someone had my tickets and exchanged them. Anyway, twice I\u2019ve been told to hold tight and wate a few more days! Tickets still show on my account, but I can\u2019t get through on the phone and despite doing the pointless live text/msg no one will call me. \nI would happily take an e-ticket or collect from Euston or any other station but apparently this can\u2019t be done.

I think not! So, why even list costs like that? I wanted to take my son to London during the half term. Looked in advance and it was financially impossible! Avanti are a disgrace to this country and should be held accountable for restricting economical travel to the masses in the UK with prices like that! They\u2019re not just ruining school holidays but also the lives of people in this country! To top the lot, the service is awful and the trains are dirty. It was never like this with Virgin. Branson knows how to provide service but expects at least some profit and rightly so but as usual, he was probably screwed by the typical bureaucracy inherent in this country!",

The main worry I had was finding space for all our luggage but that became a minor concern when an email arrived announcing the train we were due to travel on had been cancelled. We had to drop everything and cut our last day short. On arriving at the station the Avanti staff were not at all helpful and more or less shrugged us off and sent us to the ticket office to try and scramble on to another service but now with no seats booked. The ticket office (not Avanti staff) was very helpful and we ended up on a direct train to Edinburgh. After racing to the unallocated carriage we managed to find seats together and finally felt able to relax. That was a mistake. As we neared Scotland the tannoy came on to announce that the train was going to finish at Carlisle instead due to staff shortages. Cue another dose of stress and having to get everything off the train and ready for another scramble on to a yet to be confirmed service. Only thanks to LNER were we able to get home on their service which was unusually diverted to Carlisle. I will never travel by Avanti again and likely not by rail to be honest.",

The trains are constantly broken- the amount of times the reservations simply don\u2019t work is ridiculous! This means people always sit in my reserved seats and sometimes refuse to move. It makes the whole journey awkward when it shouldn\u2019t even be an issue in the first place.\nSecondly- the prices are too high. As a regular user of this service for the past five years I have seen the prices rise constantly and yet have only received  worse service in return. \nThe introduction of standard premium is simply a joke. There is no way it is worth paying \u00a325 more to be able to access a table seat. First class tickets used to be reasonably priced for off peak journeys but now they are ridiculously high and there is no option for a relatively cheap on board upgrade. Disappointing all round. \nFinally, despite demand being seemingly high (lack of tickets available and trains always busier than they used to be) Avanti are still running a reduced COVID service.",

The standard of food has dropped in quality and they are still using the old Virgin carriages. Where are the new trains that were promised? \n\nI won't pay their increased prices for first anymore either, quicker and much better to fly with BA Club europe.\n\nJust taken a trip in standard class.

Also I booked a complex journey of 2 legs with them- the Avanti train from Stockport to Milton Keynes was so delayed I missed the connection yet they transferred my claim to Southern - who I hadn\u2019t even travelled with. I had to appeal - that was turned down and then threaten to take my experience to my MP before they agreed to pay. I would never travel with them again if I had a choice but I don\u2019t because they have a monopoly on the Manchester to London line. Just recently I had to book with them again- again a complex journey with 3 children and they failed to email me my e- tickets- there is no contact number on their website and no chat function. I had to find my account through Google- again no link to my account on their website and try to download my tickets manually- which was extremely difficult as their site kept downloading the same ticket instead of the others. On the journey with 3 kids although I had reserved seats I was told the booking system wasn\u2019t working at the start of the journey so people were sitting anywhere I had to ask people to move so that I could sit near the children to look after them. This service is a absolute disgrace and a shambles yet ticket prices have gone up! They deserve a negative rating - yet I have to give them one star to review them.",

I used the Trainline instead - effortless, took under five minutes, just like buying tickets with Virgin Trains in the past.\n\nI complained about my experience and can confirm their Customer Relations department is dreadful, completely pathetic.  Their agent failed to understand my complaint twice so I escalated it to a manager.  A \"Duty Manager\" responded and clearly didn't understand either.  It has now go to the Ombudsman for review.  \n\nThe point of my complaint was to actually help them improve their website.  I was trying to be helpful - I gave them evidence of the issue and outlined why it was a bad experience for me a customer.  They were not interested.  Instead they happily told me multiple times how much they valued the feedback and how it would be shared with their Web Support Team and Technical Team - teams that operate behind frosted glass and that don't possess technology like phones or computers that allow them to communicate with either the customer or their Customer Relations department.  They are not allowed to interact with customers or Customer Relations - what a strange approach.  \n\nHowever, I was repeatedly assured that all the failings I presented to them - of which there were many - would be passed to those teams so they could improve the website experience for customers.\n\nWell I hope they do and I hope that customers benefit.  As for me I'll no longer use them for journeys between Scotland and England.  I will seek out Lumo Trains - a new business that seem passionate about providing a good service - or will use LNER (an excellent business) by using a different route to the one I enjoyed frequently with Virgin Trains.  Additionally, I'll consider flying as the cost of doing so is considerably cheaper than the tickets I have purchased from Avanti West Coast.\n\nIt is such a shame as I used to enjoy travelling on the West Coast Mainline when Virgin Trains, a professional, customer facing business, used to hold the franchise.\n\nMy advice is look for all alternatives before using Avanti West Coast.  You will save money and be happier.",

SHOCKING!!!\n\nMANAGEMENT, invest more in wifi. You charge enough for tickets. What use is there providing wifi to order at your seat food and beverage when the wifi never works. Surely it makes sense to invest and improve wifi. In turn your shops on the trains will make more money. Ripple effect.\n\nP.s. on the train so cant even submit review till i get off the flippen train",

After purchasing my tickets on line I arrived at the station to collect the tickets from the machine but though it recognised the code and journey, would not print. The customer service rep also tried, and failed to print the tickets. Their answer was ether buy another ticket or try and talk my way through without a ticket , which in my case would have been 5 different trains and two tube rides. That would be 14 automated ticket barriers and at least two tickets inspectors. All that with one email from Avanti that had had in big red letters \u201cThis is not a ticket \u201c\nI am trying to contact Avanti by phone but 45 minutes into the call I\u2019m still on hold!\nI could go on by constant delays, cancellations the hopeless app and worse web site, the impossibility of booking chosen seats etc etc but I guess anyone trying to travel by Avanti West coast probably knows that.\nIs this the worst Train company going.

End of July, Avanti notify me that the time table had been changed, and my train cancelled as a result. \nThe other trains were either fully booked, poor times, or too expensive, and I would need to pay the remaining balance, which was an awful lot more compared to the original advance tickets. \nIncluded within the notification email was an option to request a full refund if I chose not to travel that day, or purchase a new ticket. I chose the full refund option, and TWO MONTHS later, I'm STILL waiting. \nDespite dealing with FIVE different members of staff via their facebook inbox (all fob you off with the regular - this is not my problem/department, but someone will contact you within 48 hours blah blah). I'm still waiting for someone to contact me and that's been going on for almost a month. \nI've also tried THREE separate times via their customer resolutions department, and each occasion they've asked me to explain the full circumstances AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN...IS ANYONE BORED YET!?! Me too!!\nAVOID AVANTI WEST COAST LIKE THE PLAGUE! Their customer service is utterly abysmal, and should you ever find yourself in need of a refund, prepare to be fobbed off at every corner. \nThey provide fake names, empty assurances of a call / email back, they simply want to mug you off in every possible way. \nWhat a shame, as it used to be a favourite of mine, but rest assured I will never use them again. \nThanks for rewarding a loyal customer like this Avanti. \nIt's time to use your rival/s.",

Wanted to visit a friend in Stockport, and booked eight weeks in advance. They don't offer any return tickets for that weekend - turns out having looked at a few other weekends, it's a similar pattern. Avanti doesn't seem to offer return tickets, which I always thought was a pretty standard thing for a train company to offer. \n\nPrices - the price has increased significantly since Avanti took over the line from Virgin. That increase in price hasn't translated into better service.\n\nCustomer service - awful. Waited over an hour to speak to a customer service agent with no luck. Again, if the prices are increasing, surely that should translate into better service, not worse.\n\nAvanti is so bad it leaves you wondering how they won the contract from the government? Clearly, the reason wasn't because of Avanti increasing prices and offering terrible service, so why are they still maintaining the line?\n\nThe positives - the only good thing about Avanti is that the service is so shocking it works as an argument for nationalising the railways, so on that front Avanti is doing a magnificent job.",

Avanti booked so many customers on the train.  Passengers were standing in the aisles. No regard for customer safety or social distancing considering Covid is still with us. I felt very uncomfortable. I booked a table seat and it was apparent the table had not been cleaned, fortunately I had wet wipes with me. Expensive fares for a poor service.

This is what I did and it caused me undue stress and inconvenience.  Three months later I have received a refund for my online tickets minus an admin fee of \u00a310, what a blooming cheek!!! No explanation or apology , through no fault of my own I was refused the issue of my online tickets for a reason that has never been explained to me , Avanti did not address my complaint at all and decided to keep \u00a310 for themselves , I was expecting a full refund and perhaps some small compensation for the stress they caused me , but what I got feels like a slap in the face .",

So was the one before leaving around 10:20pm so basically no more trains for Coventry until the next day.\n\nFirst of all, you cancelled a train with nowhere near enough time to spare. Moreover it being the last train and de facto leaving me stranded in London for the night, the least you could have done would have been to enquire about customers without accommodation and if you could help in any way???? What good is it to me getting my ticket refunded when I have to pay a hotel in London??\nI am paying for a service i.e. getting from point A to point B if you cannot deliver that service you need to find solutions for people.\n\nSecond of all, you\u2019d sent me an email saying that since my train was cancelled, I could jump on the next available AVANTI train (so next morning). \nI wanted to \u201cchange\u201d my ticket using the app but it only directed me to the search function where basically I could pay for a ticket the next morning (which I shouldn\u2019t have had to do since my train was cancelled). \n\nSo I arrived at the train station with the email, I went to the platform where the train from Coventry was departing and explained to the controllers what had happened. \nThey wanted to see the original ticket which had disappeared since it was supposedly passed (even though the train never actually departed because cancelled), I could only show them the itinerary and the cancellation email.\nEven though I showed them the email where it was written in black on white that my train was cancelled and \u201cyour ticket is valid to travel on the next available Avanti West Coast stopping at Coventry\u201d they didn\u2019t even bother to look at what I was showing them and said to go to the ticket office (that was written NOWHERE in the email). I was literally begging them because the train was about to leave and I had all the proof possible (when YOU had cancelled the train making me spend the night in London and YOU had not provisioned for the case where the next train is the following day, and YOU had not made it possible to simply rebook without a fee the following train). They were actually quite rude saying that they didn\u2019t know of any cancellation and it wasn\u2019t their problem (great customer service).\n\nI had to run to the ticket office where the person I spoke to said that I just had to show the Avanti controllers my cancellation email\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \nThey ended up giving me a ticket to get the next train because obviously mine had left by then (mind you, I had to get to work in Coventry so not only did you cancel my train making me spend the night in London but you also made me late for work this morning). \nWhen I confronted the controller again saying what the ticket office had said he said that again it wasn\u2019t his problem. I informed him that I was going to make a complaint but he didn\u2019t care either.\n\nI have never experienced such an atrocious customer service, and I travel a lot, this is shameful.",

        "review_text": "We booked trains to and from London at least 3 months ago. Our outgoing train was due to leave our local station at 11.56. We arrived in plenty of time and sat waiting\u2026\u2026and waiting\u2026.nothing. We checked the timetable we had been given and it definitely said 11.56. There was no mention of this train on the departure boards, and when checking with the ticket office, the train had already left at 11.36!!! The staff were friendly but could only say that Avanti had changed their TT a year ago!! We ended up waiting for an hour altogether for the next train. It completely ruined our plans as we had arranged to meet with relatives. My daughter messaged them on Friday to complain, but has received no reply. We will never ever travel with this company again. They are appalling. \ud83d\ude21",

She (and I) is totally frustrated and disgusted and is worried that she may not get her refund as she has to now physically go to their ticket office, having had no luck on their website or via telephone.

Considering you are supposed to be able to change reservations up to 24 hours before with an appropriate ticket this is shocking.\n\nWhen you get on the train the reservation system also doesn\u2019t seem to work. The first time I used their service, people were double booked on seats and this time no reservations were downloaded onto the train. \n\nOn the table I was on none of the power sockets were working. In addition, the buffet car announced that once again the card machine wasn\u2019t working and they could only accept cash.\n\nWhat is going on with this company?

Not only did he stand back and watch a mum travelling alone struggle with a 3 year old, bags, suitcases and a dog, he also saw fit to publicly humiliate her into moving one of her bags that she had no choice but to leave near the door because of an overcrowded train. I then watched him punch the back of a woman's chair who was travelling alone and clearly quite startled to wake her up to check her ticket, despite the fact she had been on the train for 3 hours already and had her ticket checked at Euston. You'd think paying \u00a3150 for a train ticket would at least get you some basic customer service but apparently not on Avanti.",

I have been travelling to London from Wigan for more than 10 years with Virgin although not since Avanti took over and of course COVID. Never having gone first class I thought I would treat myself what a shock I was in for total waste of money. Firstly someone was in my seat but the passenger couldn\u2019t move because her backpack was very large no room in luggage rack which was very small. I was advised to sit in the single seat which was empty actually the one I would\u2019ve traveled home in. The seat was so cramped I could barely move even though I\u2019m a small slim person. The food was disgusting and only 2 choices, tea cold so only had water. Carriage extremely hot so much so I felt sick and lightheaded so had to move to the corridor outside toilets. Apparently Avanti use the same trains as Virgin  but on this occasion was definitely not. My return journey didn\u2019t happen with Avanti as I couldn\u2019t face it.Bring back Virgin. The only good part staff very helpful along with another passenger.",

These were duly supplied but time ran on with no further communication.\nEventually I wrote to the CEO's Office and I have now been told I will be compensated by a cheque in the post, for just the difference between the First and Standard Class ticket price.  \nNo additional goodwill gesture for the upset caused to my wife and I and no real appreciation of how poor the treatment of customers on the train really was.\nI will NEVER travel with this outfit again unless my life depends on it.\nThe awful Trustpilot review rating clearly shows that I am not alone in my feelings towards Avanti West Coast.

        "review_text": "Booked ticket several weeks in advance using their timetable to help me decide which train to choose. It involves a connection and I needed to plan my on going bus journey from the second trains arrival point and time. Arrived at my home station, the first train was not listed according to the time avanti gave me on the email confirmation (the same time that I had booked the train for). I queried this at the station only to be told avanti changed the times of the trains since I booked it. They offered to put me on the next train, but I would miss my connection and end up further north than I intended. So I had to cancel my accomodation and rearrange a new place to stay (it was non refundable). This was back in May 2021. I didn't post this review then because covid is affecting everyone and maybe avanti too. Although it would have been simple for them to just contact me to tell me the train I had booked was no longer running.\n\nI'm afraid to say this happened again two weeks ago. The only difference this time is that the later train they put me on went to the destination I had planned, just a few hours later. But this meant the last bus had already left, so I had to pay for an expensive cab fare. I would not have planned and booked my journey had I known that was the outcome. Also, the second time, I was not the only one in that position. There was a  family/group of 4 who were also at the CS kiosk at the station who were in the same position.  \n\nAll Avanti had to do was email their clients to update them on the rearranged train times. National rail had still listed the old train times a day before, on both occassions when I had checked. \nI have checked my inbox, junk mail and text messages, no contact from Avanti with regards to not running the train journeys I had booked.",

On line message was that the shop was closed but you could use the at seat order service by connecting to on board wi fi which I did. I stayed connected to the on board WiFi using it for other sites but not for at seat order which wouldn\u2019t connect\nOther passengers had the same issue and one went to the shop returning with soft drinks and advising that the shop IS open, he was told there was no on board wi fi so payment  had to be cash. BUT the tickets had been checked on board and payment for upgrades taken by card reader so there must have been wi fi.Feels like the service from Virgin was better. At seat service doesn\u2019t sound important but it\u2019s a great idea if you are travelling alone and disappointing when it doesn\u2019t exist, better not to have suggested it.

Do you think I'm just going for a train ride or would it be for a reason .And surprise surprise the train before and after mine where full so couldn't book me a seat so had to fight for the unreserved seating. Every journey pre-covid and now is cancelled, delayed ,overcrowded and not once arrived on time even though the journey time is 15 to 20 minutes longer on Avanti than it was on Virgin (same trains, same line) and still get in late .Last journey coming up Saturday which will no doubt be the same ,ailes full ,doorways full and even though I have seat reservations won't use the buffet car as its like such an effort to fight your way through. Its a shame that I will now be using from Saturday a different rail route as I can no longer look forward to my trips to London knowing that something will go wrong and wondering how much time I will loose of my day out waiting at Watford junction .Bring back Virgin all because of a minimal share of ownership we get stuck with Avanti .",

Soon after departure I was rudely told to get out of my seat because it was reserved by husband and wife. Suddenly confronted by very condesending and rude behaviour from a woman who after my showing her that no reservation was on the electronic seat numbers insisted and then presented her tickets and shoved them in my face to see. I think the woman expecting a performance of guilt, apology or subservience but of course I had done nothing wrong!! There was no indication that these seats were reserved!! In fact I had gone out of my way to check the seats were NOT reserved as per signs! Yet I was the one made to shuffle off as though I was causing an issue. The louder she raised her voice the more people tutted as though I had caused the problem.\n\nTo give you further context, given I have colleagues that work around Diversity & Inclusion, I was experiencing micro aggressions and stereotyping which was embarrassing. The woman was patronising. Of course I wouldn't have been viewed as the vulnerable one as the lone traveller even though I was experiencing the micro aggression and stereotyping due to Unconscious Bias! I asked her to calm down. This an embarrassing episode that could have been prevented and saved exeryone distress and embarrassment!! \n\nSort it out Avanti! \n\nIf people have their seats reserved please make sure it's indicated on the electronic panels. Save lone passengers experiencing the rude micro aggressions of irate customers projecting their anxiety on to you. The journey had barely started and my journey for which I paid good money was spoilt!\n\nSort it out.",

Next time I will fly and I suspect more and more customers will either drive or fly.\n\nAvanti will run themselves into the ground and they will probably only last another 12 months or so, unless they change their service and approach massively - Feels like another crisis for the West Coast line approaching.\n\nWhat a way to run a railroad!",

The train was unnaturally busy and it soon turned out that several seats had been double booked forcing passengers to sit in other seats. This undoubtedly caused chaos when the other passengers boarded and demanded their seats. On top of this there was another train doing the same journey scheduled for an hour later. This train was cancelled last minute and the ticket holders were told to board hours meaning the train was overcapacity with several people having to stand. There was next to no staff presence on the train. Obviously the overbooking of the train was no fault of theirs however it seemed they could have done more, if something to calm the situation. Terribly poor service and will not travel with them again if I can help it.",

They say I am covered by automatic refund but 'computer says ' in small print only if you register first. You have to register a different account for this even if you have an Avanti account and they have ALL your details - another ploy to prevent or make it so difficult to get a refund ?\n5. No attempt to assist with social distancing - was put in a seat in a crowded area despite other seats being available - of course I moved after an elderly woman directly opposite with no mask started coughing... and coughing.\n6. Despite putting a family railcard in ( only works on the app - myself and two children ) no family fixed price family ticket offered. This is three times now ! What a money spinner this must be!\n\nWhole process from trying to book, the journey itself and arriving ( on time if you are lucky) is appalling.

I mistakenly purchased a 1st class ticket on their website (which is awful) and having confirmed checked the price in Trainline 70quid cheaper. No way to cancel my ticket (even though website says you can). Have been e-mailing Avanti for weeks now to get my overpayment back, got one auto response after 24hrs and nothing since despite dozens of follow ups. For my own amusement I have randomly looked at more than 20 so called price guaranteed tickets and every single one is more expensive than the Trainline (same avanti train). I might be forced to use their trains sometimes but won\u2019t ever book with them and won\u2019t be using first class anymore as the service is not worth it. Did I say bring back Virgin.",

They ignored the fact that I had actually chosen to travel with Avanti because of the time it arrived into London.  Just because there was theoretically enough time for me to race to my end destination via other train connections without the rest break in London I had planned, this doesn't mean it's OK that Avanti turned up late.  To imply 'Yeah, we were late but other train companies' services made up for it so it's fine' is against the principle of Delay Repay.

        "review_text": "1 star because I can't give anything less. Since Avanti have taken over from Virgin you cannot get advance tickets. I regularly travel up north to see family in Wigan and Manchester. They say there are advance tickets to purchase, but I have yet to see any evidence of any. Every time I try to buy tickets (last time 2 months in advance), they just suggest an open return, which is \u00a310 more than Virgin used to be - \u00a394.50. I have bought an open return for this Friday to travel to Wigan. It says that you can change an open return free of charge, but you have to call them at the call centre. You can't get hold of anyone. I have called three times. I just was on hold for one hour, then got cut off. It is very, very poor customer service. I got in touch with someone on Facebook and someone replied - said they couldn't help me change my ticket, but gave me an email address. I just emailed and the response I got was - they aim to contact me in 28 days! Perfectly useless, when my journey is booked for Friday. Heaven knows how I am going to change my ticket......\n\nUpdate: 28/07/2021\nSo after waiting 1.5 hours I finally got through to an operator, who was very rude and condescending. I changed my ticket, but have not received a confirmation email or the new e-tickets. I looked in the app, and my amended journey is in there, but when I click on it, it goes to my old tickets and old reservation dates and times. I hope that I don't have to call them back to get a confirmation email and e-tickets. The operator had to ask for my email address, when he should have it since I gave him my booking reference. Such inefficiency is ridiculous. When I have amended journeys in the past with Virgin, they have sent me a confirmation email and new tickets before I have even hung up.",

Got on train to discover only 2 other people in entire carriage (K) Counted only 24 people in 4 first class carriages out of about 145 seats yet we couldn\u2019t get 2 seats together!!! Eventually just sat together!\nJourney was from Glasgow to Preston going down (17/3) returning (22/3) in First Class. Journey itself was pretty much on time. Seats ( eventually) were great! Very comfortable and clean. Toilets spotless. Food and drinks both ways were plentiful ( honestly thought I was going to be on a third world train reading some of the comments beforehand) Staff were excellent both ways but especially on the return train (11.41) - couldn\u2019t have been better. Think AWC will be happy when\u2018Covid booking\u2019 is over as they haven\u2019t updated their website to cope with that! If you are with your partner you can sit together-it doesn\u2019t tell you that! Bit of work for AWC to do overall to match Virgin IMO",

Warm rancid coffee and, since there is no spirits any more, rough red wine. No nibbles any more either. Or cake. Or newspaper.\n\nIt is the little things that make a difference. They no longer exist.

        "review_text": "First experience of Avanti. Absolutely rubbish. I was travelling with my 10 month old and had pre booked a first class ticket from Manchester to Euston a few weeks prior. \nThe day of travel coincided with the Euro finals. Avanti\u2019s website says don\u2019t travel without a reservation. When we got to the station we were told we couldn\u2019t board the train we had paid for a first class ticket, with seat reservation as it was full - and,  quote \u201c You have no rights as you\u2019ve only got an off peak ticket\u201d.\nIt transpires Avanti couldn\u2019t care less if you\u2019ve got a reservation - and just allowed as many chancing football fans, who hadn\u2019t reserved seats or tickets, to board the train, taking the seats of ore booked customers. They couldn\u2019t care less about the many, many customers who had booked the train and were now told they\u2019d have to use another service - and that wait could be a very long time! \nReturn journey I\u2019d upgraded to first class but was only in standard premium. Train manager was rude and advised those around me to move to first class but did not advise me my ticket was also valid. WiFi was rubbish. \nAppears lots of their trains are regularly cancelled, prices have also definitely gone up, but service is appalling. I\u2019m thankful I don\u2019t need to travel by train much now - Virgin are sadly missed",

The train ran fine and was clean but I have an issue with the customer service. \n\nArriving early (due to finishing work early) to be told you have an off peak ticket and it\u2019s \u00a380 for an upgrade is crazy. It doesn\u2019t help the lady could not have been more RUDE. No explanation just a go away or pay up. \n\nThe other option is to wait until after 09:00, so that\u2019s what I did. However the 09:15 train it turns out is also not an option but I only found this out when returning to the platform. This time Marie was equally rude and basically told me to F off (not her exact words but had the same impact) for another 30 minutes. \n\nIt turns out that anything north of Lancashire your off peak is 09:30 but in the south it\u2019s only 09:00. Nice to see the rich and poor aren\u2019t separated! What is also shocking is that the early trains were half empty and mine was packed due to the football, solid planning for a transport company during a pandemic. \n\nWhy not just give people like me the option to upgrade on the platform for \u00a310, fill up and empty train and sort your customer services out as speaking to people like that after a 14 hour night shift is shocking.",

No app like Virgin, no option to print at home. Are they in the 1990's or even 1890s? Then the day before we are due to travel we get an email saying our train might be canceled. I check National Rain enquiries. The train is canceled. They state on the email we can transfer to the train before or after, these trains are fully booked as they have cancelled every other train on their service for the rest of the day. If all of their passengers are told to cram onto other trains (that are by their own admission full) then their social distancing promises are clearly out the window. Tried to call them to get some clarity, I waited an hour on hold with no indication of progress before giving up. I have booked via Crewe with different operators now for less than half the price. I would advise everyone else to do the same until this sub standard 'company' has its franchise removed. Depending on who they are mates with in the Govt, of course.",

After 45 mins, with no indication of where I am in the queue, I give up and try the mobility helpline. Same thing - so I give up after nearly 15 mins. \nDon\u2019t know what to do now, so will have to turn up at the station in the hope that they can get her on to an earlier train.

        "review_text": "The most frustrating experience from a train company by now. All I needed - to book a advance return ticket from London to Oxenholme with a bicycle reservation. How hard can it be?\n\nI tried to book the ticket 3 times using their web site. All 3 times I received an email \"All done\" and the next second an email \"Failure. We couldn't connect to the delivery service\". Not sure which delivery service they meant as I was choosing \"collect from train station\". \n\nIn my attempts I used 3 different payment options - Amex, MasterCard and PayPal. Amex refunds came through. MasterCard payment wasn't accepted at all (they probably knew something). PayPal refund hasn't arrived after more than a month. Support team was useless. They couldn't explain the reason of the failures and kept repeating that the refund was issued. I submitted a complain on their web site and never received any response from that team. Obviously, they are very busy.\n\nFinally I managed to book a ticket via their buggy mobile app, but without a bicycle reservation. Mobile app was just unable to add a bicycle reservation without any explanation. So, I ended up calling Avanti and after an hour of waiting, asked them to add a bicycle reservation manually. I was explained that there are no free bicycle reservations for that train. If only mobile app could tell that earlier... I agreed to re-book a ticket to the next train an hour later. After that I received a \"booking code\", which I'm now supposed to TELL someone on the train because in the mobile application I still see my old booking without the reservation. \nI feel, I'll need to buy a travel insurance for that journey...\n\nSpecial note for Avanti team, in case you ever read this message: my support request IDs are - AWC-WEB-0489651, AWC-WEB-0493127, AWC-WEB-0499630, AWC-WEB-1005767, AWC-CR-1005790.",

The train manager asked passengers to wear masks and to not occupy aisle seats.

Well done Avanti for protecting your staff, it is a shame you can\u2019t afford the same courtesy to your paying customers.\n\nIf you are still concerned about travelling during this pandemic, I would say DEFINITELY avoid Avanti and disregard any emails the company may send you about the part they\u2019re playing in making travelling by train safer.

Apparently, the catering crew had to get off so they could get a train home as the service was late.

On the approach to Preston station the announcer informed the company had cancelled a train mid journey (not for the first time this week I later learned) and the passengers would be joining our train.

I complained to the guard (first I had seen throughout the journey) who advised this had happened on an earlier day of the same week. On arrival at my destination another guard confirmed these practices. I highly recommend that anyone should find another method of travel due to these completely routine unsafe practices which may even be a case in law due to their breech in passenger safety. I have underlying health conditions and would not have purchased a ticket if I had known this company regularly makes a mockery of their purported social distancing. It was so over crowded that I'd have felt much safer on a plane which I had avoided as Avanti had boasted social distancing. Fortunately, I had extra masks and was able to layer up masks. Hopefully, my health will not be adversely compromised but will not feel safe until the Covid incubation period passes (I obtained a Negative PCR for the journey). Never again!!!!",

I tried again at 10:25 but this time didn't get as far as the lounge door before getting turned away as the lounge was busy. I can appreciate the lounge being full, but whats unacceptable is the sneering attitude I was met with by the staff who simply had no customer empathy.

The food and drink choice in the buffet car was equally as limited in addition to being over-priced and cheap in quality. And, the first class carriage I sat in was untidy and dirty.\n\nI wrote an email of complaint to Avanti thereafter and have just received a fob off response in which no meaningful apology or explanation was offered. So, I was extremely disappointed with the first class \u201cexperience\u201d on Avanti West Coast and will certainly never fork out the extra cash to pay for first class again. \n\nOh, and having to pay \u00a34 for a small (.33cl) bottle of beer at the first class \u201clounge\u201d at Euston was a further rip off.",

WiFi on both journeys was poor, either slow or occasionally just didn\u2019t work. They\u2019ve removed the weekend upgrade to First Class as they\u2019ve introduced a new Standard Premium class where you can upgrade for the previous prices of a first upgrade but without the service.

Avanti shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with this price hiking, especially during COVID. I travel regularly to and from London - Manchester. Was able to book up to six weeks in advance for cheap tickets. Now all the tickets are \u00a366 one way wether you buy now or in advance. I did a search for random tickets up to six weeks and all resulted in \u00a366.  If this is the direction Avanti are taking, then the government needs to look into their tactics. And passengers should seriously be looking elsewhere to travel. Avanti, now is your opportunity to explain what exactly is going on with your ticket pricing? Where are the advance cheap tickets? When will they be reinstated, if ever? Why are you charging full fares regardless of advance notice?",

This is simply because they have a policy that they do not issue refunds. What other company is allowed to keep money for services not received?! How is this even legal?!\n\nYou buy an item of clothing and provided it hasn't been worn, you are usually allowed to return it within a few weeks. There is a cooling-off period with things like buying a house or taking out a contract with a utility company. Why is Avanti allowed to keep people's money when travel plans change all the time?! Just because they put it in the terms & conditions and I should have read the small print? Does that make it fairer?!\n\nWhen I need to travel up there in future, I will make every effort to find a way that doesn't involve Avanti.",

The trains are even slower than they were under that rapacious, blond, grinning psychopath, Richard Branson, who will never fill the void where his soul should be whether grasping at trips to near-earth orbit or clumps of NHS flesh. Privatisation is obviously, to all but the most pathetic, desperate, obsequious sadomasochists, a con. Just when I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse, along come Avanti and even higher fares. As a suggestion- don\u2019t bother spending any money on marketing. You have the politicians and you have the monopoly. There\u2019s nothing that a nation of angry, servile zombies will do about it. Instead, give the money to charity, or your underpaid staff, and if that is too abhorrent to your withered and twisted sensibilities, paint all your standard carriages black (including the windows) and write \u201cPOORS\u201d and \u201cSCUM\u201d on them.

Seeing the situation we decided to cancel our trip. We lost our money for the hotel and the trip we booked but we felt assured that we will get our train tickets refunded. \n\nBut alas! we were absolutely wrong! We emailed Avanti,  called them and even went to the station to get our money back but to no avail. The customer rep never picks up the phone and the rep at the train counter said you can only do the refund online. There is no option for a refund on its website you either call or email. Why should we suffer all these hassle when it was fault at ur end. Such pathetic customer service. I am so angry at this point. You want to cheat and scam your customers. You want to make you customers sooo frustrated that they forget about the refund!!! I wish I could report you to the highest authority and cancel your service and save people from this harassment!!! I will definitely tweet about this. Such a terrible experience with no possibility of refund in sight!

Avanti felt like the miracle that I was wishing for and when I boarded the carriage, I have to say what a much better train it was. More comfortable, with fast chargers and toilets.

Refused to deal with me despite having my ticket ready whilst his colleague dealt with another customer. And then, after waiting for 3 minutes, smirked whilst telling me the barriers shut two minutes before departure so I missed my train and my evening engagement on the first night of lifted Covid restrictions 17 May. Complaint made to Avanti but no response.  The two worst train experiences I\u2019ve have ever had, and that includes travelling by train in the US.

        "review_text": "A dreadful service from a notorious company at an extortionate price. \u00a3230 paid for two first-class return tickets Birmingham-London, plus \u00a330 for the 'Two Together' card which gave us access to this discounted price, bought online weeks in advance. It turned out that we could have had the same for over sixty pounds less by buying standard tickets on the day and upgrading with no need for the 'Two Together' card.\n\nAs it happens the 'First Class' benefits were precisely nil. Do not invest in this with Avanti. The First Class lounge at Birmingham is shut at weekends; at Euston it is a waiting area with no facilities beyond the toilet and a TV, with a toddlers' party-style goodie bag to take away. In the First Class carriages there are a few snacks and soft drinks available, but these were actually served up to the whole train on the way down. \n\nThe First-class carriage itself (the only one on the return journey) is used by the staff as a social area. In ours, four staff chatted loudly and relentlessly for 90 minutes without looking around the rest of the train, making rest, reading or work impossible. The only other passenger in First Class eventually turned on a film playing at full volume and no member of staff intervened.\n\nAt no point on the outward journey were our tickets checked - not in the station at either end, nor on the train. There's a good chance you can travel into London for free, so don't bother buying those expensive advance tickets. They were checked on the return journey, but we saw no sign of the staff checking the rest of the train, and our discount card was not requested.\n\nThe trains did not follow the advertised times in either direction. The outward one was announced at the station to take 30 minutes longer than still advertised on the app; the one going back was cancelled and replaced by a slightly earlier one (again not notified on the app, and which anyone using the app would therefore have missed) which nonetheless arrived ten minutes later than the advertised one.\n\nThis is the most we've ever paid for this trip in years of making the journey, and it was without doubt the worst value for money. Remarks from several staff confirmed that Avanti is having its finances secured by the government and doesn't care about passenger experience, staff conditions or passenger revenue if it means paying staff to check tickets. Don't buy First Class; don't buy in advance; and if possible, don't use Avanti.",

Suffice to say a direct 4+ hr journey became 12+ hours incompetence fest even though in the end I prematurely abandoned my train journey for a taxi.\nI got my auto refund and after complaining and asking for an explanation and being fobbed off first with a 25% discount on a future ticket which upped to 50 then 100 when I kept rejecting it in favour of an explanation - I finally gave in.\nThen my gran died and I;'ve been forced - once again - as a non car owner - to put myself at the mercy of AVW. The comp ticket does not exist. I spent Friday messaging AWC - then on the phone with an AWC ticket sales guy who didn't seem to know how his company worked - promised to ring me back with a resolution but of course did not.\nThey excuse their incompetence by just saying covid covid covid - but they were crap before. They are just much much worse now at a time when people need basic competence and reliability more than ever. As well as the awful stress - I've been led a merry dance - ok - lets not be polite - I was just tricked, lied to and had more and more of my time wasted.\nHonestly - if there is a donkey cart available DO NOT TRAVEL WITH THIS COMPANY",

To cap it all, the train started traveling backwards at one point. I can only imagine what the uproar may have been, had the carriages been full. (only 5 passengers in my carriage). \nHowever, and no pun intended. There was one beacon of light at the end of the tunnel. \nI know that I am not supposed to name personnel, but I cannot praise highly enough, Mark, who took over as train manager at Crewe.  At least I think that it was Crewe, I was starting to lose the plot slightly by this time.  He is a credit to his employers. I think that he managed to speak personally to every passenger on the train, to keep us up to speed with what was happening and constantly apologizing to everyone for the delays etc. He also did his best for me and another couple of passengers to try and help us make our next scheduled train on time.

It is clear that they have major IT issues but are cynically sending me round in circles and trying to make me seem the guilty party and making me do all the leg work. \nFrom reading other complaints, I am not alone. And this is on top of cancelling a recent train and putting me on a different service that required I change at Preston, waiting for over an hour in a tier 3 COVID area and then putting me on a train with no seat reservation in a carriage that didn't look as if it had seen a cleaner in months. It is probably my fault that I am 62, have suffered pneumonia and have been trying to be responsible during this crisis by protecting myself and others.\nI think these issues, replicated so often, need to brought to higher level of awareness.",

However, only Avanti West Coast know about it, and the customer is not informed by Avanti at any stage during the online booking process. Avanti advised me that they would credit the money in 3-5 working days. I spoke to my bank who very kindly credited most of the deductions themselves, so that I could use my account again.

Shouts across the train platform to check if you have a train ticket ready, assuming you\u2019ll be a passenger on her train, when all you could be is just a passer-by on the platform. I have come across her on numerous train journeys inside the train, conducting ticket checks. Proper jobs-worth but what bothers me is her rudeness and the way she approaches her ticket-check task. Clearly no people-skills in the way she talks and comes across. She shouted across the platform checking if I had a ticket but I ignored her, as I wanted her to get the message that it isn\u2019t ok for her to do that. As I carried on walking to the bench, she shouted again saying excuse me, but being rude and abrupt. \n\nIf Avanti want to save their fast-dropping reputation, they would help themselves a great deal of loss of reputation by sacking this rude job\u2019s worth of a lady who clearly talks down on people. This personal experience of mine isn\u2019t the first time I noticed her being rude. A passenger who sat on the opposite side of the train isle, casually once spoke to me saying she\u2019s rude, so there you go Avanti. Bloody do something about her before I keep escalating and escalating as I don\u2019t tolerate rude people like her getting away.",

Worst customer service I\u2019ve ever received and they lie to say this is due to pandemic and they\u2019ve taken over Virgin when clearly it\u2019s just the staffs incompetence (I ordered months after they took over Virgin) DO NOT ORDER FROM THEIR WEBISTE, ALWAYS USE THIRD PARTY WEBSITES",

Tried online chat...timed out before being connected! Then spoke to an agent on the phone after getting their number from Google,  Agent was polite, but ultimately unable to do anything given the circumstances of bad systems, he couldn't even process via their telephone payment method. And to be fair sounded like a new recruit maybe to deal with current high demand. Read an earlier review here (thank you) - headed for their old website (still working), booked no problem, but doesn't allow you to choose seats. \n\nNew website and payments set up a complete disaster!! Chap I spoke to said my 5 payments totaling \u00a3350 will be refunded within 2 days.\n\nNever had any problems with Virgin!!! Please come back (if only to run their bookings!).\n\nAn hour and half later... farewell. Happy Christmas!",

Lot of problems with new website: Accounts were not transfered: I had to create a new password to access my account, yet when I managed to log on the old website (which I still had in browser history, and it's still on) I logged in using my old password meaning the accounts were not transfered. between both website they changed the acceptance rules for passwords so lot of people will have the same issue.\nThe new website crashes everytitime when you reach the step where you chose how to get your ticket (print, digital, post) and doesn't allow you to proceed with ticket purchasing. Also despite warnings saying you need a reservation to travel Liverpool to London it doesn't give you any option to reserve a seat. No way I could get a ticket on the new website, good thing the old one is still on.If you have the same issue with the new website use the old one at:\nhttps://www.\nbuytickets.avantiwestcoast.co.uk\n/buytickets\n/advancedsearch.aspx",

Eventually flew to London at a fraction of the price. The reason for this review after such a delay is because today I decided maybe try out Avanti again thinking surely they must have improved. However I\u2019ve just read the reviews in this site and thank you to all in helping me decide to never use Avanti again ( worst service we ever had, dirty trains, bad food, rude staff) compared to Virgin  whom we used for years. \nA final thought if this is customer service I have concerns over the unseen maintenance and engineering issues with regard to the rolling stock!",

I had booked to travel somewhere but my trip was cancelled (not by Avanti) so I rung up customer services - who don't have a clue what they're doing, both calls I had were extremely painful. I first asked to get a refund, which wasn't possible but I was offered an amendment which allowed me to change the date and time of my tickets up to 6 months later. I ended the call to check with my partner when he would like to change our trip for and rung back up. I was on the phone for 50 minutes in total, I told the agent the new date I wanted to travel but was told I couldn't book anything later than 6 weeks of todays date. I then asked to book something 6 weeks from today and was told I couldn't as the new price was \u00a31 less than my original. After about 15 minutes we found a date of the exact same price so I asked to change the tickets but I was asked for my bank details to book a new pair, as I would then be refunded my original transaction BUT I would be charged \u00a310 per ticket per person for admin fee which was the price of my tickets! I asked to speak to a manager, the agent went to get one and 10 minutes later said someone would call me back. The day of my travel went and I am no longer entitled to change my tickets. No one has called me back and it's been over a week. Save yourself the hassle and pain and just pay a bit extra with another provider.",

A woman in the same coach, who sat 2 rows behind me in seat 24 was wearing a face mask when she boarded the train, but removed it on sitting in her seat, and continued not to wear any form of face covering or mask for the duration of her journey. Instead the face covering she had been wearing when boarding was blatantly on the table in front of her. I raise the issue with the Train Manager who said he couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation other than make announcements about it wearing face coverings!!! I am very much anti- confrontation, but feel polite face to face reminders may go along way. The Train Manager refused to remind the offender about the legal requirement to wear a face covering!!! Beyond belief!!! What is the point of employing Train Managers if they cannot even try and enforce the law for the safety of all your passengers. Some of your staff appear to choose to have total disregard for current laws and the safety of your passengers. Very worrying in these times. If we all chose to defy the law your company would not be operating. \ud83e\udd14",

        "review_text": "TL;DR All the gripes you had with Virgin trains are still present. Best to set up an online account first and purchase your tickets through your account. If you purchase as a guest, later changes must be handled by their unbearably inefficient call centre.\n\nAvanti took over Virgin's west coast service. Same old trains that we've had for the last 20 years. Same horrendous prices which, being fair, is true for all UK train companies. \n\nSame cramped conditions. If you're six foot or taller, you're better off booking in first class; standard class will be hell on your knees unless you get a table seat with no passenger sitting opposite.\n\nIf you're in the unfortunate case of having to use their service, I strongly suggest signing up for an online account. It makes things so much easier and quicker to process refunds and amendments to your ticket.\n\nIf you purchase a ticket online as a guest, you have to call them. No option online to change things. \n\nPoorly trained call centre staff, tiresome barrage of information which is better handled by having online. If you're pushed for time (and patience), it's a nightmare. \n\nWhilst the waiting time in a queue was mercifully short, the call with their operator took 25 minutes. The person I spoke with didn't know the procedure for processing refunds and had to check with a colleague. \n\nYou have to start the booking process again - what carriage do you prefer, what seat facing do you prefer, etc. - and then my operator advised of the procedure in full.\n\nIt's unacceptable for a large company to be unable to handle routine transactions (refunds and ticket amendments) online unless: 1. you set up an online account in the first instance; and 2. you book the ticket(s) via your account in the first instance. \n\nIf you buy your ticket as a guest and then need to make changes later on, it's absurd that you have to contact their call centre.\n\nThis would be understandable 20 years ago. In 2020, regardless of COVID-19, it's unforgivable.\n\nEDIT: Surprise, surprise. The call centre operator said I'd get the new ticket by email. I didn't.",

        "review_text": "I used to travel from London to Glasgow once a month pre-Covid on a Thursday night to a Sunday morning for work on a Friday in London and then a weekend stay in London. Return ticket costs have doubled for the journey, particularly for the Sunday morning (8.47am) return to Glasgow. Every time I booked with Virgin (and initially with Avanti) I used to be able to book a Thursday evening train down for probably \u00a333 and then the return to Glasgow for Sunday morning for \u00a333-\u00a345. However now the ticket back to Glasgow every month on a Sunday morning that I look for is \u00a3105, this is the slower 5hr 18 mins service. No sign of an advance ticket at all no matter how early or late I look to book my tickets. Now I travel home on Sunday with LNER to Edinburgh and get Scot Rail from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Not much difference in travel time and I get to stretch my legs at Edinburgh before I jump on Scot Rail trip. Ticket is still half the price of Avanti and that is for an LNER and a Scot Rail ticket. What is going on Avanti as there is no logic to this nearly triple increase in price for an early Sunday morning train. You have lost me as a customer as the LNER trains are nicer, better view out the window on East Coast and still get home to Glasgow at the same time. I will only travel with you now on the late weekday services down to London as that seems to be the only services you still have maintained a reasonable price.",

Now the problem is the outward journey is an advance ticket so under normal circumstance I get it that you can not get a refund but you can change.  These are not normal circumstances as going to liverpool next month would be classed as a none essential journey and I do not know when to rebook as I do not know when liverpool will come out of it.  Tried to explain this in a nice way to Avanti and kindly ask for a refund on this occasion.  Blunt answer NO as it per t and c blah blah.  And according to them they are following the government guide lines when they are not as they as they say I can still go in October but I pointed out I am unable to do so as it is not an essential journey and unable to stay at my mothers house as that would be breaking the law.  Looks like avanti are behind with the law and the Gov advice.  I am upset as it is not seeing my dad for his birthday as he has dementia and do not know how long he has left.

This is very inconvenient for me because my lift at tamworth can no longer pick me up so I\u2019m going to have to get a taxi which means even more money. \n\nI\u2019m not happy about this at all.

Previously on Virgin, I could book a direct return for around \u00a340-45, which isn\u2019t awful. Expensive, but not terribly so.\n\nHowever, Avanti have decided to run fewer services, and also break their trains up, so my journey now consists of an Avanti service to Crewe, a 30 minute layover, and then either a Trains for Wales service (rarely) or a replacement bus (1hr) from Crewe to Chester. This brings my journey from Virgin\u2019s 1hr30m at \u00a340-45, to Avanti\u2019s 3hr20m journey with the pleasant and unpredictable price range of anywhere between \u00a355-100.\n\nTrain fares follow the GDP inflation rate, and as of this year went up 2%. What do Avanti have to show for it? A slow, broken up and unreliable experience which profiteers off of a privatised monopoly.\n\nYou might as well drive for the amount of time and cost of fuel, rather than use the train. Flights between Luton & Manchester international are also a cost-friendly option.",

Booking via Trainline turned up slightly better value tickets, costing \u00a3126 two weeks in advance.\n\nDespite the high prices and virtually empty trains, service is much diminished due to Covid 19 restrictions. While staff were, on the whole, pleasant and helpful, the food and refreshments expected in first class were either absent to not up to standard. My cooked breakfast, for instance, was stuffed clumsily into a small cardboard box, a centimetre deep in liquid. \n\nMost other meals are reduced to pre-packed snacks, and staff seem reluctant to make more than one attempt to offer refreshments. Given that on my trip (before 9 a.m. on a weekday) there were only four passengers in the entirety of first class, I have to assume that staff spent much of the two hour journey at rest.\n\nWhile allowances must be made for current extraordinary circumstances, it is difficult to excuse a company that appears to want to charge more for less, or to excuse such indifferent service.",

        "review_text": "Truly atrocious. I mean truly atrocious. I have been travelling regularly (4 times a month) up and down the West Coast mainline between Liverpool and London since the late 1990's, so I would like to think I am in a position to offer informed feedback.\nFirstly, the OBSCENE PRICE INCREASES this company has implemented since taking over are a DISGRACE. I could regularly book Virgin return tickets in advance for less than \u00a360 if travelling off peak. The cheapest this thieving corporate outfit offer is over \u00a390. And that's booking over two months in advance.\nSecondly, I don't know what training they have given to their staff, but I have never come across such RUDE and damn right HOSTILE staff as what this outfit has working for them, I think they would prefer to travel with no passengers.\nThirdly, NOTHING HAS IMPROVED SINCE AVANTI TOOK OVER, IT'S A LOT WORSE. The same repugnant smell in certain carriages!!!!!!\nI, with regret moaned a little about Virgin Trains in the past, but after experiencing ten journeys with Avanti, Virgin Trains were miles better, at least the average person could afford to travel on them.\nIt is a scandal that people who have to travel to and from London on a regular basis are being HELD TO RANSOM, and having to endure WORSENING STANDARDS in the process.\n\u00a390 for a return journey that could be bought for less than \u00a360 under the previous franchise is an outright SCANDAL!!!!!!!!!\nI STRONGLY advise people to find alternative transport if you are able to, whether that be car, plane or bus. \nHowever if you are ok with being RIPPED OFF, treated with contempt on a train that regularly smells of rotten eggs, or have no other option then go ahead and book your tickets with Avanti West Coast, CORPORATE THIEVING OUTFIT.\nIs it really too much to ask for a train service priced reasonably with good offers for advanced off peak booking, with carriages that did not smell rancid (especially in the heat), and staff who actually valued their passengers. Is that really too much to expect?\nDespite their faults, Virgin were so much better.",

        "review_text": "Travelled first class London to Glasgow, 4 people, (me and three children), on 22 July. We were sent an e mail message the evening before announcing that we would not be served any kind of food or refreshments due to COVID. This is to help STOP the spread of the disease. Instead we could walk the full length of the train to coach C to stand in a line and collect complimentary crisps and chocolate from the shop. I wonder how can this be safer than serving anyone at their seat. Its not. I also wonder why I paid the full cost of first class tickets for something that is clearly not first class. While I'm wondering, I wonder why restaurants, cafes and pubs have and had, at that point, reopened and managing to serve food/drinks. At the point of booking the website still advertised the usual service in first class. I would not have booked it otherwise. I raised this during an online discussion with 'Customer Service'. The person there let me know that I was paying for the many other perks - leg room, as far as I could gather. I was with 3 children, leg room is not an issue. Traipsing to the opposite end of the train with 3 children behind you to collect 'complimentary' crisps and chocolate because we've only just been informed the night before an early train that food won't be an option, on such a long journey, most definitely is.\nI basically paid well over \u00a3100 more for complimentary crisps and chocolate. Avanti, you need to take a look at your ticket price and make adjustments. Its probably worth adding that the online adviser gave me an email address to complain to and request a refund, I asked how likely is it that I will get some kind of refund. He told me that because of the type of ticket I have I will not be given a refund. That's not customer service Avanti, that's just annoying people.",

So apparently it is more safe to make customers walk through 6 carriages of people from the top of the train to get a chocolate bar? The 'first-class' toilet had no toilet roll, the train was grubby and staff arrogant. The toilets were vomit-inducing in terms of smells that my partner was actually sick. Why are they charging full whack for first class when the only benefit is a bigger seat and access to a table? They do not have to pay for staff, supplies and or loo roll by the looks of things. There was also no first-class wifi. \n\nI have been in touch and been given a similar response to the other complaints - 'I regret to inform you that we cannot offer any recompense'....\n\nI am so infuriated that I am actually considering reporting them to the rail ombudsman as communicating with them is like trying to get blood through a stone.

        "review_text": "I paid to travel 1st Class to Birmingham and back on the 31/07/20. The service was appalling. No announcements regarding no drinks served to table or that complimentary drinks were available in coach C. This being on the hottest day of the year so far. There was no air conditioning in carriage J where my ticket was booked for or in the next carriage K. It was stifling and unbearable to say the least and the temperature was in excess of +30 degrees. Again no announcement about the problem. Delayed by over 20 minutes as well with no apology. I travel to Birmingham a lot and never had these issues when Virgin were operating the service. I received a derisory response from them fobbing me off. AVOID THESE COWBOYS AT ALL COSTS.\n\nFirstly, I am sorry to hear of the delay you experienced when travelling from Birmingham New Street to London Euston. I wanted to let you know that you may be eligible for Delay Repay compensation if you were delayed by 15 minutes or more. To submit a claim for this, just head here.\nWe won't be able to consider any Delay Repay compensation from here in the Customer Resolutions Centre, as claims can only be processed by our dedicated Delay Repay team at the above link. But of course we are here to help with your other comments or concerns.\nPlease note, Delay Repay claims must be submitted within 28 days of the affected journey and the quickest way to receive any compensation you may be due is by completing the form as above.\nI'm sorry to hear there were problems with the air conditioning during your journey. I understand this must've been uncomfortable.\nThere is equipment onboard to monitor and regulate air temperature. When faults occur, the Train Manager will always do what they can to make the journey comfortable for everyone onboard.\nWe'll pass on your comments to the Customer Experience Manager for your route. I have checked our records for services running that day and I cannot locate a report of a fault with the air conditioning on the service that you had travelled on so I will also report the air conditioning problem to our Fleet teams to get it fixed. They look after the maintenance of all our trains.\nI understand that you are also unhappy at the lack of a catering service onboard. As a response to Covid-19 we have temporarily suspended our at seat service to minimise possible spread of the virus, and this information is available on our website for information before travel. Whilst catering services are suspended, I can see you did enjoy the other perks of First Class travel such as extended legroom, a table at your seat and power sockets at ever seat. On the basis of this, on this occasion we cannot offer a refund as a response to your complaint. I do apologise for any disappointment caused.\nThanks for getting in touch again. I appreciate that my response may not have been the one that you were hoping for, but I hope that my email has explained our position.",

        "review_text": "Hi.  The Avanti  website  makes it clear that people from the same household  can  sit together. A member of staff  at the local  station  said  it would be a good thing,  to  save space. So,  when attempting  to  reserve  two  seats,  next to  each other (the other person  has to  sit with me for medical reasons)  I  was told:\n1.    We cannot  do  that  -  despite  what the website says.   Then, I  provided  written  evidence:  that was ignored.   I  have to  say that the two  female  staff members  were  wonderful,  but  couldn't resolve the situation;  the  male  member  of staff  was  quite rude.  He  was caught  out  when I  showed him  what the website  said  -  no  apology  from him,  after his  disgruntled response.  \n2.    I  was told  I needed to  be under two  weeks before  the date of travel  -  we are  under  two  weeks  easily.  I  pointed out the  obvious x3  -  I was ignored.   \n3.    The  reservation  of the seats  is apparently  essential,  yet  I  have spent two  days on this.  Nothing.  I  sent an  email  to the  Avanti  support team,  as a matter of urgency.  No  proper  reply  -  just  an acknowledgement.  No  action.  No  resolution.   \n \nThe trip  is put at risk  -  losing them  over  \u00a3200  at least.   They can't use  Covid-19  as an  excuse:  it's a basic transaction  -   not  remotely  difficult  to  set  up.  So  much for 'high-tech  blah  blah...\nNot happy.",

This was on the 25 March, when everything was being cancelled due to Covid-19 and customer services were overwhelmed with claims. There was no phone support and their website pleaded costumers to cancel online and only contact them in emergencies. I did so, I waited for almost 2 months for the refund, and now I emailed them. They are now saying that the refund period (30 days) has expired and that I should have emailed them before. It seems that their website could not cope with the amount of cancellations that were being processed that week, and mine did not register. Back then they asked for clients understanding and flexibility, not they are pointing at their T&Cs. Shame on them!",

The Governments Emergency Measures Agreement with the Rail Companies included measures to provide fee-free refunds on all advanced tickets.  This means the tax payer is footing the bill. I repeatedly attempted to claim my refund on-line, as I have an account with Avanti. The on-line systems would not permit me to claim.  I wrote to the CEO as the customer service is based overseas and the operators have poor English. Eventually, I received an email from Avanti confirming they owe me \u00a3143.80 and requested payment details.  Then they change their mind, I need to send a photograph of the tickets, before they pay me. I send a photograph to Avanti but it was not good enough, so for clarity I sent a pdf copy to the CEO and heard nothing. I am not surprised, because it is the same CEO and Customer Service Operators that worked for Virgin West Coast which was not very impressive or efficient.  Avanti have failed to comply with their complaints procedure by failing to contact me. Don't blame COVID-19 for your failings",

I took a picture of the actual tickets and the credit card receipt and emailed them.  The reply was \"can't find the booking now\".  Seriously?!  What more do they need?

We were told but the train announcer that we were entitled to a refund of a percentage of our fares for both journeys as coming back the metro had finished for the night as the train was so late and we had to get a taxi from Manchester to Bury . We have filled in all the pit paperwork and sent copies of our tickets and they keep replying invalid claim and they aren\u2019t taking any telephone calls and their online chat service isn\u2019t running .

I had planned a trip from the US to London for a year for late March but, of course, it was canceled with the global pandemic! I had bought round trip  First Class train tickets for a day trip from London to Liverpool. I have tried many times with back and forth messages to get a refund or credit ... I started doing so well before the day we were to take the train trip to no avail and my last correspondence with them today said my message was BLOCKED! There was not an option to rebook the tickets as no one knows when it will be safe to travel again and their online calendar does not extend out that far for a possible fall travel date!!! I was able to get credit for everything else I had booked without the difficulty this company has shown. I do hope to be able to reschedule the trip for later in the fall and would still like to be able to go to Liverpool, I just wish there was some other sensible means of getting there from London for a day trip than having to deal with this company! I certainly won\u2019t be foolish enough to buy First Class tickets again!",

        "title": "They Pretent To Support Stranded Flybe Passengers But Don't Deliver",
        "review_text": "I was stranded in Ireland by the Flybe collapse and had to fly with a different airline to Gatwick rather than Manchester. I therefore had to take a train between the two points. So as not to be stranded or pay last minute prices, I booked immediately after the collapse. Avanti, along with other carriers, then came out with a kind offer of free travel for affected passengers for a period. I acknowledge that Avanti allegedly offered this until 11th March however multiple travel websites confirmed they were doing it until either the 12th or 15th. To their credit, railway staff at Gatwick, Victoria and Euston allowed me to board the train for free on the strength of my Flybe confirmation. This was on 12th March, the original date I was meant to fly. Had I not been proactive and booked a ticked in a crisis situation, I would have been allowed to travel on a complimentary basis. Frontline staff were very kind and helpful.\n\nIn view of not needing to use the ticket purchased in an emergency situation, I applied to Avanti to refund it as it had not been used or otherwise stamped. They insisted that the gesture had expired on 11th March and refused to offer either a refund or a travel voucher. This was unbelievably narrow minded and confirmed an empty gesture to stranded passengers. I appealed and was again declined and Avanti refused to escalate the matter. I managed to identify the personal e mail address of Philip Whittingham, the Managing Director of Avanti, and I appealed to him for a few to be taken, on compassionate grounds if nothing else. I received a reply from one of Mr Whittingham's staff, declining to help and insisting that the alleged expiration date of the rescue offer was being rigidly enforced, regardless of reputable travel websites stating otherwise. So much for the attempt by Avanti to claim positive publicity by reaching out to stranded passengers.\n\nUnbeknown to Mr Whittingham I am a professional assessor and reviewer in the hospitality and travel industry, as well as being a travel planner to a personal portfolio of clients. I publish widely and advertise on an international level. The closed minded view of Avanti and the Managing Director's Office has resulted in extremely negative feedback and the removal of Avanti from all recommendations. This action will likely cost the company significantly more than the positive consequences of them acting with honour.",

What sort of refund policy is this? What a joke! After they asked me in a contact form to provide every detail in the book, almost two months and no answer from them. This is beyond disgusting for a replacement train company that by the looks of it is going to be even worse than its precedessor. Dont use them! and specially dont wait for either a reply from them or a full refund. It seems they too charge a stupid administration fee to deal with your refund. They are to blame but whoever allowed this disgrace is even more to blame. Trading standards and Which? should investigate this. Train companies cannot be allowed not to issue a full refund for ticket which are cancelled way in advance fom the departure date, NOT MATTER WHAT!",

This is an organisation who, despite government advice against non-essential travel, coupled together with the cancellation of all shows, concerts, conferences and exhibitions due to Coronavirus, REFUSE to temporarily amend their terms and conditions regarding refunds on Advanced tickets. \n\nInstead, they are forcing customers like myself to either lose their money or re-book a journey for a future date, thus forcing you to pay any difference in ticket prices. Most people don't want to travel on an alternative date, or if they do, have no idea whether government restrictions will allow them to at this moment in time.\n\nHowever, they refuse to budge on this and the responses I have seen on Twitter from their customer service team are simply  unhelpful and verging on rudeness in many cases.\n\nMany other companies, for example Premier inn, LNER and Hilton are temporarily relaxing their T&Cs to allow refunds or credit vouchers on normally non refundable bookings. This is the honourable thing to do and will be respected by their customers in the coming year or so as things return to normal.\n\nAvanti should simply hang their head in shame at making money out of customers in these times of exceptional circumstances. Customers have good memories and I suspect this refusal to move on their position will cost them dearly in the future. \n\nI now have to decide whether to pay more to book tickets for an unwanted journey or simply lose my money completely through no fault of my own. As someone on a low-ish income who is classed as a key worker in this current outbreak, it sickens me to the stomach.",

        "review_text": "Being a relatively regular user over the past few years of the London Euston to Glasgow service, I was intrigued to hear that Virgin had lost out to a new service, Avanti, on the new franchise.\n\nHowever within a few trips with Avanti, I can confidently say that there has been a significant deterioration in both service and value for money. \n\nI typically travel in 1st class to use the wifi, which somehow seems to have gotten less reliable, and it has become very clear that there have been cost cutting measures. The food service seems to have been reduced to essentially a sandwich, and the few remaining hot options have significantly reduced in quality. I thought perhaps this might have just been a bad journey initially, but after a few repeated experiences, I can say that the food is now poor to inedible. I'd advise bringing your own which somewhat defeats the point of buying a 1st class ticket. It is no longer a premium service.\n\nIn terms of onboard service, I'm not sure if it is just training or standards control, but there seems to be less emphasis put on customer care. This was always a highlight of Virgin, their onboard teams were consistently very helpful and went out of their way, even in difficult circumstances, to provide great service. By contrast, onboard staff with Avanti seem uninterested in customers and much less proactive. This has been the case on multiple trips now so I think it is a consistent feature of the Avanti model.\n\nFinally on value for money, alongside the issues mentioned above which seem to suggest cost cutting measures, the prices seem to have dramatically increased partly due to much reduced chance of a potential discount from purchasing in advance. With Virgin, if you were able to plan your trip a few weeks in advance then you were usually able to get a return for \u00a3150 or less, often sub \u00a3100. With Avanti, you seem to get \"On the day\" prices, even when looking months in advance. I once paid less with Virgin \"on the day\" than I did with Avanti 3 weeks ahead of my trip. For the first time in 4 years, I regularly consider flights now when making this journey as I cannot justify the cost to myself with the poor quality service on Avanti trains. \n\nThe best I can hope is that these are teething issues that will be resolved over the length of the contract, however they have the hallmarks of cost cutting measures which does not bode well. Firstgroup has a reputation in Scotland for cost cutting instead of competing on quality and it is a shame to see that extended to this route. The contrast with Virgin could not be more clear and I hope they take customer satisfaction into account in the future when considering the awarding of franchises as often the \"cheapest\" option comes back to bite you with additional cost down the line. In this case with less people choosing to travel this route due to the operator.",

When they did he arranged for them to bring it back to International, and looked after it  so I could pick up later . He was cheerful throughout and really put me at ease. The relief was immense. Really does deserve some employee recognition . Restored my faith in our railway network which hasn't always been easy over the last year or so. Thank you Jason and hope you see this !!",

An announcement at Manchester Piccadilly clearly stated that passengers for the 19.56 train should disembark at Milton Keynes and take a replacement bus service to Euston. The replacement bus service can accurately be described as falling between inadequate and non-existent. Rail Network said they had not been informed about any replacement service and that Avanti are not contactable on Sundays. This is astounding; if you are responsible for a major rail connection, how is it even conceivable that you are out of contact on any day of the week? Avanti should be prepared to take a substantial hit in terms of fully reimbursing customers for poor service and a lack of transparency. It is unacceptable for passengers to be left stranded on a platform in Milton Keynes at midnight on a Sunday with no travel information.",

Virgin trains, yeah they weren't perfect, but they were leaps and bounds better than Avanti!\n\nThis review was made possible by CrossCountry's Wi-Fi - sorry Avanti, theirs actually works!!!",

Cheaper price offered by Trainline even when taking into account the booking fee. Price difference was enormous, i.e., \u00a357.30 on Avanti's official web versus \u00a318.50 on the trainline website. Absolutely outrageous. How can Avanti justify this rip off action. You think by booking directly with the train company, you would be given the cheaper rate. Within a couple of hours of researching the prices, the price went up again on the Avanti website. Suggest choosing a cheaper option rather than feed the pockets of this rip off company!!!\nIf possible I would award a minus rating for this shoddy train company!!,",

We were four people travelling from Glasgow to Preston, we requested a table seat so we would be sat together and they sat us on two separate airline seats, one facing forward the other backwards, it was impossible to chat as a group.  I cannot believe there wasn't a table seat when we booked over 10 weeks ago. On Virgin Trains website you could choose your seats, I would even pay extra to book preferred seats if necessary.  We had spent a lovely weekend away together and seating us separately did dampen our spirits.",

        "review_text": "THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER USED - BRING BACK VIRGIN\n\nOriginally booked for 2 weekend's ago however due to circumstances this was changed to 22-23 Feb 20 (well in advance may I also add). Having Paid \u00a3160 for first class tickets and then an extra \u00a340 to change dates once on the Train realised the re-issued tickets where in fact standard. Having complained to the train manager this was quickly resolved and we relaxed into the journey.\n\nOn our return the next day we desperately tried to change our advance tickets to an earlier train as a family member was rushed to hospital however we was met with the most unhelpful and patronising staff at EUSTON station I have EVER come across. Yes I understand these can't usually be changed and in order to do this we needed to pay a substantial fee however we simply didn't have \u00a3100 extra to spend on more tickets. Just to make it home we was actually quite happy to be sat in Standard in order to just get home but quite frankly Avanti doesn't have ANY staff members with compassion or a heart and are like robots using the line \"You will need to speak to customer relations\" but yet when you ring the number provided states it re-opens MONDAY - WHAT USE IS THIS????\n\nTo make matters worse and really add the cherry on the top, once sat in our empty first class carriage, the train manager, who I explained our ticket situation to and showed all email correspondence etc with proof of first class purchase etc still demanded we paid an extra \u00a350 to stay in the carriage. His words simply ahh well it looks like they've upgraded you to standard so you need to pay. HOW CAN YOU UPGRADE TO STANDARD IF IN FIRST CLASS????? The best phrase to come out of his mouth however \"I can't just let you sit here as all these people have paid\" - This is after us showing him the \u00a3200 we have paid to sit in first to simply be issued the wrong tickets.\n\nSo Avanti, Euston Avanti Staff and train manager on the 20.25 from EUSTON - PRESTON - I hope you feel much better on your high horses and I really hope for the sake of other passengers you learn some human decency - Please bring Virgin back to this line.",

After struggling to get the ticket I asked Craig did he really need to see the ticket, simply told to read Avanti terms and conditions. Did he really need to see it, shouldn\u2019t Craig have taken into consideration the many people behind us trying to catch the train, surly it would make sense to check it on the train, as it always has been in the past? \n\nThink it would be helpful for Avanti to reconsider this process, might just give a better customer experience",

Once on train the staff were there quickly to get me a drink, yes, and offer of cold food but opted to wait for the hot post Preston.  The fish pie and cheese were both good though portion size a little smaller than Virgin. Staff were friendly the whole way down and back the following day.  Both trains were delayed due to the bad weather but we were kept fully up to date and as we were late into London on way down there was an extra stop at Watford for those passengers for whom this was more convenient.  There have clearly been a lot of bad experiences but mine was good.",

I\u2019ve travelled the west coast line for 3 years, twice a week from top to toe; I use Southern, Northern and GWR regularly but I have never thought that they were better services than Virgin. However, with the advent of Avanti taking over, in Dec19, I have drastically reappraised that consideration. Your ticket app - although just a hijack of Virgin doesn\u2019t work (I have to buy my tickets using the Northern app and they have been sequestered from their franchise ). Your delay repay process reminds me of that experienced by the old lady in the film The Invincibles. Your trains, in my experience, are always late and you haven\u2019t updated your films since December. The final straw is that you have stopped trains, the through train to London, picking up passengers at OXN at the weekend and we have to go via Birmingham. This adds an hour onto the journey- and yes I can go via Preston but this also adds an hour to my journey. I look forward to when the franchise is taken off you and returned to a competent rail operator. God, it can\u2019t be too soon. Best wishes have a pleasant journey- while it last.",

All the way through the journeys both there and back seats were showing as available. Also both trains didn\u2019t run on time, you could also smell the toilets in the carriage, which I never experienced under Virgin. Only staff member I saw on the train also was the girl serving in the buffet carriage, train manager made their announcements but didn\u2019t even bother to come and check tickets So all in all first journey on Avanti (ridiculous name) wasn\u2019t great, you have very big shoes to fill!

Virgin was a forward looking, progressive company with a refreshing outlook and focus on customer service. Gone are the reasonably priced advance tickets along with the cheery staff and excellent first class service. Avant west coast has somehow managed to reverse the last 20+ years of progression and almost taken us back to the dark old gloomy days of British Rail. The staff seem lost as to what they are doing, the trains look dirty inside and neglected. The WiFi doesn\u2019t work and no one can be bothered to fix it. Travelling in first class used to be a great experience, it\u2019s now an overcrowded sham with third class service. Then there is the dreary branding that shows a total lack of imagination. RIP Virgin trains. Let\u2019s hope that we see you rise again through HS2 one day...",

        "review_text": "On the 7th of January I travelled from Birmingham New Street on the 10.10pm train to Euston. My ticket was for Birmingham New Street to Southampton Central. The ticket inspector/train manager acknowledged that i was travelling on to Waterloo because he told me that the ticket could be used on the underground.\n\nHowever, the train pulled into Euston late. I fretted and walked down to the front of the train..no staff were on hand as they were about to finish their shift (in fact they were ALL sat in the 1st class section together). \n\nI attempted to catch the only Underground train that connected to Waterloo but missed it!! My heart sank and I had a full on panic attack when I realised I was stuck in London overnight. No staff member helped me - and I am disabled so this made matters worse.\n\nIn the morning (04.30am) I was at Waterloo station as it opened...and had to pay a further \u00a330 odd pound to get another ticket. When I sent an online complaint to Avanti West Coast it took them ages to respond...only to say they had contacted Cross Country Trains because I purchased my tickets via their site.\n\nAvanti West Coast please get your act together...the above should not have happened. I am a 63 yr old woman with disabilities and kept being approached in London for money overnight...this was so scary....I am taking this as far as I can because Avanti West Coast need to acknowledge that if their trains are late and passengers cannot make their connection they should deal with it instead of making excuses and fobbling people off!!!!",

        "review_text": "Avanti has ruined this service. Virgin used to be fantastic for years - in-train service was always great & automatic delay repay went straight to your account within a week without any additional effort. \n\nAvanti first class has very little of the old menu available at the weekend, just a prepackaged sandwich in a box and tea/coffee. Most of the soft drinks and fruit juices / fruit / snacks has disappeared or has \"run out\".\n\nAvanti makes it very hard to get delay repay. You need a second account for just the \"delay repay\" area of their site, then to manually \"Opt-in\". It is not automatic repayment, it's more of an automatic \"notification\" which forgets about multiple tickets for a journey, so it only offers refund of one of the multiple tickets you buy for a journey. \n\nI had to perform the manual process of entering all the ticket details, find all the reference numbers, upload them all in one image. Even after giving them all this information they still ask you to find the journey with dates and times and changes etc. Perhaps the icing on the cake (though Avanti cakes probably wouldn't have icing) is in the email confirmation of your claim \"We will respond to your claim within 20 working days\" - yawn.\n\nIt certainly feels like they have made it so difficult that most people will just give-up, either getting confused by the multiple-accounts, unable to use the software, or simply by trying not to waste any more of their time.\n\nUnbelievable the amount of effort required to get your repayment now, especially considering only a few months ago it would happen automatically with zero effort on Virgin. What a shame to see a fantastic public transport route go down the drain.",

I really don\u2019t see what harm it could possibly do if some of the adults were to get on one stop later.

        "review_text": "Have travelled Avanti regularly twice weekly since their take over in December.\n\nTheir service in the week is spot on, and very comparable to Virgin Trains. \n\nTheir 1st Class service at the weekend is slightly worse than Virgin, with less, and no hot food options available. However the ticket price is lower generally at the weekend, so it\u2019s hardly unreasonable for the same options as in the week.\n\nAs a regular traveller between Glasgow and London, the high speed direct service remains more reliable than flying, and in terms of cost still leaves you between off after factoring travel to the airport. \n\nHave had one major delay of 90 minutes, which the full ticket price was automatically refunded within a week. \n\nOther than this it\u2019s practically the same as Virgin. For long distance travel between Caledonia and the South it\u2019s the best option for doing so in 4 hours and 30 minutes. Comparing to a drive of around 8 hours with a couple of rest stops. \n\nI feel a lot of the bad reviews are down to customers expecting the Orient Express, especially for trips in their own time. - Be realistic. \n\nFor those that need to travel down the WCML for work and to get home, Avanti do the job.\n\nMy only hate is the lack to choose where to sit when booking online. Please bring that back!!\n\nServices I generally travel on; \n19:30 to GLC on Friday night\n13:38 to EUS on Sunday Afternoon",

Bearing in mind that virtually every time I travelled with Virgin Trains the service was on time or a few minutes early, the performance of Avanti is abysmal (and they've only had the service for just under two months).  The onboard service is mostly non-existent and booking seats is now a lot more difficult as they have removed the ability to select your own seat.  Ridiculous how in a very short space of time they have taken what was a great service run by Virgin Trains and turned it into a shambles.  But not a surprise, seeing as they have to cut costs massively in order to meet the pension liability commitments they have given.  Pathetic really.",

        "review_text": "Do I have to give a star? I can't believe how quickly this 'company' have undone all the good work by Virgin on the North West rail network.\n\nPaid over \u00a3100 to travel first class with my 9 year old daughter to Glasgow. Upon boarding, the first class carriage was occupied with standing, standard class passengers because the train was full. I can accept this. It shouldn't happen but sometimes situations occur. What I can't accept is drunken leering males and hungover young ladies swearing and shouting suggestive lewd comments across the carriage at 11am in the morning. 11am! And continuing to drink from cans served on the train! The reason I chose first class was to try to avoid subjecting a child to this behaviour. Sadly there were other, slightly older children on the carriage. I'm not prudish. But I do have decorum around other passengers. Especially children. \n\nThis could have - and should have - been prevented by employing sufficient staff. Perhaps employ them on a train to greater effect than serving already drunken individuals. Didn't appreciate the comments from those involved that anyone paying first class must be fools (words to that effect) given the poor state of the carriage. And that they had managed to go first class without having to pay which made the rest of us mugs (again words to that effect). Sadly they had a point.\n\nAlas I didn't see any staff in over an hour. Didn't get any food or even a beverage. My daughter - who had been looking forward to the journey - was visibly uncomfortable and upset throughout. Oh and the train was late.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've used Avanti since they took over from Virgin. The previous occasion was almost comparable. Thankfully I wasn't with a 9 year old. I put it down to teething troubles. More fool me. \n\nThe carriage was scruffy & filthy inside. Battered paintwork & generally unclean. Wouldn't have liked to envisage standard class given the state of first class. They are supposedly upgrading the carriages. Please don't charge ridiculous prices until you do. \n\nAvoid. Or at least think twice. Especially if you have children.",

Train staff then announced abruptly that there would be no hot drinks in first class today due to staffing levels. Train staff with resting betch faces then rush through asking abruptly \"Cold drink?\" (Not \"would you like a cold drink?\" etc). Decided on a glass of wine and - as I couldn't have the tea I wanted yet again - I asked if I could have a second wine in the spare glass on the table next to me. \"Not til we've served everyone else sorry\" was the reply and she then took the spare glass away!

I claimed for one 25% refund and Avanti argued and argued and argued a third time, refusing a refund because according to them the train arrived 14 minutes late even though the station clock read otherwise. They are intransigent, not customer friendly and I really wish Virgin could get the franchise back after being stitched up to lose it. I\u2019m not alone in my dislike of the new company. They need to do a Hell of a lot more to win the commuters round...and you know, I don\u2019t think they care. If there was another way to get to London from Manchester by train, I\u2019d use it.",

For the past few years Virgin were generally doing a decent enough job of running the service.\nLast week I went to book as usual and found that various useful options which used to exist were no longer available on the website. In particular the possibility of choosing individual seats. The default preferences \u2013 direction of travel, window etc were still there but the ability to specifically change the suggestions on the website and choose a particular seat from a diagram had gone.\nI called the number provided to help with bookings and was told that it wasn't possible and the call centre employee was absolutely wrongly adamant that it had never been possible, wouldn't be possible and that no train firm in England had ever offered such a feature. Since it's something I had been using myself regularly for some years I knew she was completely wrong and totally ill informed but clearly pointless discussion to pursue so I asked for the relevant customer service number.\nI called the customer service number listened to various messages pressed the options etc only to end up at a recorded message stating that \"we are not accepting phone calls at this time\" \u2013 11 AM!\nReduced functionality, hopeless booking assistance and customer services not accepting calls. A very disappointing start.",

Frustrated families with children and elderly couples who had all booked seats were left in an awful position of trying to find their seats and the inevitable confrontations with people who were in seats that were shown as available but were in fact booked.  No train staff were on hand to help and in fact we saw none for the whole journey.  Utterly appalling state of affairs altogether.

        "review_text": "Avanti have distroyed what was a reasonble Virgin West Coast service...I travel 1st class twice a week to and from Euston (and onto Heathrow) and to date I have had one train arrive on time. The food and service is terrible, I have been lucky to get 1 cup of tea in 1hr and 20mins...fresh fruit salad (which I take for breakfast)  is 99% Pineapple and Kiwi Fruit, 1 or 2 blueberries and sprinkle of pomegranate, 1 spoon of yoghurt. I dont want my yoghurt on my fruit salad I want it with the honey separate. Atleast virgin gave you a pot of yoghurt. And many of the journeys I have been faced with just a bacon roll that I have refused. The beam content hasnt changed since they took over...I am questioning why I buy a 1st class ticket, I could save the difference and buy myself someting reasonable.\nSome of the staff who serve the food are unkempt and shabby and serving OJ from cans and exected to drink from the can, no cups is unhygenic, the service is thrown at you..so I guess the staff can sit down for the rest of the journey.  For the late trains I have tried the claim/repay service, having to register ANOTHER account to do so that isnt connected to the one I use for booking and the form asks for info not useful in a claim and is long (intentionally I suspect)...train manager says train is 27mins late...repay claim says rejected as their info says 12 mins late... I could go on and on its that bad...save your money and take the west midlands trains with Avanti constant late arrivals it takes the same time :)\nStrikes me their strategy is to charge more and give less to pay for their promises, which I certainly have seen no evidence of...\nAvanti get your house in order or give the franchise to someone who knows what they are doing as you clearly dont!",

He was very helpful and told me that actually what Avanti told me was a complete lie and the Lounge is only available for LNER ticket holders and I cannot access it at all. He also told me that a number of Avanti Customers have been told the same but they didn't check like me, they got to the Lounge and were thrown out! \nIt's infuriated me that Avanti are lying through their teeth and putting customers in awkward situations in the already stressful time of travelling! \nDisgusting from them and no surprise they have such a bad rating after such a small amount of time!",

Have they snuck on even more First Class carriages, and reduced standard class? Looks like it. The train was nearly an hour late getting to London; on the way back in the evening (7pm onwards off-peak!!) it kept stopping and slowing mysteriously between stations (not signals). I'm retiring, and grateful that I won't have to make the journey down to London too much in the future. Added to that the trains seem even sadder than when they belonged to Virgin. I didn't even dare use the shop. For the first time ever I've claimed compensation - in the past I couldn't be bothered.\n\nCome back Virgin!",

Now it seems Avanti just ask this information for the sake of asking. I requested a forward facing table seat so i could work and they gave me a backward facing window seat without the table. Luckily the table nearby was unreserved so i sat there instead.\n\nThe lack of flexibility on train tickets - you either book a \u00a3184 Anytime Return or you are bound to specified trains. Virgin offered the opportunity to travel on various trains within the peak trains time window.\n\nFinally, the service from the personnel overall is extremely poor.\n\nAvanti now make my weekly work journey to London very frustrating.",

Never had a problem with Virgin, apart from the odd delay.\n\nThe drop in service levels on Avanti is astounding; in just a couple of months they've taken all the joy out of the journey. \n\nTrains are never fully staffed; those that do work are very mixed, with some making the best of it and others not bothering at all.\n\nFirst class is pointless. Never any service or food, just a standard announcement directing you to the onboard shop.\n\nVirgin had a 90% approval rating. The DfT should have thought about customers before dropping it.",

Just need to ditch the 'see it, say it, sorted' nonsense as well but I know that is national and not just Avanti. Only reason for dropping a star is inability to reserve specific seats but this can still be done by booking through another website like Trainsplit rather than direct with Avanti.",

Two carriages available for those with reservations on the 10:36. Boarded both carriages with parents and unable to even find standing room. Disgraceful treatment of customers many elderly like my travelling parents. Carriages busy than underground rush hour, people standing and sitting on the floor. Decided to cut losses  leave the train and look at alternatives, advised to board the Manchester Piccadilly service, quieter granted and able to find seats then change for the Blackpool North service of course they didn't let on that 70/80% of the Northern connecting trains were cancelled that day. There was a reason I booked the direct service so one senior railcard traveler and one disabled railcard traveler could at least travel in comfort without the worry of several changes. Overall a huge let down and disgraceful treatment of cattle (sorry customers). eventually the 70 year old's made it home albeit closer to the grave than on departure, still recovering.

        "review_text": "I have not travelled yet with Avanti but just completed a nightmare 1.5hr booking process which usually took 10 mins. \n\nNumerous issues:\n\n1) Booking process - no longer slick and easy. Website cumbersome and clunky and \u201cserver busy\u201d message kept flashing up. \n\n2) Seat selection - no longer able to choose exact seat online. With Virgin, you were able to \u201cvirtually\u201d view a diagram of the carriage and all the seats, highlight a seat and reselect as you wish. Now seat is selected automatically for you after submitting whether you prefer aisle/table/forward facing. \n\n3) Seat particulars -  on Windows PC there is no option to select \u201cnear luggage rack\u201d which is an important factor for a disabled person. So instead I downloaded the Avanti app on my iPhone where there was the \u201cnear luggage rack\u201d option, but unfortunately you could only select e ticket type using the app! This is useless if you\u2019re booking for your elderly disabled relative who needs a paper ticket!! \n\n4) Train Journey time increased - most importantly fault - I was shocked that the duration of the journey from Glasgow-Warrington has lengthened. Usually the journey took 2hrs 39 mins or 2hrs 48 mins with Virgin however now the journey can last up to 3hrs 15 minutes calling at stops that Virgin did not. \n\n5) Less Trains - as a consequence of journeys taking longer, there are less trains to choose from and this less ticket choice. \n\n6) Ridiculous ticket options - Glasgow to Warrington is a direct train so why would I step off train in Carlisle, wait on platform for 15 mins then take the next Avanti train to Glasgow! \n\n7) Ticket removed from basket - I had a return ticket in my online basket (it was last one of this type) and I was in payment details when it suddenly said it couldn\u2019t process payment as there was no ticket in the basket. When I searched again, the ticket was completely gone so obviously, even although the ticket was in my basket, it was not reserved for a period of time.",

It's such a shame Virgin contract didn't get renewed. Doubtful I'll use Avanti trains any more as it's a rip off! I'd rather get the National Express coach.",

Whereas Avanti are already proving to be incompetent. For the first time ever my recent journey was delayed for over 60 mins, and despite completing  the required forms I'm told I'm not entitled to delay repay.  I've been unable to make contact with them despite using a variety of methods. The phones are constantly engaged. The booking system wasn't working. The app. doesn't work.  The web site is shabby. For passengers to loose the services of a company like Virgin and to now have this shambles imposed on us, when there is so much already wrong with our transport system, is criminally inept.",

The carriages smelled of sewage and had clearly not been properly cleaned for weeks, not just days. The floors, windows, seats, toilets were filthy and covered in food, grease and loose dirt. My folding tray at my seat had various spilled food and drink on it. The lights above my seat failed to work. The hand drier in the toilet failed to work. On my return journey the seating information for reservations throughout the train was out-of-order which caused discomfort and confusion for all of the passengers. \n\nThis was a appalling service. At a ticket cost of \u00a3147 which was booked 4 months in advance, I expect better standards. Basic cleanliness and functioning facilities should not be for First Class passengers only.",

        "review_text": "I've been travelling on the North Wales to London Euston route for 12 years with Virgin Trains and always been perfectly happy with my experience. Avanti West Coast take over and never have I experienced anything as bad as what I expencied last week. Only a 5 car train, all the way from Holyhead (where the ferries to/from Dublin arrive), completely jam packed, no seat reservations, and barely even space to breathe. I had to stand up the entire 3 hour journey, crammed in an aisle outside a stinking toilet, no air conditioning and the heating blasting away. Possibly the worst and most unpleasant experience I have ever had on a train...anywhere in the world. From my experience I can only imagine what being on a cattle truck is like. I emailed Avanti to complain (as I can't believe I even had to pay for the 'priviledge' of being on this train) and no response whatsoever. I'm very disappointed at both Avanti's complete disregard for its customers, and the British Government for allowing them to win the bid for the West Coast mainline - bring back Virgin!",

I had an issue with my railcard, and they wanted me to pay the difference which was fair enough until they quoted me the sum of \u00a388. A one-way train journey for \u00a388.\n\nSo I refused and decided to get a cheaper journey, but due to time constraints, I decided to suck it up and go back and pay the fee, but their machine was not working. In front of me was a lady; also a student from the looks of it, who had the same issue and they let her go through with a warning. When it came to me, they were adamant about getting the ticket machine working until the last minute before the train departed. They couldn't manage so they escorted me to the train and informed the train manager to make me pay the difference.\n\nThis unfair, biased and discriminatory treatment based on gender (or race?) is unacceptable. Treat everyone the same.\n\nThere was also no onboard shop to get anything or services for anyone who doesn't hold a first-class ticket. I travelled on many trains across the country, and this is by far the most expensive and worst experience I have ever had.",

        "review_text": "Currently on the train from Liverpool to London. Apparently purchasing a ticket does not guarantee you a seat on the train! \nAlso they do not have any coffee unless of course you are a first class passenger. You can purchase a coffee but only if you upgrade to yes you\u2019ve got it ..... first class at a charge. \nWhy is it our Customer Service is still so poor in Britain.  Why not allow customers to purchase a coffee from first class if the machine is broken, or at the very least purchase a jar of instant coffee as a backup. Poor planning at its worst! \nBritain\u2019s customer service at it\u2019s best .. unfortunately!",
