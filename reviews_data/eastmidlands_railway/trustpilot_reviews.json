        "review_text": "\n\n\n\nSent from my Galaxy\nI wanted to change the train tickets for myself and my husband to an earlier time today. The Trainline App was only showing later times so went to the ticket office. I was served by a very pleasant man who issued some supplementary tickets which I paid \u00a313 for but didn't examine. When the ticket inspector came round we found that our supplementary tickets were only to Bedford. We were told we would have to get off at Bedford but had 9 minutes to try to change them at ticket office. Obviously a mix up as the original tickets were Split Save ones from London to Bedford then Bedford to Nottingham. The lady in the Bedford ticket office was very officious and unfriendly and made me feel like some criminal trying to swindle the railway. I was then told it would cost me an extra \u00a373 to get from Bedford to Nottingham so we had to wait over an hour in Bedford for our original train and out of pocket for the supplementary tickets. Good old Britain. Miserable railway staff, outdated ticketing systems and a train with plenty of free seats that we weren't able to travel on because of ridiculous beaurocracy and pricing!! Go to Amsterdam and you can buy all your rail tickets at the airport and use them on any trains!",

        "title": "Appalling Customer Service",
        "review_text": "Several things have gone wrong, to contribute to this Review, culminating in the off-hand attitude of the person I spoke to in so-called 'Customer Relations'.  Mind-you, looking at all the one-star reviews here, 'Customer Relations' must be a pretty dismal place to work.\nIn February, I tried to book a through ticket from Sheffield to Epsom, changing at St Pancras & Sutton.  This is the most convenient route with luggage, and a route I've travelled many times before.  EXCEPT - this time, I was unable to book it online.  The computer wanted to route me via Vauxhall.  So I tried at Sheffield Station ... the very helpful person in the booking office couldn't do it either.  I was forced to buy THREE separate tickets.  Inconvenient and undoubtedly more expensive.\nEMR's website is linked to the Black Hole of Communications.  I never received a reply to my query about how to book the ticket using the route I wanted, nor an acknowledgement of my Delay-Repay claim.  When I phoned 'Customer Services', they said there was no record of either my query, nor the Claim (which is now out-of-time).\nTo describe the attitude as 'off-hand' really doesn't convey the total lack of 'service'.  And apparently there is nowhere within EMR to escalate complaints.\nHence this Review.  Unfortunately, if I want a train from Sheffield to London, there is no choice.  It HAS to be EMR.\nBring back re-nationalisation!\nPS. For some reason, I can't print e-tickets either (despite having no problems previously).  If for some reason my phone doesn't work, the EMR computers aren't sophisticated enough to register that I have already paid for a ticket.  I would have to purchase another one.  Arggghhhh!!!\n\n",

The train was full on arrival in Derby with no available seats despite us having seat reservations. I got on the train but was then stuck in the entrance lobby, rammed against the door with no ability to move. I'm 68 years old with mobility issues. I endured an agonising journey to London. Many people at subsequent stations could not board the train. Our return journey was equally dreadful. At St Pancras we were corralled into a holding area by rude, unhelpful EMR staff. Our booked train was full so we couldn't board. We eventually got on a train but the whole experience has left me dreading another EMR journey. The transportation of animals is done with more care and dignity.",

Our first train to Nottingham was so crowded that we had to sit on the floor with several passengers by the toilet, which by the way was overflowing and out of order. This train was so full that the door would not shut properly, and the train was delayed. We consequently missed our connecting train at Nottingham. Our second arrived with only two carriages. It was utter chaos, again we were sat in the corridor by the toilets.  Our return journey was even more crowded from Alfreton to Nottingham and again at Nottingham we had to stand for the entire journey in the corridor.  The trains were disgustingly dirty the corridors dangerously overcrowded and the toilets filthy.  It was all in all a deeply unpleasant, exhausting set of journeys.",

Arrived 20 minutes before our train was due to leave St Pancras on which we had booked seats only to be told our train has left early as it was full. We were then moved into a holding area to wait for an hour and 45 minutes. There was no access to seats, we didn't dare leave the area as the queue behind was so long we feared we wouldn't get on the next train. This meant no access to toilets, food and drink for nearly two hours with our two children. We did make it on to the train, however it was rammed. There was confusion over whether we could sit on reserved seats and there were no members of staff to be seen on the train to deal with this. As the train was so full, access to the toilets and snack bar became impossible. I will not be travelling on this line again unless absolutely necessary. If you have mobility problems I would seriously suggest you do not travel with this company as they don't treat their passengers like human beings but more like cattle.",

Whilst there are problems on that line which have caused an increase in demand I find it profound that EMR blame this one occurrence. I have travelled for several years from Kettering to St Pancras return and this is not a new issue. EMR regularly put on trains in peak times that are inadequate for demand. The rolling stock is also out of date and untidy. They are saved by their exceptional employees who remain pleasant and professional under difficult working conditions. Whoever manages the business should actually join commuters on this line at between 6-7:38 am and on the evening return to experience both the disappointment when you see a train arriving with 9 carriages, knowing that you will be standing for the whole journey (usually by the one/maybe two toilets that actually work) and then the cramped conditions on the train once you board, then the behaviour of travellers who in frustration make comments to your staff. EMR are unfit to run a franchise and should have it taken away from them. Just for being incompetent and forcing their employees to endure what must be awful working conditions.",

        "review_text": "Not surprised to see their rating overall is 1.4. Awful experience today at both Kettering and with their Indian customer services call centre. An error when booking led to us needing to cancel our ticket at the station to re-book. The error only became apparent when the ticket had been scanned. They then would not give us a refund because the ticket had been scanned despite it being a ticket to travel on a train when we had not even boarded a train and were instead still at the entrance to the station. Total inflexibility and lack of concern for us from all concerned at EMR. In the end i was sold an anytime return,  this was \u00a338 more expensive than the ticket i had already purchased online. Total rip off! The train was also freezing cold. No heating on despite it being 1oC outside. Obviously saving money for the fat cat shareholders.",

Second the escalators in St Pancras weren't working (not EMR's fault, but people were struggling with huge bags). Thirdly the staff were just herding people into queues - lots of people went into the wrong queue. The Sheffield queue ended up literally right around the station. Fourthly when I got to the front I was just shouted at to 'GET ON, JUST GET ON!' I had a reserved First Class ticket but no way could I get to it inside the train as it was rammed and I had luggage too. Fifthly there was no attempt at trying to help people with onward connections (like some train companies do). Sixthly I had to stand all the way to Sheffield, missed my connection like loads of other people and EMR were nowhere to help. Loads of people then got the next train North and so ... had to stand again. Seventhly this dire service apparently allows for 25% refund because it was only 27 minutes late - no refund for having to stand or missing connections or just being treated like cattle. Eighthly the EMR Website is a nightmare of poor programming (including a drop down that appears everytime a new page is displayed, and every time has to be clicked passed). and Ninethly even their 'contact us' form is poor as you have to give a wholly unrelated reason for you complaint to get a complaint email sent.",

No problem, the 1705 Nottingham service must've had a Special Stop Order for Wellingborough and it was the first stop. Apart from a short speed restriction, the journey was quick (under 50 minutes) uneventful.\nI do tip my hat though to the onboard team. Smiling and happy, very polite and spent a lot of time throughout the train. I thought it was a very pleasurable journey that I'd be happy to recommend to others. \nThe odd thing is that I live 5 minutes away from Northampton Station but whenever I need to go to London, I'd rather drive to Wellingborough and get the EMR service.",

But chaos with pushing and shoving and as I am disabled there were no seats and no staff to help due to staff not daring to pass the queuing passengers who were expecting to get to Sheffield. 3 trains worth of passengers pushed onto this train. The time for arrival got changed so many times and then we were all made to get off at Chesterfield train station. Chaos as there were too many people to get on and we got back 18.40 nearly 3 hours later.as one train was over an hour later and others cancelled so we were stranded. Appalling and not sure if I will renew my rail card. All the guy kept saying was claim compensation!",

Not only is it extortionate (nearly \u00a311k per annum between Leicester and London) it\u2019s also the worst service you could imagine. First class is a dump - the coffee tastes as awful as it looks. Most of the staff have a serious attitude problem and the useless guys at the barriers at Leicester spend most of their time with their hands in their pocket chatting to one another with not a care in the world about customers. Quite how it takes 5 of these folk to man a couple of barriers is beyond me. \n\nBiggest problem has to be lack of communication; it\u2019s like they\u2019re allergic to sharing info and you\u2019re just stood there waiting and guessing. Refunds are a nightmare to get too. But apologies are handed out free - they\u2019re good at that. BTW if it\u2019s internet you\u2019re looking for, look no further than your mobile phone because the on-board Wi-Fi sure as hell doesn\u2019t work most of the time. \n\nSave your money. Walk.",

On the way back, we wanted to get a slightly earlier train back (also a super off peak train with no different in price). We spoke to the ticket office in Manchester station who told us that would be no problem as the train still had free seats that we wanted to get on. The ticket inspector came round and we explained we had paid full price for tickets and what we had been told at the station. The ticket officer said we needed to buy completely new tickets or we\u2019d be met by the revenues collector (offering us a \u00a3100 fine, to pay full price ticket again and a police caution). I find this completely unfair as we\u2019d of never got on this train had we known we were expected to get completely new tickets. I offered to get off at the next stop and wait for my later train- he said i\u2019d be met by revenue collectors. In the end, I ended up having to buy 2 new tickets. I asked if I could buy the ticket online as the price was so much cheaper. Instead, he charged his price which was much higher. I felt there was no consideration for us on this occasion. We were told false information and then punished for their issue harshly. Very expensive train trip, met with customer service which felt unfair.",

Our train was cancelled the next train was only 4 coaches long and was so over crowded even the aisles were full of people standing, so we got back off. The next train was delayed by 45 minutes which we boarded and found seats but obviously not the seats we booked. First class was declassified so was full with everyone sitting anywhere and no hosting service. we eventually arrived in London but very late. On the return trip from St Pancras we booked two first class seats in coach D, when we arrived at the train Coach D was standard class so we moved to Coach G which was first class but had to move because our seat numbers were booked by someone else. We did find other seats in first class but the toilet at one end of our coach were out of order and the electric door at the other end was faulty and wouldn't open so we couldn't access any toilets. About 10 minutes from the end of our journey a member of staff arrived and managed to open the door using the floor button. Overall an appalling service, before I booked the tickets I considered driving and next time I will. The only positive point was all the train staff we came into contact with at Market Harborough, St Pancras and onboard were wonderful.",

I asked a st Pancreas and they said \"yeah, just jump on the next\" I did this until just outside Derby when a ticket collector accused me of lying. She was very confrontational, and could not believe their ticket office would make mistake. I don't even record off the radio that how honest I am. She then said \"she'd let me off this time\" like she was doing me a favour. Awful service for the price. It was the 19.51 from Long Eaton. Fly, it's worse for the environment, but cheaper and you don't have to deal with ticket people who can't blend their foundation into their neck!!!!!",

Then I get a threatening email from their \"fraud\" department demoing treble the payment or be prosecuted.

It doesn't tell you when to board. In the end the guy on the platform gives up and calls you down to the train. There's only 4 minutes left so if you are physically disabled forget it. 3. Get on the train and find your reserved seat. When you find it sitting in a wheelie bin would be cleaner and more comfortable. The sign says it's not reserved too. 4. The chap in front if me has got on the wrong train and the  guard tells him to get off next stop. I point out the board announcements were not live. The guard says you have to listen for announcements. I'm glad I'm not deaf.  5.Clearly for business this seems useless. As someone who is autistic my day is already wrecked. Next time ill take the car or bus and never mind emissions. If this gets any worse I'll travel night before and stay over. At least I'll get to work with  a productive mind.",

Seriously why do you need a carpet on public transport!!??? \nThen I couldn\u2019t find any luggage space as there are only two on each coach and were filled with small hand luggages that wouldn\u2019t fit on the shelf above the seats as the space allocated was too narrow and it could only fit small backpacks.. \nThen I noticed how badly and filthy and the disrepair that the sits are!! I wanted to throw up as the red backrests from red fabric turned into black from dirt and it was all worn out. The seats were all stained and horribly filthy and as soon as I sat I felt the seat cushion gone with my bum sinking in and I could feel the metal bars poking on my thighs!! \nand then you have the refreshments trolley guy screaming every 10mins to move our luggages from the corridor as he\u2019s passing through with his trolley.. \nSeriously this filth in there doesn\u2019t worth a penny and it\u2019s against health and safety! \nDisgusting!!\nPity we can't post pictures in here!",

        "review_text": "I am extremely upset with the EMR.\nMy journey back to Sheffield was cancelled Sunday 18th February 2024, and there were no more journeys to Sheffield that evening to travel back. Therefore, leaving me to stay in Norwich overnight. I had purchased insurance on this journey and so I called trainline that evening and was redirected about 5 times to different departments, all of which did not help or were not open. I then had to book a trip the following day to Sheffield which was more expensive due to it being the following day. All departments and EMR would only offer a refund on the one journey that was cancelled. No help with funds on the more expensive ticket to Sheffield the following day or compensation. I have now spent a ridiculous amount on this journey.\nWhen I then called EMR today to ask for some kind of fund or compensation for their mess up of my journey, they refused. They told me I should have called that Sunday evening. Trainline did not tell me to call EMR that Sunday evening when I asked how to get compensation, so how would I have known to contact them? The trainline and EMR HR is so infuriating. I spent 2-3 hours both Sunday evening and today on the phone either on hold or cut off the line. I have never been so stressed over public transport.\nIf I am not offered compensation for this, as it says on my insurance policy, I will very upset. I have spent an immense amount of money on travelling cross country to get back to Sheffield because of this companies mess up, not mine. And to then be refused funds and passed through every department because no one knows what to do is so time wasting and stressful. \nI will not pay this much money for someone else's mess, and for my week to be affected (not being able to attend work on Monday).",

I have never been humiliated this way before. My tickets was not working and I showed it to them. Then it was a white guy and a white blonde lady with curly hair. They asked me to wait with a horrible attitude, I did as I didn\u2019t know the time were specific. On my ticket it say 21:15 and I was waiting patiently since 20:00. Then when they announced for us to board the 21:15 train, my ticket refused to work, I kept calling these people for help and they kept ignoring me and looking away, giving me this look like am not a human being while attending to others. At a point I started thinking if it could be my colour because I don\u2019t understand. Then one of them an Asian man came and told me to keep waiting with a horrible tone and attitude, without wanting to hear me out. I had to literally scream repeatedly while showing him my ticket before he told me to go on that he didn\u2019t realise my train was 21:15. No apologies nothing. I had to run with my whole strength to catch up with my train that was about leaving, after staying In cold for ages. My heart is shattered because I have never experienced this humiliation before. These bunch of devils need proper training ASAP or should not allowed to work with people. They lack all the qualities that make someone a human. No empathy, nothing. How can people be so wicked!!! You all can do better!!!!!",

However I was supposed to get on the front of the train and ended up going to the back of the train - I blame Bruno Mars - that\u2019s who I was listening to ;)\nAnyways when the ticket officer came I had explained I got on the wrong train. From previous experience this is the part where the ticket officers gets angry - charges me extra for my mistake and ruins my day. But on this day Thursday 14th Decemberi received an early Christmas present. The ticket officer \u201cR. Philips EMR 2435\u201d he was sympathetic and gave me an extra ticket telling me to get off at Chesterfield to go back to my original destination Derby. I was surprised and grateful that we has understanding and we even laughed at the situation. It\u2019s people like that that make my day man. Thank you R.

This would have made me late for work and causing a great deal of trouble.\nThe other two times, the train conductor obviously can't read a timetable as it departed at 07:12. Why the hell is it called the 07:13 when it departs at 07:12?! The same goes for the Kettering departure - why call it the 07:22 when, at 07:22, it's nowhere to be found because it's already buggered off into the distance, having left at 07:21?!\nThis company is unfit for purpose. Timekeeping is bad, the Intercity trains are in bad condition, the Connect trains are 20 year old units that are in dire need of refurbishment, and the whole lot of them are filthy inside and out. The Connect services don't have any facilities and the Wi-Fi doesn't work on the Intercity services. Avoid and drive if possible!",

The trains were massively oversold due to engineering works on the east coast mainline however, EMR continued to make sales and \u2018reserve\u2019 seats you had no hope of ever sitting in for a 3hr journey. We had no choice but to travel on this weekend and expected busy trains & some possible delays but the scale of the chaos was unbelievable. \n\nIt started at St Pancras where on arrival (nearly an hour early for the train as advised) we were greeted by queues of people being herded into the upper concourse and yelled at by staff wearing EMR jackets to join one of three queues. Anyone who enquired about timings, journey options or indeed anything was barked at that \u2018we haven\u2019t got any information and we don\u2019t know\u2019. \n\n2hrs later in a queue with a young child, and unable to leave it due to no one to hold our place and not being sure if we\u2019d miss the next train, we were shoe horned onto a Sheffield train where we stood for the whole journey, being pushed and stood on by other passengers and there was a single working toilet on the train. Bearing in mind that the company knew the works were happening but decided this was the weekend to make all trains short formed. They also continued to tell customers all their stock was out, when in fact they run longer trains mid week, and there were a whole lot of idle carriages waiting in sidings at one station. Shortly before boarding a well meaning staff member then started to announce that if you want to go to Doncaster catch the Nottingham train and get a rail replacement to Peterborough it\u2019ll be quicker. And it would have been but they failed to say this 2hrs earlier.\n\n We then submitted a compensation claim to which EMR declined the claim and said the delay had been caused by our connecting trains so they would \u2018pass it on\u2019. Then it was declined because of course the delay was totally EMR\u2019s inability to board passengers in a logical manner such as having standby queues for those without reservations instead of a big free for all. A further email to their complaints department hasn\u2019t even been acknowledged. \n\nGreedy, uncaring company I will literally never use them again I\u2019d rather walk! ",

We decided to upgrade to first class as the previous week's journey was herendous (had to stand part of the journey to Sheffield) on arrival we were informed there was no first class and all reserved seats were now unreserved!! So basically it was a \"free for all\" on a five carriage train!!! Some of us managed to get a seat but my daughter and her partner had to sit on the floor as did many other passengers. No onboard service provided and A/C not working (did not see one EMR employee on the train) all information on the train was delivered by Norman Collier on the tannoy system!!!. The journey from London to chesterfield took four hours where we were informed that the train had broken down and we would have to get off and wait for the next train to Sheffield BUT there might not be enough space on the first train so we might have to wait for the next!!!! At this point having lost the will to live we got a taxi from chesterfield. And they say privatisation is good!!! The rail companies are very good at taking your money but trying to get a refund/compensation is designed to explode your brain!!! BRING BACK NATIONALISATION!!!!!",

        "review_text": "I travel with EMR a lot and have been for over 10 years. Seat reservations work about 30% of the time, which always causes frustration and arguments when people try and work out where to sit. They always put on too many first class carriages, which are left virtually empty with not enough seats for people in second class. They always lie about why they are late - for example on a Sunday service which is already billed to be 2hours 35minutes instead of 1hour 29minutes and then is delayed by 20 minutes supposedly due to speed restrictions. The reason why the journey is already an hour longer is the speed restrictions, the extra delay is clearly something else so why lie and say it's speed restrictions? We're not unintelligent so why treat us like it? Carriages are always dirty, particularly toilets, I've been on trains with dried sick up the internal carriage doors. They treat people at St. Pancras like cattle when waiting to get on trains, they don't let crowds through the barriers, often until just 8-5 minutes before trains depart, creating stressful and dangerous situations. Catering services are regularly cancelled or unable to get through the train due to overcrowding - heaven forbid you might need some drinking water. All this for often over \u00a3100 for and hour and a half journey, so over a pound a minute of absolutely no service at all. I wonder what the execs have been spending the thousands of pounds I've spent on the company over the years on... Because it certainly hasn't been any kind of reinvestment. I imagine it is on absolutely any other form of travel other than an EMR train.",

We arrived on time only for all the gates to be red crosses and staff telling us that there was an amended service and the 22:47 train was no longer running. We were advised that the other options were to wait until 23:35 or go downstairs to catch another train to Bedford and pay for a taxi to Wellingborough.\nThe tickets were bought in advance through Trainline and we were never told of this change by EMR or Trainline. The boards at the station were still showing cancelled trains were running as was the EMR app and Trainline. Your staff were fully aware of these errors and apologised as much as possible but they can vouch for this. There were hundreds of others in the same situation at the station.\nWe decided to catch the 23:35. This service was also delayed en route. It was the slowest train I\u2019ve ever been on. When we were parallel with the motorway we had HGV lorries overtaking us. We also came to a standstill for quite a long time. The announcer said this was due to engineering work. The staff also apologised for the refreshments not being available too due to staff shortages. Quite frankly it was a shambles. Me and my son had travelled from abroad and we had no food or drink. We finally ended up in Wellingborough at Approx 1:15am. Our original time of arrival to Wellingborough should\u2019ve been 23:51. That\u2019s 1 hour and 25 minutes late. EMR\u2019s response is that it was an amended service so no refunds can be given. Absolute disgrace",

        "review_text": "Vastly overpriced for the service you get. Compared to west midlands trains, east midlands are always way more expensive, even when you book in advance. But you're paying more for a significantly worst experience.\n\nI will say that in my experience their trains are generally on schedule but the seat reservations don't operate more often than not, especially on Sundays. This leads to a lot of unnecessary stress and people being rude to each other that could all easily be avoided. \n\nAlso if you travel in first class, you no longer get the free trolley service on a Sunday, which is a bit rich considering it still costs the same as the other 6 days of the week. The WiFi is appalling and half the time has no internet connection, the rest of the time it's so slow that it's unusable. There are plug sockets in first class but for some bizarre reason they are often disabled and don't work.\n\nThe staff are generally very friendly, I can't say a bad word about them, but overall the EMR service is in desperate need of an overhaul to bring the standard up and the prices down. I now drive over to Rugby or Nuneaton and use the west mids trains down to London instead. It works out a lot cheaper, takes the same amount of time, the stations and trains are less busy, seat reservations work and overall it is a much more pleasant experience.",

        "title": "EMR: Beware of Excessive Penalties and Unprofessional Conduct",
        "review_text": "Very disappointing experience I had with EMR. Here are the details. I strongly advise against using EMR due to an extremely unpleasant incident during my journey on 08 Aug 2023. I encountered an unwarranted penalty and ticket charge.\n\nMy initial ticket cost was \u00a335, including the railcard discount, but unfortunately, it was deemed invalid by an arrogant revenue collector officer who handled the situation in an unprofessional and rude manner.\n\nUpon realizing my railcard was indeed invalid, I agreed to pay the discounted rate of \u00a315 for the journey. However, the officer aggressively insisted on a fine, displaying a complete disregard for my situation.\n\nTo my astonishment, he imposed a hefty fine of \u00a3100 for the ticket, in addition to a \u00a350 penalty. This exorbitant fine was entirely disproportionate to my regular travel expenses, which usually range between \u00a345-\u00a355. It was clear that the ticket checker's actions were fueled by a desire for retaliation following our disagreement.\n\nAcknowledging my fault regarding the railcard, I promptly paid the excessive fine of \u00a3153.0 to avoid further complications. In total, I have already paid \u00a335 (initial ticket) + \u00a3153.0 (fine) = \u00a3188. I requested a refund of the excess amount, but after chasing them for 3 months, they simply said, 'Sorry, we can't do anything.' Beware of such unfair treatment when dealing with EMR.",

        "review_text": "I travelled on 27 December 2023 (strike day) but I had booked my train in advance and the specific train I had booked (11.32 from London St Pancras to Sheffield) was included on the new strike timetable, so I planned to travel as intended. \nHowever, when I arrived at St Pancras, my train had completely disappeared from the departures timetable - it didn\u2019t show as \u2018cancelled\u2019, it had disappeared completely from the timetable. \nI got no warning or explanation about this from EMR, so could not plan accordingly. I then had to queue with hundreds of others by the tickets barriers, only to miss the next train at 12.02 due to overcrowding and then only just squeeze onto the 12.32 after a huge and scary crush through the single ticket barrier that the EMR staff opened. \nWhen I applied for a refund for my 11.32 train for which I had booked an advance ticket, I was promptly and definitively told that because my train had been removed from the timetable (even though I received no warning or notice about this) that I was ineligible for any compensation whatsoever as compensation is only for delayed or trains cancelled on the day. However, my journey was delayed by over an hour due to not getting on the 12.02 train after my intended train, but I have no way of proving that I could not get on this train as my ticket was for the earlier train. \nI later discover that EMR had done what\u2019s called a \u2018P Code\u2019 where they change the timetable at short notice the day before a strike day without notifying passengers in order to minimise the amount of compensation they are obliged to pay according to their policies. \nThis is evidently what happened to my 11.32 train. I feel undervalued as a passenger, denied compensation which is totally owed to me. \nI also feel sorry for the staff who were working at St Pancras the day I was travelling, because they were obviously doing the best they could, but their management and the management of EMR in general is in total disarray and is cheating passengers out of their own money. \nOn my advice - avoid EMR at all costs. Unreliable, shocking customer service, simply a large company only concerned with achieving its goals at the expense of the common person.",

        "review_text": "The frontline staff on EMR are lovely - friendlier and funnier than the average UK operator.  I used to really like using their trains.  For any of you reading this - I'm genuinely saddened to be writing what follows.  EMR's management are to blame, not you. \n\nEMR canceled all its Nottingham trains one rainy January night due to a signalling fault and announced there would be no more service until the next day.  In this instance a train company is obligated by something called the National Rail Conditions of Travel (google them, Trustpilot doesn't allow links) to provide alternative transport, or if that's not possible a hotel, at its own expense.\n\n 28.2 \"Where disruption prevents you from completing the journey ... any Train Company will, where it reasonably can, provide you with alternative means of travel to your destination, or if necessary, provide overnight accommodation\"\n\nEMR evidently didn't have a workable contingency plan in place so the result was chaos.  Hundreds (thousands?) of marooned passengers, nobody taking charge, staff on the platforms saying they had no idea what would happen but instructing us to pay for taxis out of our own pockets then claim the money back later.\n\n\"But I shouldn't have to pay for a taxi\" I kept telling them, \"EMR has to\".  \"There's a shortage of buses and taxis\" they said, \"EMR can't get them\".  I pointed out the obvious flaw in this logic, that if EMR can't find a taxi the passenger is unlikely to either, but it was brushed aside.  \"You could wait to see if we fix the service\" they said.  \"But your website says it's suspended for the rest of the day\".  \"Yes but it might get better\" they replied.  \n\nThat's not what \"suspended for the rest of the day\" means.\n\nAfter an hour and a half waiting to see if EMR would reinstate the service, and being told several times it wouldn't pay for a taxi, and faced with a website saying there was no viable way to reach my destination, I had to bite the bullet, fuming, and book a \u00a3128 Uber journey (I pity the guy I met headed for London!).  It arrived almost immediately.  \"Quiet night mate\" said the driver, \"there's loads of us free\".  \n\nSo much for EMR's \"shortage of taxis in Nottingham\".\n\nI got home an hour and a half late.  The next morning, p***ed off, I emailed EMR the receipt as instructed.  \"We aim to answer all queries in 5-20 working days\" said the automated response.  \n\nWhat. The. Actual.  EMR's customer service team is so understaffed that it might take a month to respond and give me back my \u00a3128?  That I had to spend on top of the ticket I'd already paid it for!\n\nSo far so infuriating, but EMR's behaviour afterwards has been downright shocking.  7 days on, with regular reminders on social media and promises from its staff to chase, it still hasn't repaid my \u00a3128.  \n\nIf my company turned out to have no workable contingency plan for a foreseeable event, and suddenly had to tell its customers to pay hundreds to provide the product for it, I'd be mortified.  I would be grovelling, tearing out my hair and begging forgiveness and I would darn well mean it.\n\nNo such shame from EMR's managers.  Despite vague promises of an investigation the attitude seems to be \"business as usual\" and \"sod off, we'll give you a refund when we feel like it\". \n\nYesterday, six days later, EMR finally squeezed out a halfhearted response to my complaint.  It flannelled about \"having a care\" for its passengers and conspicuously avoided discussion of any legal obligations.  It failed to explain why EMR lacks adequate contingency plans.  It said it was sorry for my \"frustration\" but not for most of the things it actually did.\n\nWorst of all it tried to gaslight me that returning my \u00a3128, which I should never have had to pay, is somehow \"compensation\".  Apart from the (mandatory) delay repay nothing else was offered.\n\nThat's right folks, if EMR asks you to pay \u00a3128 to provide its service for it, and it later deigns to return your money, that's compensation.\n\nNice.",

        "review_text": "Here's the letter that I wrote to Mr Will Rogers EMR's CEO and Mr Jody Ford Trainline's CEO.  I also wrote to LNER's CEO and he was very prompt and helpful in his response. \n\nAs a frequent rail traveller, I feel that I have a fair understanding of the fare rules and problems that one might encounter when travelling by train.  Some problems that arise on trains are certainly matters of safety and maintenance and are therefore out of the hands of the rail line.  However, this past Saturday, 12 November 2022, I decided to use my one-month open return Chesterfield to London St Pancras.  I arrived at London St Pancras from Gatwick airport to board the 13:19 London St Pancras to Chesterfield for the return part of my journey.  As usual, I used Trainline to book and select my tickets.  I also used this app to select my return journey.  As I discovered, as evidenced on the attachment, all EMR trains that day were being advised to either walk or take a tube to either Euston or Kings Cross to use an alternative train to Chesterfield, as there were no trains leaving from London St Pancras to Chesterfield.  \n\nFollowing this published advised and checking EMR\u2019s live travel updates (also attached).  I proceeded, as instructed, to join the LNER Harrogate train that would require a change a Grantham in order to arrive at Chesterfield.  The following occurred:\n\n\u2022\tAfter starting the journey on the LNER train (as instructed by Trainline), I was informed that there was no agreement between EMR and LNER for the transfer of passengers.  I would have to pay the ticket fare in full again.\n\u2022\tI was repeatedly harassed by the LNER ticket master to pay for the ticket.  This caused me and other affected passengers a great deal of public humiliation and stress. \n\u2022\tThe LNER ticket master also tried to issue me with a \u2018non-payment of fare\u2019 ticket and told me I would have to take this up with EMR.  I refused to do this. It was not my fault that Trainline had published false information and that EMR had not established an agreement for the transfer of passengers to LNER. \n\u2022\tI called Trainline to discuss a possible solution / recourse.  I was on the phone for 60 minutes.  I spoke to 6 customer representatives.  My called was transferred to a supervisor once, at which point I was cut off as no-one was available.  Throughout the course of the journey my phone signal was weak and cut off, which meant I had to phone back and each time I had to speak to a new representative.  This was very frustrating.  Only one representative attempted to call me back.  \n\u2022\tEach representative was unaware of the EMR situation from London St Pancras.  Each one told me that I had an EMR ticket and that had to be used on an EMR train only.  This I understand.  However, when the instruction for every train that day stipulates a walk or tube to an alternative service, as a customer, I expect that advise to be correct and not misleading.  I also expect EMR to have a prior agreement with LNER to accept passengers following this advice. \n\u2022\tThis continued stance from Trainline staff was very frustrating.  Even after the LNER ticket master took my phone, explained to them that they had published false information and that LNER would not accept any more passengers following this erroneous advice, they did not comprehend, apologise or offer a solution.  The LNER ticket master asked them to refund my ticket of \u00a3150.00 (First Class) so I could pay the LNER price. They refused and told me to send evidence of the issue and their complaints team would get back to me in due course.  Not very helpful in the moment.\n\u2022\tFinally, the LNER ticket master realised that he nor I was getting very far and were not going to receive any help from Trainline staff.  At this point I had arrived at Grantham, and he let me leave to catch the connecting EMR train.\n\u2022\tArriving at Grantham I was told it was a two carriage cross-country train to Chesterfield.  \n\u2022\tI called Trainline again.  I stated that I had paid \u00a3150.00 for a First Class ticket and now as in a Standard Class carriage for half the duration of my total journey.  \n\u2022\tWe discussed, yet again, the rules of EMR tickets and I needed to prove my position re the false advice published on the Trainline app.  There was no attempt to look at the timetable and see that every train that day was affected in this way and no information was given to passengers that EMR tickets would not be valid on these alternative routes!\n\nAll in all, this was an appalling journey and brand experience.  As leaders of these companies, you should be ashamed of treating passengers in this manner. I would appreciate an explanation of the events for this day and redress, if not a full refund, for the distress encountered, and the lack of first class travel I paid for.",

The Northern train was cancelled and she understandably presumed she could catch the next train to the same destination which was another EMR train. The uncaring jobsworth conductor inspected her ticket and ejected her at the next station telling her wait for the next Northern train. She sat there alone on an a cold empty platform for an hour at night petrified that an attacker might appear. If further trains were cancelled she could well have been stranded there.

        "review_text": "East Midlands Railway is generally unreliable; my train in the morning is freqently delayed, and quite often in the evening leg of my journey there are no seats at all, leading to cramped conditions. However, I was not prepared for how bad the experience of travelling from Nottingham to Birmingham would be on a Saturday. Journeying with my partner, two young children, two elderly in-laws for a relative's birthday party, it seemed the quickest, most painless way to get us there. I had not reckoned on the sheer volume of football supporter passengers who were already drinking (and drunk) at 9.30am and who acted in an entitled, obnoxious and foul-mouthed manner all the way (including one group refusing to move so a woman could alight; she ended up having to get off at the next station, understandably furious and having had her day ruined)!\n\nGiven the huge amount of football supporters plus all the other passengers, some/most of whom had presumably purchased tickets in advance, the decision to cram everyone into only two coaches made for an uncomfortable, unpleasant and possibly dangerous journey - and quite obscene considering the inflated cost of the train tickets!\n\nI hoped, as we travelling back later in the evening a good while after the football had finished, we might have a more pleasant ride home. But, no. Two coaches again, standing room only, people squashed together, smelling each other's BO, impossible to move or think or relax. Again, it is a disgrace what is charged for tickets and the absolute state of the service and the experience. We arrived home that night feeling stressed out and exhausted.\n\nFor anyone thinking I'm an idiot for travelling on a Saturday because...football...I reserve a portion of my disgust for the football supporters. I don't give a fig about the stupid sport and seeing these unreconstructed apes (including underage drinkers and older men who should know better) acting like they owned the train and being generally revolting filled me with a sort of existential despair that I don't expect from a ride on a choo-choo train. I kind of thought the game was a bit more civilised these days. I was wrong. Bunch of animals.\n\nEMR...pull your socks up. Your service is consistently terrible.",

Poor communication of rules between office/platform staff and onboard staff, to make you pay for additional tickets onboard which feels like a scam.

        "title": "Sloppy service and ripped off",
        "review_text": "Since July, the use of EMR services has become regular for me due to work and leisure purposes but this is in contrast to their irregular services. Trains are often delayed, cancelled or way behind schedule to and from my departure and arrival stations. Recently, I had a delayed train and followed the procedure for the Delay Repay scheme to get a refund and was only awarded a refund of 12.5% of my return ticket price for a 15+ minute delay.\n\nConsidering my train was delayed to depart by 30 minutes, I find it disgusting to only have been given a refund for a delay of between 15 and 29 minutes. The departure time was scheduled for 18:15 and the train didn't actually depart until 18:45, now I'm not a master in mathematics but even I know that is a 30 minutes delay, so to avoid myself getting annoyed trying to appeal, I just accepted this deceit and accepted my \u00a32.93 refund. \n\nAlso, this may not be down to EMR but worth a mention on how stations are changing platforms now and again which is awkward when you need to transfer from one train to another with only like 5 mins transfer time which is also often conflicted due to late arrivals.\n\nOverall, the service is 'ok' but from a very unsatisfied customer.\n\nUpdate: this company has the audacity to strike yet the services they are providing are very poor. Cancellations, delays, some very arrogant train conductors and staff. Are they surprised people refuse to use their services?\n\nUpdate (16/10/22):\nAfter they close down a major connection between Nottingham and Grantham for engineering works, it was good that rail replacement was arranged. However, when rail replacement arrive 6 minutes past its scheduled arrival time leaving a 4 minute transfer from Grantham entrance to Platform 3, I miss my connecting train by approximately only 30 seconds. Do these (EMR & rail replacement company) actually communicate at all? If they knew a bus was going to be slightly late then why not hold the train back by 5 mins maximum at least? Half the times their services are never on time so what difference would 5 mins have made?\n\nI'll continue to update this review each time I use EMR trains just so the public can actually see how unacceptable this company is and its rail replacement companies too. Cannot keep treating passengers to this shoddy show of a service, something needs doing and don't get me started on them striking!",

No reply to my complaint. Still no refund in my bank after being told they would pay half my ticket prices back x 2 \ud83d\ude02 I will be ringing again....and again...and again until I get my money. Hello? Is there anyone there? And they look at you gone out when you ask them questions. It's hilarious.",

        "review_text": "Dreadful service. Twice in the last month I have had the misfortune to use their services, once from King's Coss to Hoveton, the second time from Edinburgh to Hoveton. Both journeys had several legs to them and the only leg which encountered a delay was on both the EMR legs, both signal failures and both in old rolling stock in 30 degree heat. The conductors on both occasions said we were entitled to a full refund as the delays were between half hour and 2 hours. EMR first blamed the other train companies on the other legs and forwarded my claim to them. Then when that didn't work they denied that there were delays even tho on one of the journeys 7 other trains were caught up in the delay. I would give zero stars if possible as this is the worst service I've received in 40 years of traveling. I dread having to use their services again.",

        "review_text": "A fateful morning on August 17th from Sheffield to London. I completely understand that the 2 to 3 hour delays were out of their control. What was in their control was communication, not for the first time have I been sat on a stuck EMR train without any clue what is happening.\nTo add insult to injury my delay repay claim was rejected. I can understand why, their shareholders come first, and if customers give up then it's win win. Having checked the Rail Ombudsman web site it appears I have to wait 40 days before I can raise a complaint. I have stuck a reminder in the diary and held onto my tickets.\nEven if you have purchased your tickets through the EMR web site they will still ask for details and copies of your tickets. When I was delayed on LNER, they messaged me immediately after the delay and simply confirmed where I wanted the refund sent to, ever so painless. EMR seem to have designed their process around avoiding payouts.\nAs far as travel it's a reasonable service although a virtual monopoly for Sheffield to London unless you wish to take the slow train to Doncaster and change there. It's in need of modernisation but the seats are relatively comfortable. For years I travelled first class but the deals are few and far between and it really isn't value for money. A token food offering and marginally more spacious seats, really not worth the money. If two of us are travelling then we now drive and park outside the congestion zone, it's cheaper and more flexible.",

        "review_text": "Firstly, who at EMR is responsible for reading reviews and answering some common questions? Either, like their service, they are not bothered or have no customer service, which fair enough is self evident, as if you want to get hold off someone then make sure you\u2019re ready to speak to someone in India trying to relay current information and give advice that to be honest is lost in translation and frustration. Called to complain about cancelled trains and all I got was, but Sir you can take the next one! REALLY! Well I never. I said what if the next train is cancelled, oh but no Sir it\u2019s not cancelled! Can you guarantee that? Oh yes Sir.\n One hour later. Train cancelled, called and I can take the next train! So the moral is, when you call to complain you are told politely that you can take the next train! And by all accounts trying to get a refund is as difficult as everyone says here. Anyway, try speaking to one of the two girls in customer service at Nottingham train station in-between their tea and chat! No chance. Same arrogance on line with principles of EMR. So how do they get away with it?! Because they can.  Because we don\u2019t het listened too and we need to get to work to pay the bills.",

They have turned a blind eye to their own legislation-The Railways Regulations 2018 or any of the evidence I have provided which i deem more than sufficient. The railway minister herself said that I should \"feel confident that the appeals system will recognise an honest mistake and treat you fairly\". This, unfortunately, could not be any further from the truth. You only have to look at the poor trust pilot rating for this company. They basically have a monopoly on the market so they do not care- they don't even respond to customers reviews!!! I use this service regularly to see family members but will most certainly be looking at alternative routes. Let's see how my third appeal with the independent panel goes....",

We got to Nottingham on 2nd July 2022 to be told our train wasn\u2019t on so we had to get a train to Luton, wait for a bus service to Hitchin and then get back on the train to st Pancras London. This added over an hour onto our journey. No details of any delay/service problems on my app/ tickets\u2026coming home was even worse. We arrived at st Pancras to return to Nottingham 3rd July, we were sent to a platform that was closed to be told we had to go to kings cross station and get on a LNER train to Grantham and not to speak to anyone, just get on the train\u2026again no details of anything on my app/ticket/journey..we tried to get on this train but every seat was reserved. We got off the train after being confronted by some passengers & I asked for help. I told the LNER worker was the EMR guy at st Pancras had said..shown him my ticket and he radio\u2019d for assistance. I was in a panic because I genuinely thought we were stranded there. We\u2019d been sat in the station for hours, on the floor, it was so busy and we didn\u2019t know what to do. The guy from LNER was extremely helpful - he let us get on that train in first class\u2026we arrived at Grantham and had to wait approximately 45 minutes for a train to Nottingham and then we arrived at Nottingham and had to wait an hour for a train to Mansfield. The whole getting to London and getting back was a nightmare. Not once has my tickets changed or have I been informed of any of this. It was a nightmare! I paid over \u00a3100 for our tickets and the delay/refund drop down is rubbish and they don\u2019t do any sort of complaints and delays/cancellations over the phone - what a shock!! I want my money back and quite frankly I\u2019d like an apology for absolutely rubbish service!!!!",

I can't use the website to make the claim because it doesn't recognise my journey details.\n2. I spent over an hour queuing on the phone. At first, I was told I'd have to go back to the point of purchase, despite the point of purchase being EMR's website. Then, the agent spent ages taking some details and told me they'd get back to me the next day - I still haven't heard anything a fortnight later.\n3. I e-mailed EMR on 8th June and received an e-mail advising I need to register the claim online, even though I'd explained in the e-mail that I had already tried - clearly \"Rose\" didn't read my e-mail properly and just sent a stock e-mail.\n4. Every time I try calling, I'm kept on hold for a ridiculous amount of time. It takes 5-10 minutes for the queue to go down by 1 person, which tells me there's only ever 1 person manning the phones.\n\nThe trains are always dirty and strewn with rubbish, regardless of which service I use.

Or explain to a child that they have a 70 minute trip but nowhere to draw or play a game. And forget using a laptop and referring to notes.\nIt does work well, though, where two rows of seats face each other with a gap where the table should be - as evidenced on my journey the gap is just the right size to sit on one side and prop feet on the other.\nThere is no longer the option of First Class. Where it has gone on the St Pancras/Corby line I don't know but it was another sometime treat which has disappeared.\nAs stated by someone else, there is no way to know which seats are booked and which are free.\nCatering has gone but I am hoping this is temporary because of Covid.\nTrain journeys used to be fun, now they are to be endured\nIn fairness, the trains were clean and on time.",

After travelling with EMR regularly, I am shocked with my experience today. \n\nIn summary, seat reservations were not displayed above seats, so naturally people sat where there is space including myself as my seat was taken already. There were plenty of seats not in use for others. \n\nOn arrival to Kettering, the most unpleasant and obnoxious couple boarded, had the most entitled attitude I had the displeasure of witnessing and were shouting at passengers, demanding people to move out of their reserved seats, meaning an elderly couple then had to give up their seats and relocate. Where did common decency go? If it wasn\u2019t for the generosity of other passengers, this couple wouldn\u2019t have been able to sit together for the duration of their journey. I am absolutely appalled - is this how the older generation is treated?! In the end, this disgraceful couple got their demand and other passengers actively moved away from them and sat in any random seats, I myself moved to another carriage, as they made everybody uncomfortable and frankly angry. I understand such rude people can not be avoided, however it seemed as if the staff on board had no idea how to handle this kind of situation I would expect for a train provider to be more organised and learn how to deal with disruptive and inappropriate passengers appropriately. As a young female who regularly travels alone, it is this kind of behaviour and this failure of management that leaves me doubtful to use this service as regular. \n\nI hope that this can be dealt with better in any future similar situations!",

So remember this next time you need to buy tickets. Maybe get printed out tickets. Trainline will only deal with cancellations. They even phoned EMR to try and sort it out but came up against a brick wall. The link they sent me you have to be a season ticket holder which I am not. It won\u2019t back date my claim to the 9th May 2022. All EMR keeps saying under data protection even when I sent them all my paperwork my receipt and even a piece of paper from the Grantham station chap explaining that out train was delayed by 48 minutes they refuse to deal with me.",

        "review_text": "I've gotten to the point where I actively avoid tickets that have a connection via EMR, and you should too. Here's why:\n\n- Frequently cancelled trains. From my experience alone, they've cancelled around a half of every trip I've taken with them.\n\n- They will let you wait before cancelling. Was on one of their trains. Waited 10-15 minutes after the departure time, they then decide to announce the service is cancelled due to there being 'no available driver'. Why they waited 10-15 minutes to declare this is absurd. This meant I missed my connection train, and an alternative train I could've taken.\n\n- Trains are filthy, old and way too small. Seriously. I've seen steam trains less filthy (and more reliable!) than these.\n\n- Always take the minimum amount of carriages for a trip. It's genuinely like they only have 2 carriages in service in the entire Midlands, it's crazy, they'll turn up with 2 carriages (with driver seats on either end, so not full) and expect this to satisfy a service with 12 stops.\n\nGlad to hear this useless excuse for a train company is being bought out and hopefully fully engulfed by Greater Anglia.",

The only reason for deducting one star is due to a rude member of staff at your Sheffield ticket office who told us we wouldn't make it to London and we were stupid to try - totally unnecessary scaremongering when we were already stressed enough. I understand you were advising against travel, however, some circumstances don't allow for plans to be moved.",

One member of staff was patronising & referred me to T&cs on flexi ticket in that they can\u2019t transfer funds from lost to new smart card - oh and apparently the t&cs on flexi card are different but they neither draw your attention to it, it isn\u2019t in smartcard literature & isn\u2019t there at point of sale so my view is they can\u2019t incorporate that into the contract- absolute useless bunch of cowboys",

When the train Manager came through to check tickets he was not very nice complaining about holding the doors it was pointed out about the platform change he wasn\u2019t interested saying the train would be late.The train arrived 9 minutes EARLY at Bedford sat in the platform for 12 minutes and left 3 minutes late. This is not the first time this has happened as customers have had the same problem the week before ,they tried to get on the train the Train Manager asked them to step back from the train and when they did the TM just departed the train knowing full well how long it is for the next one.\nThe next train from Wellingborough for those who missed this train due to the ignorance of the train Manager is 67 minutes away if it\u2019s on time.When I complained to EMR they were not one bit interested saying the Train Manager was not allowed to make the train late. I was always under the impression that the train service is there for the customer paying nearly \u00a37,000 per year for a ticket I for one will be communicating by car when my season expires EMR connect are a joke and most of the staff (not all) are awful.\nThe trains are uncomfortable unreliable 20 year old junk as they are always being cancelled or being run as a 4 car in peak time using the excuse that the train has developed a fault ridiculous.",

        "review_text": "St Pancras to Derby, Sunday 14 November 2021 Scheduled departure 14.59.\nKnowing that seat reservations were unavailable on Sunday departures to Derby from St Pancras, we arrived at the platform about 30 minutes before scheduled departure. The train was already quite full but we did manage to find seats for our party (3 adults, 2 children). By the time of scheduled departure the aisles were filled with standing passengers as were the doorway areas by the toilets.\nBecause of the delayed arrival of the train manager, the train\u2019s departure was delayed by 25 minutes. During this waiting time, announcements were made advising passengers to transfer, if possible, to a Nottingham train, which, at ten carriages was twice as long as ours. Putting a five carriage train on a busy Sunday afternoon service is unacceptable.\nAs the journey progressed, some of our party went towards the toilet but found it very difficult first to squeeze past standing passengers then because of passengers sitting, and, in one case, sleeping in the doorway area. After leaving Long Eaton, the last stop before Derby, I went to the doorway luggage rack to sort out our suitcases. Because of the standing passengers this was a very difficult task and I only just completed this before the train reached Derby.\nThe whole journey had been a very unpleasant experience. I am a frequent user of public transport (buses, trams and flights) and in none of these do I experience anything approaching the unregulated overcrowding which is seemingly the norm on your services. Your trains are also the filthiest means of transport. The seats are uncomfortable and dirty. The toilets are uncleaned. The floors are filthy The bins are overflowing. We noticed arriving at St Pancras on our outward journey that passengers were boarding our train as we left the train meaning that there was no scope for cleaning the train between journeys.\nYour fares are also mile-for-mile the most expensive.\nYour company has taken on the East Midlands franchise fairly recently. You should not have taken it on if you did not feel you would be able to provide a satisfactory service. If there were problems when you took it over you have had time to rectify them.",

I immediately felt upset about the amount of money I spent on this train knowing I would have to sit in this for next 3-4 hours. It seemed that the air con was not working. It was clear to see that other passengers had complained and a member off staff put their hand up to the vent and said \u2018air little is coming out\u2019 and that there were no issues. That was that.\n\nThere were no charging ports and declined to use the toilets in fear of catching something.

It's irresponsible and just spiteful.  Never had an email to even confirm the cancellation- i can't even trust them to do that. And I had to rebook and pay first before cancelling.  Never, ever using them again.  Just awful. Why, as a business would you think anyone would use you again after this.",

Offered one cup of tea and a biscuit on each leg of the return journey, train seats dirty (covered in crisps leaving London St P), staff care and pride in the First Class service low. On the return journey 2 members of EMR staff were also sitting in the first class car and getting better service with free drinks and snacks than the few customers. The price has stayed the same for this service but the level of customer care and the service provided has massively declined. The train on the return journey clearly had some sort of technical problem as when it reached a certain speed the carriage juddered so much - due to what feeled like something wrong with one of its wheels under where I was sitting - that it was impossible to work or drink the one cup of tea they had given me. I travelled first class so I could work on the train and this was not possible on the return journey due to this problem. Very very disappointed in EMR! Filed in the online questionnaire but I cannot imagine anything will result from that!",

The announcer on the train even apologised for only being two carriages, he announced there were supposed to be four but he said he had no idea why two were taken off. Two other trips were delayed because staff were taking alloted breaks, another because there were insufficient staff and today we've been left sat on a platform for an hour on my daughters birthday before finding out online that the train had been cancelled after it broke down a couple of stops before ours. There was no info in the station, in fact the info board was just chucking out garbled info about nothing. I feel sorry for the staff who generally seem to be doing their best, a friend who works for them admits he's embarrased to tell people due to the amount of complaints he gets.

        "review_text": "Long story short. Of my journey, one train was cancelled and the next one was in such a delay that we got stuffed like animals in 2 coaches on the first, already overcrowded, available train. On the PA was repeated several times that we could claim a compensation about the very poor travelling conditions on line or at the station. We did on line and, via the channel reserved to overcrowded trains, we were in contact with a Lady who kindly said: Sorry, it can happen. We don't compensate these problems. Full Covid lockdown and we were touching elbow and breathing the same air with dozens of people.\nClaimed also the cancelled train and the delayed train, all at the origin of the overcrowding.\nCancelled train: reply, there was not enough evident quantified delay. How can you quantify a non existing train? Second one: not enough delay. Again, reason of overcrowding and I don't think the trains we were supposed to take are running with such frequency!! It is not the London underground....If we were passengers for 2 trains in the same one means that the delay passed the standard time schedule (I thin 1 train every half hour or more). 2 days ago I receive a new message. EMR cannot process my claim because I have not submitted spoiled tickets; I have to submit them within 7 days to validate my claim. I have already done TWICE. With patience, I tried to submit the spoiled tickets again today. Not possible, this claim is rejected, open a new one. First, if it was already rejected, why do you write to me? Second: I cannot open a new claim, the ticket was dated more than one month ago and these fraudulent gentlemen have spent one month asking documents I already provided....\nWhat it is hurting is that they hope that, with their complexity and maze of unnecessary steps in the website, people gives up and they keep the money they don't deserve. They did not provide any service but posed the risk of a further contagion. Fortunately, I have my pride and time in my hands now. So, after being treated like cattle stock with the risk of Covid-19 and pulled around, I am not accepting it.",

Every single train seems to have different colouring and wording. I think the wording makes sense in terms of type of journey, i.e intercity (longer) but also is a sign of the quality of the train, the regional being the worst of the worst.

It is only a week from my intended date of travel. I applied for a refund and was charged \u00a310 for the privilege of avoiding serious inconvenience!! So - I turned to Twitter to ask why this should be. The initial response could have been drafted by a robot (and probably was) in that it did not address my question at all. The second response was from a human. The third response was a \u201cshoulder shrug\u201d and a link to make a complaint! Unbelievably bad customer service. Frankly, I cannot be bothered to go through all that hassle for the sake of \u00a310, but I can be bothered posting on here and Twitter to warn intending passengers of this sharp practice from EMR. They need to understand that regular commuters have long memories and plenty of alternative modes of travel. This incident has lost EMR literally \u00a3100\u2019s. I hope they think it\u2019s was worth it (if indeed they even bother to read reviews on here).",

        "review_text": "Train left on time. Reasonably clean and tidy. Polite staff. Arrived in Nottingham from London a few minutes late.\nTwo issues spoilt the journey. Firstly diesel fumes were present in the passenger compartment throughout the journey. I took the train in part to avoid using the car but was reminded what an environmental disaster these diesel trains are, and on this occasion bloody awful to be sat in.\nSecondly the Covid policy of making everyone sit next to a window is poorly thought through. When we entered the train everyone spaced out. After repeated announcements we were forced to move. Couples are unable to sit side by side in 2 seat spaces instead having to sit facing one another in 4 seat spaces. But because all of the 4 seat spaces are clustered at the end of the carriage we moved from being perhaps 10-15 foot from the next nearest passenger to about 2 feet from the next nearest passenger, back to back, whilst the centre section of the carriage was empty. Announcements said that this was for the safety of people passing through the carriage but the only people moving through the carriage were ticket inspectors and potentially people going to the toilet, although on this journey no one left their seat. I fail to see how forcing people to sit clustered together for 2 hrs is safer than allowing the odd person to move through the carriage and momentarily pass another passenger en route to the toilet. Effective ticket inspection on entry and exit would negate the need for staff to move through the train during its journey. In any case staff still have to come within a few feet of passengers even if they are sat next to a window. This decision appears to be entirely revenue based, as a token gesture to staff expected to inspect tickets. However forcing staff to continue on board ticket inspections and the prioritisation of revenue over everyone's personal safety is distasteful and unnerving.",

At that time the advice was that tickets which had been received by post should be posted back for a refund and so I did so. Several weeks later, having not received a response or a refund, I checked the website to find that they now have an email contact address for refunds. When I contacted them they refused to refund me because I hadn't made an online request within 28 days. So EMR have decided to not bother dealing with postal requests for refunds and then deny refunds to those of us who have been patiently waiting for them to do their job.\n\nUpdate: Having exchanged several emails of complaint EMR have said that they expect to check post over the next 10 days and have asked if I sent it recorded delivery. It seems that they're now preparing to deny my refund by saying that they didn't receive my letter. They have all the details of my journey, they know I booked the tickets, the tickets were clearly for a leisure journey for 2 people one of whom has a senior railcard, and as such the journey could not be taken under the rules of lockdown. There is no reason to refuse my refund!",

They were told which platform the train was before people who actually had the tickets for the train. Therefore we had to stand for a what should have been a 2 hour journey. On top of the fact we were standing with lots of others, we had a half an hour delay which meant we had to stand for 2 and a half hours in cramped spaces! For the price of the tickets this is absolutely ridiculous. After telling the customer services they simply said; there is no compensation for standing as you didn\u2019t reserve a seat. 2 reasons I had a problem with this. When purchasing the ticket they did not mention that you may have to stand the entire time. The other reason is that they had no care for the fact there was essentially double the amount of people on the train due to cancellations of other trains. They have offered compensation for the delay only however, I think this is appalling! I 100% will never be travelling with EMR again. I would much rather pay a fraction of the price for a guaranteed seat on a coach even if it is a 4 hour journey instead!",
