        "review_text": "My girlfriend and I have recently returned from a trip to Scotland and had a great time in Edinburgh and a tour around the highlands.\n\nI looked at various ways of getting to Edinburgh from London and choose the Caledonian Sleeper train, the berths seemed overpriced, so, decided to get the chairs thinking the chairs must be reasonably comfortable for an eight-hour overnight trip.\n\nBut how wrong was I, I\u2019ll start by stating the positives, the carriages are clean and tidy and the trains run on time, they give you a night pack consisting of an eye mask and ear plugs and there is a reading light and charger socket for your phone.\n\nNow the negatives, they have made no attempt to make the chairs comfortable, they are as hard as stone. The chairs move forward a little but the backrest stays upright with no recline facility, if you try to rest your back on the window with your legs across the floor the arm rest (that doesn\u2019t flip-up) sticks in your back.\n\nWhen they dim the lights there are led spot lights on the ceiling that stay on that shine directly In your face.\n\nDuring the night it gets cold, there is an air vent below the window that pushes out cold air all night long. I would recommend taking a warm blanket.\n\nIt\u2019s also noisy, however, to be fair I expected that, but what I didn\u2019t expect was a uncomfortable freezing night on up-right hard chairs with little hope of getting any sleep at all.\n\nI will not be using Caledonian Sleeper again as I have no wish to go through that 8 hour torture ever again.",

The train is very noisy so don't expect to sleep well. The food is mediocre and cheap. The worst thing of all was we had no water from 6am so couldn't shower or clean our teeth and even worse was we couldn't flush the loo after doing a number 2. Utterly embarrassing.  The staff were friendly and the return journey was marginally better. This had been on my wish list for 50 years and a major disappointment. ",

On the day of travel, we\u2019d already travelled 5 hours to get to Glasgow and received a text while in Glasgow to let us know the lounge wouldn\u2019t be available at the Glasgow side. I emailed the company on our return to let them know it was a disappointment and inconvenient that we were unable to use the lounge at Glasgow  to be told that they had let us know this was unavailable in ample time, there was left luggage facilities we could have used at Central Station and we could have eaten at Central Station too - all at our own expense of course! Poor customer service and attitude. \nIt\u2019s also not clear on arrival at Euston where the lounge is, there was no signs when we got off the train to point us in the right direction. We were all so tired at this stage that we went to our hotel and paid to get into one of the rooms early to get ready for the day.\n\nOnboard, we couldn\u2019t fault the staff, they were attentive and very helpful. The cabin itself was tiny and very loud and uncomfortable during the night. We\u2019ve now done it once but wouldn\u2019t do this again, especially given the aftercare attitude.",

However, only upon embarking the train was I informed that the night's sleep will be interrupted gently at 1am and everyone will have to move to another train, and be able to go back to sleep immediately.\n\nWe arrive at Edinburgh for the change. Wait for a long time on the train, then we are asked to leave the train but have to wait in the cold for almost 20 minutes. So any chance of going back to sleep is gone. But that's not all. We then stay put for two hours before anyone bothers to tell us that we're going to stay there at least until 4am and arrive at least 2.5 hours late to our destinatiln.

It all felt civilised, relaxing and more environmentally friendly than flying. The complimentary bag of ear plugs and eye mask was nice but felt a bit wasteful. All in all, better than flying.",

New room no ensuite which was needed for y autistic son. Chasing for a room was not what I should have had to do during that time. Arrived 45mins early, before breakfast, then they try to rush you off by saying they're closing the doors and getting ready to depart at no point saying that you have until 7.30am to disembark. People rushing off train, dazed and confused. I broke my toe rushing to get down the ladder after one of these announcements. Vegan breakfast was not vegan. \nIf you're looking for a once in a lifetime treat and introduction to the magic of sleeper trains, or even just a 'good enough' experience then look elsewhere.",

Despite the summer evening chugging by outside - inside the coach was Baltic thanks to the overachieving air conditioning. After several brave passengers complained, their frosty breath still hanging in the air, we were each given blankets - one hour before our scheduled arrival in Glasgow.

The seats were comfy enough upright, but only reclined about 2 degrees from upright, and it was impossible to sleep without one's head nodding forward, which isn't comfortable at all. It's advertised as a sleeper seat, but no way would you describe it as such after using it. Very false advertising, and a rip off price of nearly \u00a3400 for two. Extremely dissappointing experience, and never again. Even the conductor agreed with me, saying though, don't worry, when you're tired enough you'll nod off, most people do!",

Food surprisingly good. But there were very few passengers on our journeys.\nAll in all, a reasonable experience. You just need realistic expectations of how much sleep you will get.",

I took my noise cancelling earphones which was a good move as there was a noticeable track howl most of the way up which was significantly reduced with my earphones.

I was only given a 33% refund when the difference in price between a room with and without a toilet and shower is 50% (I was told by staff on the train I would be receiving a 50% refund); meaning I had to spend nearly 2 days without showering. I was also disturbed several times by the staff taking pictures of the fault. Just to add the breakfast is awful.\nDon't waste your money fly and stay in a hotel for the night, its a lot quicker and costs a similar price.",

We have travelled north to our second home near Inverness and back to London many times on the old Sleeper over the last decade so we were excited to try the new carriages. It was a huge disappointment. Despite earlier feedback, the old fashion officious check in system remains unchanged. The new club class cabin  'room' looks good but the design has not retained sensible things like handles on the wall to get down from the top bunk.  The night lights are very bright and cannot be dimmed.  The top bunk has an uncomfortable edge.  The loo causes the toilet roll to become damp during the night. Delight at having a shower was dashed as the water remained cold despite running for 10 minutes.  Even with Covid, we will probably fly next time, which is really sad as we much prefer train travel. These things could and should have been resolved.",

There was no Caledonian staff present, and their stand was abandoned. Our altered timetable wasn't reflected on the departure board, and National Rail staff had no info on any changes. Luckily, cleaners and assistance crew knew more than info desk staff, and we found out where the train was and where to find the crew. There was no change to timetable despite online notice. \nOn the train, I found the cabin cosy, bottom bunk comfortable, and the sink sufficient. My partner did not enjoy the top bunk as he found it to be somewhat uncomfortable. The train ride was nice too, but I agree with reviews saying that the night light was too strong and we ended up using information cards to cover lights. I would like to use it again but not for that price.",

However, still no Caledonian Sleeper Staff to be seen! After getting cold on the platform were finally allowed on the train. Skip forward to 0600am. The train had broken down and was sitting just outside Preston (we should have been near London by now). The staff didn't have clear information for us, and there was no breakfast being served, not even a cup of tea! It was carnage.

I often used the seated class, but had occasionally got a cabin where the price was reasonable. \n\nHowever, on my most recent return journey, I was disappointed in the experience. The seated prices seem to have inflated significantly however were advertised as being suited to sleep. Unfortunately, the carriage remained brightly light, there were lots of noises (such as the toilet door announcing it was locking, etc) and there wasn't much legroom to get comfortable. There was a strong sense of being second-class passengers for sitting in seating - access to the food cart seemed to be discouraged for example.  The seats did benefit from a charger and reading light. The customer service (online chat) was mainly effective - although a delay repay refund did require some chasing to come through. \n\nWill probably just fly next time as it will be cheaper and a better experience.",

It is noisy and jerky -but that's just the nature of a sleeper train.\nIt is the customer experience that is flawed. Needs a lot of work. \nOnce you leave the berth and venture for an overpriced drink or bite in the dining car things go badly wrong.  The car is always full and there is not enough staff. On our last trip the wait staff (singular) were mainly unavailable but when they did have time to give some attention \u2013 wow, they were abrupt and unfriendly - verging on rude. Curt and short - as if customers were a massive inconvenience! \nQuite an uncomfortable experience. And we were keen to leave. Even that is hard. \nTech is terrible \u2013 takes ages for the (same single member of ) staff  to input the details of orders when it comes to paying and then you have to wait on \u2018being in a platform\u2019 (!) to get signal for the payment system to fire up.  \nWould never use the dining car again. Go straight to bed and eat the complimentary chocolate in the berth.  \nWould also think twice about taking the sleeper train based on that experience.",

Bed and bedding very good.\n\nFood is excellent and very good value for money. \n\nHOWEVER, organisation, reliability and response to issues are appalling.  Our train was running 3 hours late but we had no communication.  People in classic cabins had no options for food.  The train stopped and started and chugged along so that no one could really sleep.  But insult to injury they announced 3 hours after the train should have arrived in Edinburgh that they were not going to bother splitting the train and all passengers would have to go to Glasgow.\n\nAll passengers were thrown off the train in Glasgow Central with no information or directions and expected to find their way to Glasgow Queen St station and onto Edinburgh.  Many older and foreign passengers had luggage or mobility problems and no help was offered. We eventually arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours late..",

Morgenmaden vi fik var en t\u00f8r bolle, kaffe og en varm juice var alt hvad vi fik. Vi kunne udfylde en seddel over hvad vi kunne t\u00e6nke os, men 70% var streget ud. Vi havde k\u00f8restol og 2 kufferter og en rygs\u00e6k med, vognen det skulle v\u00e6re i blev frakoblet kl 4 om morgenen i Aberdeen (h\u00e5bl\u00f8st) Vi appellerede til togpersonalet om de ikke kunne finde et sted til k\u00f8restolen, de sagde klag til manageren!!!!Der manglede et lagen man kunne tage over sig, men l\u00e5 med h\u00e5ndkl\u00e6de istedet for. Fik kortvarigt klaustrofobi af at v\u00e6re i et lille varmt rum med al den bagage. H\u00e5ber aldrig vi oplever dette igen :-( Personalet ombord var ligeglade og gad ikke passagerne tydeligt at m\u00e6rke, talte med andre der var utilfredse. Den eneste ros er tjeneren i spisevognen, vi fortalte ham om vores problem jeg f\u00e5r jeg fat i en, og vupti kom k\u00f8restolen ind i et teknikrum til n\u00e6ste morgen.",

No other choices available.\nBreakfast delivered to cabin next day, our \u2018coffee\u2019 consisted of 2 cups of hot water with sachets of Nescaf\u00e9, sugar and milk.\nSat in exclusive lounge of train, order taken by a young man who clearly didn\u2019t want to be where he was.

They were eventually taken to a taxi from Edinburgh , one and a half hours after sitting stationary on the platform, leaving only 2 hours to make this funeral in the Highlands. Despite the huge delays that were known before we had even left London. The company failed this passenger more than most. \nBy then we had all had text messages informing us of automatic refund. \nNot much use in that travellers case. \nA shambles from start to finish, as we eventually arrived in Inverness at 1.30pm. Felt sorry for the staff. On the whole they are too good to have to work for this company. They appeared to have as little idea as us as to why a simple engine breakdown can lead to a 5 hour delay in reaching Inverness. \n\nIf you confined spaces, you'll be fine. The cabins are poky, the beds short and the windows do not open.  Fly or use the daytime train service as I usually do. I came off that train feeling as if I had flown half way across the world.",

        "review_text": "Uncomfortable in \u2018Classic\u2019 rooms i.e. bunk beds. Top bunk very difficult to climb in/out of and can only lay in it. Ride very bouncy and noisy. Cabin VERY narrow with little room for clothes so had to place them in sink thereby removing that facility. However, all this is more to do with the restrictions on British train sizes than anything. On one leg we had cabin with interconnecting door which rattled the whole time. This connected to a very loud couple next door who felt it necessary to whoop and shout both before and after their bar visit. One could have complained to the steward but she was as loud as them, shouting in the corridor. Maybe as they board, the steward could remind them of sleeping passengers and ask them to refrain from shouting, banging doors etc. Passengers appear to be randomly allocated to rooms so you have people alighting at 0500 who may want to go to sleep early next to passengers alighting 0800 who may prefer to stay in the bar and be a little raucous on their return. I was fortunate to get this at a fraction of the advertised price; if I\u2019d paid the advertised \u00a3500, I\u2019d be SERIOUSLY miffed (but you do get a free coffee. Well, a cup of hot water and a sachet of instant coffee.) Avoid and catch a regular train. This really is a poor, service.",

        "review_text": "Made an advance booking from Crewe to Inverness on the sleeper, 118 for a cabin outbound, 49 seat only return. Train arrived on time at Crewe and new comfy cabin. Bed and Bedding were very comfortable. All very new and smart. Scottish breakfast was ready at the booked time. The Carriages ride very hard so you feel a lot of track vibration. Managed 5 hours sleep then sat in the seats for the journey after breakfast, which you are discouraged from doing, the idea is that you return to the cabin sit on the bed . Return trip seated is less comfy. The seats are wide but hard, would benefit from aircraft style softer seats with proper reclining. Also not much food option so take your own food and drink. Take a small pillow and ear muffs as well if you use this option - not everyone sleeps through the night, although generally the seated carriage was quite quiet. No sleep for me on the way back, too uncomfortable. Biggest problems were the loco broke down both ways. So 2 hour delay at Stirling on the way, 4 hour delay by Livingstone on the return. This spoiled the experience. The Carriages are new but the loco's are old, and need to be upgraded and more reliable. To be fair by the time I reached both destinations I'd received an e-mail refunding both trips in full, so paid nothing. I'd use the service again but on advanced ticket with Senior rail card. Full price for a cabin both ways without the advance ticket but with rail card is \u00a3165 each way so quicker and cheaper to fly from Birmingham to Inverness airport. I'm hoping that as the train is new, services will improve over time, and the loco failures where just unfortunate co-incidences to have a failure both ways.",

        "review_text": "This is the first time I have travelled on the new sleeper in the seats. I am use to sleeping in aircraft seats (and just done an overnight in a long haul flight into Heathrow), however the seats are the worst seating I have been on for a very long time. The hard seat backs are  set rigid, curved back and tilted back very little. The bottom seat can be slide out a little and some seats have foot rest. The design is very uncomfortable to sit it. They seem to have learnt nothing in design of seating from the aircraft industry. Though they give you night shades something airlines seem to have cutback on, the lighting throughout the seater carriage always is always bright with strong lights  above windows. Aircraft dims their lights on long haul flights overnight, why cannot the Caledonian Sleeper? The only 2 positive things I can find to say about the new seated area is 1) there are now only 3 seats across, a single on one side and double on other and 2) the price for the seating is in line with that on the old sleeper (due to Government making it a condition of award of funding the Sleeper carriages).\nLastly:\n1) With Covid airlines in who's planes air is issued near ceiling level and sucked out at floot level and mask wearing it enforced, so very much limiting the potential of spread of virus. In contrast the seated sleeper air is generally issued at seat level and may be vented at ceiling vent. Few people were wearing masks.\n2) Turning to the sleeper bunk bed service. This new service fails to meet the needs of regular Aberdeen London traveller a) its twice as expensive as the old sleeper and uneconomic to alternatives, eg daytime trains or flights. and b) it is usually found be be fully booked if only booking a few days ahead.",

In short- because I really could write for ages - we met with rude staff on the station concourse - from complaining we didnt have our tickets out at the ready, to being told to put our golf clubs in our room (you seen the size of the rooms) frustratingly- she saw us walk 6 carriages to our room with our clubs and didnt have the courtesy to save the journey and put them in the travel compartment.  Then, drinks ordered from our room- 30 mins later, still didnt arrive- went to find out where our order was and was met by these rude staff again claiming no order was made ???????unbelievable. then he claims no food or drink was delivered to the train for that service.  Speechless.  in the morning, a coffee and bacon sandwich presented to our door- but no breakfast option as per the website service. Oddly enough, the bacon made it to the train.  Emailed later to complain, full of apologies from Evie re my treatment - will look into it -etc    reply came back several weeks later ( i had to chase) and I quote \" weve looked into it and dealt with it, cant divulge what we have done and wont offer you any compensation. Hope this is satisfactory and trust it will not put you off travelling with us again\"     \nHonestly - lost for words.  I have since rang back 4 times wishing to speak to the manager- Jane - still hasnt called me back.   Matter now with Ombudsman.   absolutely shocking service.",

Writing this review to balance things up as we had a genuinely wonderful trip that we will repeat - we now think it\u2019s the only way to travel to the highlands. Firstly, it\u2019s worth suggesting that don\u2019t have too high expectations, this is not the Orient Express, it\u2019s not perfect but for the money, a great value trip with some very pleasing surprises. \n\n- Wonderful welcome by friendly staff\n- Well appointed room, comfy bed and pillow (I\u2019m only 5\u20198 so tall people may disagree)\n- Hard seats in the club car but great service, good half bottle Cotes du Rhone and a cheese board, bliss, great service again.\n- on board WiFi worked well enough (Though I downloaded a movie ahead of time)\n- my wife used the ear plugs and eye mask provided and slept well, woken briefly a few times. I found it a bit harder, a combination of the back lit button on my control panel (which I covered with a T-shirt) and the jolting train kept me awake but I caved in and used mask and plugs and then slept well (a lesson learned).\n-waking up to the morning gloom of the highlands was unforgettable\n- you are supposed to order breakfast when you board which we forgot to do but the staff had extra (I guess they always get one like me) and produced a delicious highland breakfast (and that view!).\n\nNot the smoothest of rides but it\u2019s a train.. would be cramped for bigger taller people but all in all, this is a really terrific service and I will definitely be using it again!",

The \"shower\" was like a badly made cheap child's toy. 45 seconds of water then you have to push the taps again. Took five attempts before the water was tepid. The shower soaks the floor so if you go to the loo in the middle of the night you'll get your feet very wet! I was woken around 0100 by water pouring on to my face from a leak in the cabin. I had to get dressed and move all my stuff to another cabin, so not much sleep. The promised showers and toilets at the Virgin Lounge at Euston were not functioning and apparently hadn't been for some time. The ticket was \u00a3182. The refund was \u00a355, and I had to hold on the phone for 15 minutes just to get that authorised.  The three people who crewed the entire Glasgow to London sleeper that night did their best but it seems that management are simply not up to running a railway.",

        "title": "Awful breakfast and ladder rungs need padding",
        "review_text": "Breakfast:\nTwo years ago my husband and I took the Caledonian Sleeper from Inverness to London. It was during covid so we could understand the very basic breakfast that was included in our price. This time, however, we had different expectations and we looked forward to a nice breakfast in the club car. I had pre-ordered the salmon omelette with avocado and sourdough toast, which sounded really good. Sadly, it was appalling \u2013 the omelette was the size of the palm of my hand, was lukewarm and rubbery. It had clearly been made long beforehand. Then, not only was the accompanying avocado obviously very brown and overripe, but it actually tasted rotten! Luckily I had a very nice looking piece of toast to save the day \u2013 or so I thought! Alas it came with no butter and when I asked for some I was told there wasn\u2019t any. Really? Dry toast? Possibly one is expected to put the omelette on the toast to give it some moisture, but the omelette was so dry it would have helped diddlysquat. I heard other people also asking for butter but they too received a negative response. \nMy husband had the bacon roll. Once again no butter, simply a sliced white breadroll with 2 pieces of bacon shoved inside. No accompanying sauces either. He said it was like eating cardboard. I felt sorry for the people travelling on a non-inclusive breakfast who would have had to fork out \u00a35.25 for this!  \n\nBunk ladders:\nLast time we travelled we had the double cabin but this time we had the double bunks. My husband and I are quite small people so the bunks were fine for us and actually I found them really cosy to sleep in. However, be warned - you need to be quite agile to get on and off the top bunk, and to add to the difficulty the ladder rungs are very narrow steel which really hurts bare feet! Surely putting on a small bit of padding can\u2019t be that difficult?",

        "review_text": "I should stress this is a review about Sleeper seats not about a sleeper cabin. Warning! Don\u2019t book a Sleeper Seat!!! It may be cheap but it\u2019s a terrible experience. The seats do not recline. There is no headrest and worse still there are no wings on the seats. The arm rest cannot be moved and the seats are situated in such a position that you can\u2019t even rest your head against the window. \nWorst of all if you are in a Sleeper Seat you are treated like a steerage passenger on the Titanic. You are not allowed anywhere near the dining car and I was told I could not buy food to take back to my seat. There was no drinks service available. Thank God I had taken plenty of water. A terrible terrible experience rather like being in a prison cell for the night. Whoever designed the so called sleeper seats should be made to sit in one from Euston to Inverness and back! \nI have also travelled on this service in a berth. It was the old carriages.  I went from Crewe to Fort William return.as I boarded at Crewe at midnight. Obviously I did not have the same experience as if I had boarded at Euston. The return journey was good and I was able to sit in the dining car and have a lovely meal. It was rather lovely as the scenery is spectacular and it was like something out of an old film. \nI have heard horror stories though about the upgraded service ie even if you have a sleeper berth you cannot get into the dining car and when you eventually do there is no food available.",

        "review_text": "With so many reports of this service being unstable in its reliability, I decided to fly down from Inverness to London and chance my return by Caledonian Sleeper.\nThe train is scheduled to depart Euston at 21.15 with boarding at 20.30. A text message was received indicating boarding will not commence until 21.00. However no indication that boarding was commencing by 21.00 so we headed to platform one where a gathering of around 20 persons had already arrived. Staff could be seen speaking back and fore on there own radios.\nI just hoped there was no issues arising. Boarding was permitted by 21.25. Departure at 21.35. (20mins late, but ok with me as long as it keeps going).\nInside our 'classic twin' which is the same as old bunk compartment but smaller in width to the old cabins, a full length mirror on reverse of door to make it look bigger. A vertical ladder which will not be of use to many senior, frail or less active passengers. A cumbersome sink at the window (the old coaches was a fold up one) a pullout tray which sticks on return and 3 pieces of literature (menus, etc) which can only be left on top of your bed and then on the floor. The design inside is very much thrown together. A switch cluster has internal light press and call for assistance press right beside each other, yes in the dark you can easily call for assistance while intending to only switch the light on hmm!\nThe coach suspension is 'bouncy' and noisier than before like some sort of generator noise. The only improvement i could see was a better heating control.\nStaff are reasonably helpful but could enforce quiet speech when traversing corridors, so annoying and at midnight at Crewe a female steward started shouting at someone on the platform as if the person was deaf.\nIts a shame the service is so unreliable especially when the service it replaced was not always perfect but was stable.\nMy verdict is it needs to go back into a train operating company like Scotrail who can draw staff in emergency rather than Serco who use GBRF a rail freight company for the loco and loco staff with few staff north of the border.\nOh, and it really is over-priced.",

We were very excited for our very expensive Caledonian Sleeper experience given the fact the return costs were the same price as a holiday abroad! We were met at the platform by a very nice attendant who showed us to our cabin and then took our breakfast orders\u2026. Breakfast is limited due to staff shortages?? He then advised we are welcome to go along to the lounge for a drink, which we did\u2026 entered an empty carriage to be directed to a single table by the waiter\u2026. There were plenty booths however he wanted us as far away from where he and his boss were sitting so we couldn\u2019t hear him browsing tik tok! We ordered a couple of drinks and were told last orders at 12am my colleague and I then moved to a more comfortable booth to allow us to review business docs on iPad to be told \u201cwe don\u2019t allow 2 people to sit in booths normally\u201d\u2026\u2026 there was no one else in the carriage! We then decided to order a sandwich to take back to our room to be told \u201cthere is no food, only snacks, well only olives\u2026. Did you not get the text? It\u2019s because we are short staffed\u201d we then asked to order another drink whereby he looked at us like this was scandalous and said \u201cwell you need to pay\u201d (he never asked us to pay for the first round at the point) then looked at his watch (checking if it was 12am so he did not need to serve us!)(he had 13 mins before 12am and looked very annoyed at this fact!)  clearly very obvious the customer service is not important, nor is speaking to people in a polite and courteous manner, let alone providing the service advertised by this rail line! Absolutely shocking, a first time experience ruined by people who should not be in a customer facing role, we were not made to feel welcomed or relaxed in the first hour of our sleeper experience!!! Would not recommend!!!",

        "review_text": "Couldn't wait to try the Caledonian Sleeper service, using the new rolling stock, as loved the old ones we used from the 1980s onwards to and from Inverness and London. Now we live in Invernesshire, this seemed the best way to come back from London, so didn't get back in the dark at night, but in the morning, refreshed, instead. \n\nNot great at Euston, as only went up on board 15 mins beforehand, then a rush to find the platform and the right sleeping apartment. The Scotsman at barrier was charming, the attendant seeing us onto the train and ticking us off list, not so, on the rude side of disorganised. The standard sleeping room, two bunk beds, which we used to travel on, not that well re-designed, in fact the old design was better. The ladder is dead straight against the bunks, making it hard to get up to top one (used to be sloping and allow more space at bottom too). The hard metal stand for putting mobile devices in, against each bedhead, is a treat to head injuries. The padded sides that used to keep you safely in the top bunk as gone, the small thingey now replacing it, makes turning over in bed deadly. OK, we accept, not the real china cups anymore for morning tea/coffee, but the cardboard versions feel cheap and tacky and are they even recycled? I did manage the bathroom door, everyone else was complaining about getting in through the strange folding doors, but the loo was very noisy and nearly sucked you in too! The sleeping room was noisy due to the wheels sounding like they were coming off, didn't sound too safe and very bumpy compared to the old rolling stock. Could have done with mirrors and hooks in better places and just a lot more thought, this feels very basic, but an idea way to travel, which used to be a delight. The staff, very sadly, need some training in how to talk to people too, this makes so much difference to what should be a pleasant experience. However, managed to sleep, despite all this, as for some strange reason, I always sleep better in moving trains and ships that at home in bed!",

        "review_text": "\"Sleeper?\" Oh the irony.\n\nTravelled from London Euston to Aberdeen in late March 2022 with my partner. The double club room was comfortable, (when the train was stationary). \nThe double-ish bed was very comfortable and plenty of under-bed storage to fit a couple of suitcases. However, there's absolutely no room to move around. It took half an hour for our evening food order to be taken, when I complained the waiter huffed and muttered down his nose at us. He was generally abrupt and rude at the evening sitting AND breakfast. The journey was SO uncomfortable. You can't sleep on this train and it feels that the carriage isn't dampened because you feel every bump and movement. There was a continual whistling coming from the air vent that I had to shove a towel into to muffle the sound a little. However, as much as we tried we couldn't sleep, even with earplugs. The lights around the buttons on the instrument panel are too bright and totally illuminate the room at night.\nThe food, drink and service on this service is poor, it's overpriced, the food is bland and if you're vegetarian or vegan forget it, there's a singular option for you and you can't get a cooked veggie breakfast. I asked the waiter why wasn't there more options for veggies and asked what cooked breakfasts they had without meat who responded with \"You can have the Eggs Royale that's got salmon in it but no meat.\" \n\"Salmon IS meat\" I said, \"It's fish\". \"Ok, you can have Eggs Royale with no fish then\". The service ran on time but I would NOT recommend this service to anyone wanting a peaceful journey. The only good thing was waking up to the incredible Scottish scenery - other than that I would have given this review a one star. They need to bring this service into the 21st Century or just call it a day. For \u00a3240 a person we felt pretty ripped off and let down. Never again.",

You feel very much like the word comfort is so hard.\n\nWhen the trains had to be joined at Edinburgh nobody came to tell us why, nothing on the on screen display leaving a fellow passenger to fill me in. My family was wondering as this is different from other journeys.\n\nThen a passenger was very drunk and was making accusations to a fellow passenger about taking videos of content he shouldn\u2019t, he was very rude and called either the member of staff or passenger a \u201c racist c..t \u201c which is not acceptable. They was debating this with him for nearly 40 mins about what he did and drinking alcohol. Now they didn\u2019t remove the accused passenger. \n\nWe was left with a man whose behaviour was intimidating, and could therefore turn on other passengers including ourselves. Then we had to wait to leave as we was told we couldn\u2019t leave the door they waited on BTP. But they left us with the passenger totally not caring for our safety or checking how we felt. He should have been removed at Newcastle where we stopped but he wasn\u2019t. Imagine how scary that would feel if it was yourselves. \n\nIt was combination or that and people playing on the next night back home to glasgow of people at 3am watching Spanish soaps loud and lying across the floor H6B/C and the guy from 2C constantly walking up and down the carriage very freaky. This made the journey not fun or relaxing. It\u2019s like we do plan to use the service in the future maybe the rooms but the seats for \u00a3277 as I said wasnt fun or enjoyable. \n\nWe only just finally get the sleep we need.

At just before 7am a knock on my door telling me train had broken down and to get all my belongings and go to buffet. No electric...no hot drinks...no heating...the failure of the electrics locked all the toilets. We waited 2.5 hours for road transport. The train had stopped at an unmanned tiny station....I wasn't offered any assistance and walked down 25 slippery stairs..it was raining and I had a bag in each hand so could not hold the rail. There were 12 passengers...we were put on a mini bus with a leaking roof the rain water had soaked the seats had to sit on that for 1.5 hours. What a way to travel in 2020. The return journey that night was replaced by a coach journey from Fort William to Edinburgh and you then got onto a train. How often is this happening. This incident wasn't reported on Thier website. They reserve the right to take up to 10 days to reply to your email. To top it all I've now got a severe cold. Just a nightmare!   Forgot to add I paid for a breakfast when I joined the train at Euston....didn't get it wasn't offered a refund because they couldn't open the cash register. B*lls*it!!!  \n\nSince I wrote this review there have been developments!!! The local newspaper covered it as a major story. Caledonian Sleeper refunded my complete fair and also offered me a free single ticket. I am of the opinion they were very sorry and I will give them another chance.

In the lounge there were free drinks (non-alcoholic), snacks, comfy chairs and fast, free wifi. \nAbout 20 minutes before departure I went down to the platform where I was met by a couple of friendly staff members who gave me a keycard for my cabin. \nInside the cabin itself was big enough for one person, I could put my bag and shoes under the bed, there was charging ports, heating dial, dimmable lights as well as a sink with toiletries and a spray to make your pillow smell nice. There was also an en-suite which could also be used as a shower room, very convenient in the middle of the night when you don't want to roam the corridors looking for a toilet! You also got ear plugs and a sleep mask. \nThe bed itself was comfortable and of good quality, there was enough length that a person of my height - 6'4 - could 'just' stretch out, though my feet were up against the wall. The rocking motion of the train wasn't too bad, and the only noise was that of the train tracks. My only complaint really is the width of the bed, I'm quite broad shouldered so I felt a little confined in movement with the bed. The wifi onboard isn't the best either, so for streaming on Netflix I had to just use 4G on my phone. \nCome morning I went along to the Lounge car which was very nice and comfortable, and had my complimentary breakfast which was served at the time I'd requested on my card the night before. Breakfast was delicious as was the coffee. \nAll in all it was a pleasant experience, though if I were to do it again I think I would try to get one of the double beds just so I had space to spread myself out a bit more!",

        "review_text": "56% of reviews are 1 star and 15% are 2 star so 71% of reviews are bad - why?  Misleading advertising, overpricing, an uncomfortable and sleepless journey, cramped conditions with a toilet with a mind of its own, this is certainly not a premium product, although at \u00a3410 ONE WAY you are certainly paying for one.  I have spent the best part of three months going backwards and forwards with Caledonian Sleeper and the Rail Ombudsman, as I made a formal complaint.  Their decision was final, but it was the wrong decision as it did not address their misleading advertising, uncomfortable journey and lack of any sleep.  I have attempted to instigate proceedings against Caledonian Sleeper via the Claims Court only to find that as they are based in Inverness, Scotland and not in England - there is no way I can sue them using Moneyclaim online.  So, the only recourse I now have is to leave honest reviews online so that others don't go through what we have gone through. \nIt is shameful that their advertising and marketing is so far from the truth, and there is nothing which can be done apart from asking my bank to process a chargeback.  Caledonian Sleeper are charging customers ridiculously high amounts to travel and the experience is far from ideal and certainly not as their advertising suggests \"wake up feeling refreshed\" what a joke - if you get a wink of sleep - that would be one more than we got.  You don't need to believe what I am saying as 71% of reviews left on Trustpilot all can't be wrong with awarding just 1or 2 stars - if there was an option to leave no star I would.",

        "review_text": "As someone who used to love and regularly travel via the Cally sleeper, it pains me to write this. However, the journey I had last week was one of the worst i have ever had. For \u00a375 (and no ability to use a 26-30  railcard - why???) I booked one of the seats (bunks were a. sold out and b. extortionate at a *minimum* of \u00a3175), which in itself should not have been an issue, although it does seem strange that an overnight chair (with the journey taking 8hrs) should cost *more* than a normal chair during the day (taking 4.5hrs). However, upon arrival it got worse and worse. In summary: 1) the lights are on full brightness all night, with no means to turn them down or off. This in-built piece of design genius is apparently to ensure \"staff safety\". What about putting strip lighting on the floor, like on an airplane? Or even just dimming them a bit so that it less resembled sitting inside a filament lightbulb??? 2) The aircon. The carriage was cooled to a temperature more akin to a chilly day on Svalbard than is appropriate for a train journey. I ended up having to put two pairs of trousers on over my arms to stay warm, and even then was shaking with cold all night. It was bizarre, and completely unnecessary. 3) I fail to understand why seated passengers cannot use the restaurant car (though I appreciate this was also the case on the old trains - but still wrong). It was practically empty (understandably - most occupants were tucked up in their double beds!!!) and it seems baffling to keep the 'Great Unwashed Seated Class' in their carriage where the staff have to come and hand deliver their orders (hence keeping the lights on full beam). The staff were just doing their job, but I feel for them as they clearly get these complaints on a regular basis and are powerless to do anything. I would love nothing more than for the Sleeper to become to joyful, incredible journey and experience it once was and should be, but at the moment (in the seated class) it couldn't be further from the truth. Please please please @CaledonianSleeper take note and improve the experience - I would love to see how your executives react to a night in the Seated class and how quickly things might change!!!\n\n*oh and how could I forget, we were delayed by over an hour!!!",

        "title": "Air conditioning broken, pre-ordered breakfast not available",
        "review_text": "The air conditioning was broken on my outward journey. According to the attendant it had been broken for some time and he wasn't very pleased that it hadn't been fixed yet despite his pleas to higher powers for this to happen. I endured a very uncomfortable night during which I was either very hot or, having taken the covers off me and after the temperature had dropped, very cold. I woke up in the morning with a sore throat and hoarseness, and my voice hasn't recovered even now, 10 days later. I can only think that the reason it wasn't fixed in a timely manner has something to do with the fact that the trains are soon to be replaced. On one leg of the only other journey I have made with Caledonian sleeper, there was a problem with the ventilation which meant we had to sleep with the doors open to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Presumably some suit in an office somewhere decided it would be a shrewd business move to spend money on advertising the new fleet of trains, rather then rushing to ensure that customers have a comfortable journey in existing trains that will soon go out of use. No refund was offered for the lack of air conditioning.\n\nAdditionally, on my return journey the breakfast option I had ordered a month before when booking the journey (and also confirmed on the evening of travel) had run out, and I was given instead a limited choice of 2 options - if I had had any allergies or dietary/religious requirements I could easily have gone hungry. Luckily, as it was I was merely annoyed to have a less good option. Also the breakfast did not come with orange juice as specified. Perhaps this was a mistake but I didn't want to make it awkward by querying this in case the reason was they had run out of this too. I would have thought that if they allow you to pre-order food then they would ensure they had enough of each type of meal to cater for the orders, especially given that many people have dietary restrictions.",

        "review_text": "We travelled from Euston to Inverness in early July. We were really looking forward to the journey and had not read any reviews prior to our trip. We wish we had!!\nAs we were getting on the train we were told we were only allowed in the buffet lounge if all the seats were not taken by Club class passengers. Presumably we would have been  asked to leave if all the seats were taken and a Club passenger came in. Rather embarrassing. \nHowever we excitedly opened the door of our Classic cabin only to think that we had walked into a cupboard. It was so small we could only stand behind each other with the rest of the space taken up by the bunk beds. Very claustrophobic.\nSomewhat disappointing but we were only there to sleep and our bags fitted under the bottom bunk so we would make the most of it.\nClimbing on to the top bunk was not easy. I am fairly fit for a 74 year old but it was even worse coming down. The ladder is fixed almost exactly in the middle  so my wife had to decide how best to get into the bottom bunk as whichever side of the ladder she went she had to be a bit of a contortionist.\nWe finally got settled down and then the nightmare began. We have never experienced noise like it on a train before. My wife wears hearing aids and even with them out she was unable to get a wink of sleep. \nYou can imagine how bad it was for me. \nWhen the train stopped I just prayed that we might get off to sleep before it started again but it was not to be.\nAll in all certainly the worst travel experience we have ever had. \nPlease do not waste your money . There are better ways to get to Scotland.\nWhen I complained I was told that \" we were probably in cabins 1,2, 9 or 10 as they are right over the wheels. Actually we were in 8 but as the cabins are so small none of them are far from the wheels!",

        "title": "A bitter disappointment both ways",
        "review_text": "I've travelled on sleeper trains in the UK (Night Riviera) and in Europe, so I was looking forward to a trip to Edinburgh and back on the Caledonian Sleeper, without any unrealistic expectations of what can be achieved within the cramped dimensions of British rolling stock. I'd read some bad reviews of the new Mark 5 coaches, but went with an open mind.\n\nThings started off badly, when a text message arrived a few minutes before boarding was supposed to commence, explaining that the train had a software fault, and so boarding would be delayed by around an hour. Unfortunately, this message arrived just as all the station bars and cafes at Euston closed for the evening. We then had a miserable, and seemingly open ended wait in the bleak bowels of the station, with no staff to be seen and no announcements. Apparently there was a customer lounge somewhere, but this was only for higher class passengers - 'classic' berth ticket holders shouldn't expect a waiting room, after all, they're only paying \u00a3250 per trip...\n\nThe ride up to Scotland was awful. Apart from the carriages banging forward and back, and side to side, the bogies (which are directly underneath the 'classic' berths) bang against the underside of the train. When traveling round a bend (there are A LOT of bends on the West Coast mainline), the wheels seem to want to carry on in a straight line - causing a rapid vibration like driving over cobbles. At every crossover and set of points, the wheels hit the rail joints hard, with a bang, and it feels like the carriage is about to derail.\n\nAs I say, I've been on a lot of sleeper trains, and I actually enjoy the sensation of sleeping on a moving train, but this isn't it. There seems to be a battle going on each night, between the train and the track, and only one of them is going to win...\n\nWe forgot about the rotten journey up and enjoyed a week in Edinburgh, and hoped the journey home would be more like the 'hotel on wheels' advertised. \n\nNope.\n\nI've not stayed in a hotel before where the neat, folded towels are smeared with the previous occupant's make-up, or where the immaculately made sheets contain lovely long hairs neither my colour or length. Never mind - off to the club car for a bite to eat and a nightcap. The lovely friendly stewardess came over and listened to our order, before sheepishly explaining that due to a fault, there was no hot water in the club car, and so for hygiene reasons, they could only serve crisps and cold drinks. We opted for a couple of 330ml cans of beer, which at \u00a35 each, were only 350% more expensive than they would have been in the Sainsburys Local outside the station. We went for a bowl of olives to accompany the beer. I thought that it was a bit mean giving us eleven olives to share for \u00a32, surely they could at least given us a dozen so that we had six each. Although my partner pointed out that maybe the portion should have been ten, and they'd given us a bonus olive to be nice.\n\nThe journey south replicated the 'oh God, I'm trapped in the spin dryer, when's it going to end?' and 'I don't want to die in a derailment outside Lichfield' vibes of the journey north. We arrived in Euston half an hour early, decided not to indulge in a bag of breakfast crisps in the club car, and slunk off home. \n\nMy partner says she never wants to travel by sleeper again, which is a shame as I know other sleeper trains are far more comfortable, and far cheaper than the Caledonian, but after the trips we just had, I don't know whether I can even convince myself to brave this 'unique experience' again. \nSomething urgently needs to be done to address the frightening ride quality and constant technical issues of the rolling stock, which is only a few years old after all. The fact that Caledonian Sleeper management don't respond to any negative feedback suggests that this isn't going to happen. I suspect that any change of power in the Scottish Government will see this expensive service, which fails to be either a high end 'hotel on wheels', or a reliable, economic travel option for ordinary people, will be quietly binned.",

        "title": "Very Poor Design of Sleeper Rooms. Water in shower cold.",
        "review_text": "We were really looking forward to travelling on the new Caledonian Sleeper as have travelled on the older trains quite a lot and looked forward to the new experience. We were hugely disappointed though.\n\nThe rooms felt very cramped. We have travelled on the older trains but the new trains feel more cramped. The top bunk is situated too high so it's impossible to sit up in bed, there is no shelf for personal items (watch, wallet, glasses etc.) even though there is space for this. The ladder to the top bunk is completely vertical so it's very hard to climb up/down. We paid to travel in a Club room but was very disappointed that we could not use the shower as the water was way too cold (even after we ran it for a while to see if it would warm up but it didn't) so we paid for a facility which we could not use. It was already November (so a cold month) and then to have a cold shower is not appealing. There is a handy pull-out table but this blocks the entrance to the toilet when in use.\n\nAlso, the ride felt VERY bumpy. I could feel the bumps and jolts a lot more than the older Caledonian sleeper train. I also travelled from London Paddington to Penzance on the Night Rivieria sleeper train which was a lot more comfortable. The suspension on the new Caledonian trains seems quite poor. \n\nIt feels that the design of the train was not properly tested with real users otherwise why would the ladder be so vertical and the pull-out table block the toilet/shower door and lack of space to sit up. Where do management expect people to put personal items when sleeping - glasses, watch etc? A small shelf would have been ideal. \n\nOn the plus side:\n- Website booking process was easy to use \n- The staff on board the train were really good\n- Breakfast was good \n- Bar car was good (seats somewhat hard but may soften with time)\n- Food and drinks choices and prices in the bar car was good \n- The toilet in the Club room was really nice to have\n- We arrived on time\n\nOverall, in future I would fly - but if you can put up with the downsides this is a novel way to travel between London and Scotland and the staff on board were lovely.",

We wrote to customer services who did offer a small refund but at the prices charged it was nowhere near enough to make up for the stress - never again",

        "review_text": "Overall the services I was on were quite good. They ran to time and the staff were helpful.\n\nI only write negative reviews when something really irritates me, and here\u2019s what did with this service. I was told to fill out a breakfast card and leave it on my door handle, which I did. I clearly wrote that I wanted my breakfast in the room at 7:30. The guy said that might be too late because the train arrived at 7:49. I advised him that it was a room breakfast so would be packed up and easy to eat or keep if I decided to take it with me (like I did on my previous journey). He then agreed that 7:30 would be fine for that. At around 6:50 someone banged on my door repeatedly- they didn\u2019t get the hint after the first few bangs and just continued to knock.  When I finally told them I was busy (I was in the middle of getting dressed) she opened the door anyway and muttered \u2018but what about your breakfast\u2019. I pushed the door closed and told her I had ordered breakfast for 7:30 so to come back then. I didn\u2019t get the breakfast in the end because she obviously couldn\u2019t be bothered coming back with it. I\u2019m unsure why they need me to open the door for it in the first place- it comes in a tiny bag so they could easily hang it on the door handle.\n\nAlso, just walking into someone\u2019s room like that is hideous! I had no clothes on at the time, which is bad enough, but if someone was fast asleep it would actually be very frightening for them to have someone walk in like that. And all just to give them a breakfast? Absolute disgrace! You\u2019d think the train was on fire the way she let herself into the room like that! \n\nThankfully I didn\u2019t have to pay for my tickets, as they were booked for me, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t book any myself in the future. You\u2019d be cheaper getting an airport hotel for a night and then taking the earliest flight in the morning if you wanted to make the most of your time at your destination. \n\nIt\u2019s also pretty difficult to sleep on a train that feels a lot bumpier than normal trains. The beds are comfortable but the bumpiness of the train cancels that positive out anyway. I can understand why the sleeper reviews are so terrible! \n\nNew dining carriages are also very drab and look like they\u2019ve been designed by someone who designs old people homes! The food there was quite nice but I\u2019m told it\u2019s very unreliable. I actually found that to be true on my return journey as I was messaged to say there would be no hot meals.",

        "review_text": "I was very weary by the reviews everywhere of the Caledonian Sleeper and I was starting to think that maybe I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would! I was thankfully wrong.\n\nI travelled from London Euston to Inverness with my partner and caught the 2059 service. You are able to board the train around 30 minutes before departure which is great as you can put your luggage away and start to settle into your journey. \n\nBoarding was extremely unorganized. Herds of people just wandered outside the train with no information being given to passengers on how to access their room! My partner and I entered our berth for the 12 hour journey to Inverness. My initial thoughts of the room: very clean, cramped but cosy! The room wasn't cold or hot, a lovely temperature for winter. You are also given an amenity kit which consists of an eye-shades, earplugs and a water bottle. There is a control panel next to your bed, which has temperature control, a reading light, power socket, a button to call the host and many more which I can't remember! Once we familiarized ourselves - we tried to activate the lock on our door which took many attempts but we eventually got there. \n\nWe rushed to the dining cart to find out it was nearly full! We hadn't even left London yet! If you want to have dinner on the train, please go to the dining cart as soon you put your luggage away! The dining cart fills up very quickly. We luckily managed to get a booth but the waiter kindly asked us if we would mind sharing it as some other passengers wanted dinner and there were no more tables available! Obviously we didn't mind but please bear this in mind if you're expecting an intimate dinner with your partner! The waiter took some time to get hold of which was understandable as it was very busy already! All the staff I encountered were very professional, friendly and well dressed. I ordered the lamb shacks for the main course and the fruit platter for dessert, both were delicious and the portion sizes were acceptable. The wine menu was decent and the prices were also reasonable for train food, too.\n\nAfter dinner, we descend into our berth for the night. We had the twin berth. The mattresses were actually not too bad. They weren't as amazing as some luxury hotel mattresses but it was definitely more comfortable than what I had expected! The linen was extremely comfortable, warm and clean! I'm 6ft and I didn't find the bed cramped at all. The noises levels on the train aren't as bad as some people make out (well, I don't think so anyway) I managed to sleep for about 4-5 hours and woke up near Perth. My partner requested tea for breakfast (which is complimentary in all the berths) but sadly - he never received. \n\nAbout 10 minutes prior to arrival into Inverness - there was an announcement made to say we will be arriving into Inverness shortly. We arrived bang on time.\n\nIf you're looking for something luxurious like the Orient Express, perhaps this isn't it but if you're looking for something which will take you from London to Scotland in a civilized manner - then I would definitely recommend this. The only reason why I haven't given it 5* is because there were a few small things I didn't like, such as the buttons on the carriage doors made an annoying noise every time we alighted at a station! Not something you want to hear when you're trying to sleep! Other than that - I can't wait to travel on the Caledonian Sleeper again!",

        "review_text": "I travelled with my partner on the sleeper from London Euston to Edinburgh Sunday 19th February 2023. We had planned to do this for a long time and had saved up for the trip.\n\nThe problems started when we were in the lounge at Euston station, and there was no mention of our train on the departure boards, only one to Glasgow at the same time. I then received a text to say that our train was delayed and an announcement would be made at the station regarding this journey. No announcement was made and there were still no signs of our train on the board. I contacted customer services via live chat and they said that the train on the board to Glasgow was in fact our train as the Glasgow one had been cancelled. There were still no announcements and we were forced to leave the lounge at 11pm when it shut.\n\nWe then waited at the barrier to the platform along with the rest of the train. No explanation was given as to why the train was delayed. After around half an hour a member of Caledonian staff came down the line and said that he had no information as to the delay but asked where we were going. When we replied Edinburgh, he said we were 'lucky' we were not going to Glasgow - no apology was given for the lateness.\n\nWe eventually were allowed onto the platform at around midnight - an hour and a half later than planned and were told we could not simply get on the train but had to check in with a member of caledonian staff on the platform. We were totally aghast to hear that the person in front of us was told he could not travel as his carriage had been removed. This caused a great deal of stress for everyone concerned and further delayed those who were allowed to travel. Again no apology or explanation was given for this. Why this couldn't have been sorted sooner I have no idea. The handling of this situation was appalling - leaving people in London after midnight with no means to get to their destination.\n\nAfter eventually being allowed to board as our carriage was on the train, we went to the Club Car. Sat in the Club Car were two members of staff who appeared to be having a meeting and were talking 'shop' with papers out all over the seats. We had come away on what we considered to be a holiday and did not want to sit next to two people conducting a business meeting. The language being used by these staff was something more akin to what I would expect to hear in a working mens club with one describing a route he had to memorise as a headf***. Certainly not what I was expecting to hear when it is described on your website as 'a place for our guests to unwind ahead of a busy day at their destination' and 'the perfect spot to either relax with a late-night drink'\n\nWhen we returned to the clubcar for breakfast I have to say this was a disappointment as the food was all overcooked despite us being a few minutes earlier than requested on the breakfast booking form. Again the phrase used on your website 'our meals will make your journey unforgettable' is certainly not how we would have described it in a positive capacity.\n\nThis trip was something special for us as a treat and the issues we encountered and poor services definitely took the shine off our trip and we felt we had wasted our money. I sent an email of complaint to Caledonian and was finally offered an apology and a refund of just over \u00a340 which nowhere near covers the dissapointment (less than 10% of the price we paid). This trip was a one off for us, but just thought I would share our experiences if someone else is thinking of bookng this.",

        "review_text": "This was only the second journey I'd taken on the Caledonian sleeper, the first... back in October 2022, I booked a classic sleeper cabin... costing \u00a3200... on arrival at Londons Euston station, I was met by the Caledonian staff at the platform, I was excited to be travelling in 'comfort', enjoy\u00a0'bespoke complimentary toiletries\" and \"the option to purchase breakfast from our extensive room service menu\" the staff ushered me along, pointing me in the direction of my carriage.\nI opened the door to my cabin, it was small, 2 small, narrow bunk beds and a sink... not something for those that have a phobia of small spaces! I pulled back the bottom bunk duvet to reveal someone elses hair in the bed, and on the pillow... the mattress protector had blood on it, which could clearly be seen through the thin sheet. \nI went into the corridor to look for staff, but couldn't find anyone. The sink was dirty, and the bespoke complimentary toiletries amounted to a bar of soap. I was disappointed and tired. \nI'd received an email earlier to tell me that due to a lack of staff, the club car was not serving hot food. I made my selection from the room service breakfast menu, hung it on my door handle in the corridor, and lay on top of the bed... listening to the occupants next door ordering drinks to their cabin, they were told there was no cabin service tonight. The cabin walls were so thin that I could hear a group of lads further along the carriage larking around, one of whom announced his manhood was the sweatiest it had ever been... in fact, you could hear the rolling stock going over the sleepers and everything inside and out.\nI set my alarm, but I didn't sleep... on leaving the train the next morning, a member of staff I passed in the corridor asked if I'd received my breakfast order... I said I hadn't received anything, not even a courtesy call for my approaching station... he said he'd look into it.\nFor my second journey, and what will be my last on the Caledonian sleeper, I booked the seated carriage, costing \u00a370. I arrived feeling positive about this journey... but soon to be greeted by the same expressionless staff, herding us like cattle onto the train.\nMy seat was very hard, not the \"comfort seat\" advertised... the headrest pushed my head forward, pressing the button on the seat, only moved the seated part forward a couple of inches... it didn't recline the seat at all. You were still sitting upright and weren't at all comfortable. \nThe cabin lights remained on all night. Cold air was blowing out of the heating vents. The noise in the carriage was as though there was no insulation. You could hear and feel each bump on the rail. Come 5am, I hadn't slept, I was cold too so I went to the catering car. A couple of tables were laid out, with 3 cusomers sat having breakfast... the rest of the tables were taken with staff. I asked for a coffee... a member of staff got up from a single seat, so I sat down... the carriage was warm, so I was relieved to be able to sit somewhere warm and somewhat more comfortable... my coffee arrived, only to be told by staff that I couldn't drink it there because I'd come from the seats... it was takeaway only! \nI went back to my seat... looking at the station display in my carriage... \"Next Station\" has read the same station for a while now. I went online to check the CS timetable... it was now 06.40... according to their timetable, we should have arrived at the station displayed at 06.15? Long story short, I was taken to the train manager who hadn't realised the information displays weren't working. The train was, in fact, running 20 mins early, and that we had already passed the station I was supposed to get off at!! \nI couldn't bring myself to take my return journey on the Caledonian Sleeper for this trip... I was told it was too late to cancel, so I wasn't entitled to a refund. I booked at seat on Avanti West Coast for the return journey the next morning... a much better service.\nI will not be spending my money with Caledonian sleeper again.",

        "review_text": "I was so looking forward to this journey, having planned it months in advance.  We travelled in the seated area, which had been hyped-up by the marketing as a real alternative to the cabins (beds).  I know that seats are not a full alternative to beds, but......\n\nI managed to get half an hour of sleep at the very end of the journey, mainly because my body went into emergency shut-down through sheer desperation!  The seats are very very uncomfortable and the 'reclining' function is barely a slight tilt.  The leg room was appalling.  When going along to the toilet in the middle of the night, the sheer variety of sleeping positions adopted by my fellow (seated) travellers was like seeing a yoga class at their first meeting after having been given the instruction manual for the first time!\n\nThe toilet was full of pee and so, when my wife went to use the loo in the adjacent catering/club car, the staff pounced on her like the scene from the film, Titanic, where Leonardo DiCaprio's character is challenged when trying to leave 'steerage' class and escape from the rising waters through a higher class of accommodation.  A member of staff eventually allowed her to use the 'other' (classier?) loo and said that he would reset the first loo's electronics, which did clear the almost-to-the-brim level of pee in the loo back in our 'steerage' class.  [I then tried finding the Irish bar carriage (as per the film) where my wife and I could dance on the tables into the wee hours, but alas, this was a Scottish sleeper service!]\n\nThe train was excessively noisy considering the carriages are a modern design, although I suspect some of this is due to the track and not the train itself.  The supplied eye mask was effective but the ear-plugs, despite being a welcome addition, still allowed too much noise through.\n\nOn the plus side, the on-board 'guard' in the same passenger compartment as us was very friendly and welcoming throughout and did his best to reassign us to seats with marginally longer legroom.  He was a real asset to the company, to be fair to him, and deserves credit from his bosses!\n\nThe Business Model for this service seems fundamentally flawed in terms of the price and standard of the seated service and the huge jump to the prices for cabins with beds.  The \"Mark 5\" carriages are in use with other train operators and it would be quite simple to:  rip out all of the existing seats and dispose of them!  Purchase new, fully-reclining seats with more padding and better curvature around the edges.  Place the new seats back in the carriages with about a third of the seats missing and re-assign the seats with much greater distances between them to allow for reclining and for more appropriate legroom.  Yes, these \"Mark 5\" carriages have the ability to have the seats bolted down in a huge variety of different configurations, the holes for which are nicely hidden under the carpet, so let's not use 'it's too difficult' as a lame excuse for inaction!\n\nWith such new seats, passengers would happily pay the (currently) far-too-high ticket prices for far better reclining seats and you would get far more repeat custom.  Then, and only then, will your hyped-up marketing of these 'cattle-class' seats be more accurate and lead to an increase in patronage.  Alternatively, keep the current seats but advertise them as 'steerage' class and put up posters of old Leonardo Di-C in place of the current photos on your website.\n\nCome on Caledonian, get a team together in a room and sort this out.  You have a lucrative market to access and so much untapped customer base to target!  But with the numerous less-than-favourable reviews on this site - and others - many will continue to use other (seated) operators or fly (booooo, it's bad for the environment!) and book a hotel at the other end - which still somehow ends up being cheaper than your cabin prices!!!!!\n\nI am really gutted to have ended a truly excellent week in Edinburgh with my wife, by having to endure the worst train journey I have ever had - leaving me tired and certainly not 'refreshed' (as claimed by your marketing!) and having to have wasted much of today catching up on my lack of sleep from the previous night's journey with Caledonian.\n\nCome on people, get your act together and sort out this service that has so much potential.  Perhaps, as a start, why not try inviting real customers to work with you on this, rather than using some lame-##s consultancy firm that has about as much clue as a clueless thing!",

        "review_text": "My wife and I travelled from London Euston to Inverness on the Caledonian sleeper recently    We had purchased a club cabin and were very much looking forward to the experience.    The website promises a \u201chotel experience\u201d.   Dinner in the Club Car, described as \u201cthe beating heart of Caledonian Sleeper\u201d, was claimed to be a \u201cshowcase of the very best produce that Scotland has to offer\u201d \nWhat a major disappointment!   First of all, we had been told that we could reserve dinner when we checked in for the train and that could be done on the Euston concourse. Wrong, there is no check-in on the concourse.   Nevertheless, we were at the front of the queue but when we boarded we were told that there was no reserving and it was first come first served.    So, we left our bags in the cabin and went straight down to the club car but it was already full.     There was only one club car for numerous sleeper coaches and a single diner coach clearly had no chance of getting close to serving the numbers of people wanting to dine.     It seems that the people in the know (i.e. had travelled before) simply sent one of their party to grab a table before even going to their cabin (top tip), so there was probably no chance of first time Caledonian travellers like ourselves getting a table.    \nOk, so the diner was full but we were told that we could reserve for a second sitting which would be approximately one hour after departure.   This was getting late (10.30pm?) but if we wanted to eat and enjoy the start of our holiday there was no other choice, so we agreed.\nBack in the club cabin we also found disappointment.   Both bunks were ready for the night-time (i.e. top bunk down) so there was really no-where to sit comfortably while we waited for dinner.   Also, the cabins are unbelievably narrow.  With the bunks down the width to move in, out or around is not much more than the depth of a suitcase.\nAfter our hour we went back down to the diner and were delighted to find that a table was just coming free.   We were given the menu, which looked very nice, only to be told that they were sold out of almost everything.   The waiter had an interesting way of describing it.   For example, there were five items on the starter menu and he said to us (completely straight-faced) that they had everything on the menu tonight except\u2026..    He then reeled off four of the five items on the starter menu.   Similarly, there was almost nothing for the main course and no desserts left at all except a single child\u2019s menu brownie (which we had \u2013 two spoons).   Hardly \u201cthe very best that Scotland has to offer\u201d.  The same story for wine and drinks.   It was all so bad that all you could do was laugh in the end.  A true joke.\nWe went back to the cabin and then discovered that the toilet flush in our cabin wasn\u2019t working.   After several calls to the steward they appeared to get it working.  It worked for a while but then stopped again in the morning before we got into Inverness.  Breakfast was a cold bacon roll.\nI have travelled all over the world, including a variety of sleeper trains, and this is one of the worst experiences I have had when you consider the prices charged and the grossly over-hyped marketing displayed on the website, Facebook and elsewhere.    \nReading other reviews, I believe that this was not an isolated incident but similar to those experienced by many customers.    Blaming Covid for these events is not an excuse either.   There are several ways the events described could have been avoided but in each case it would have probably cost more money.   I am left with the impression that the management of the company is focusing on maximising profit rather than customer satisfaction. \nFinally, the staff on board were great.    They tried to do what they could to help but, it seems to me, the management of the company is putting them in an impossible position.",
