The trains are clean and the staff working in first class are funny, friendly and sometimes very generous with the complimentary refreshments.

        "review_text": "Claiming they've simplified tickets to get the best price for people is nothing more than corporate gaslighting. Let's look at the past prices.\n\nOnly a couple of years ago, a first class ticket to London from Aberdeen was \u00a3170 one way and \u00a3171 open return (the type of ticket they have removed).\n\nNow, a one way is \u00a3167... But because there is no open return you have to pay for two one way tickets totalling \u00a3334. Claiming the removal of open returns as a cost saver is lying. Ok, this is first class, so let's look at standard class for the same period\n\nOne way previously \u00a390, return \u00a3100. Now \u00a387.90 one way and \u00a3175.80 return. It is just sheer greed. A 95% increase in cost for first class and a 75% increase on standard class. How does that translate to \"simpler\" or \"cheaper\" fares?\n\nUntil this practice is sorted, I'll no longer be taking the train and I recommend anyone else doesn't either. It costs between \u00a380 and \u00a3120 per person to fly ABZ to LHR... Just fly.\n\nLNER, if you do read this, please feel free to reach out and explain how your misleading statement of cheaper fares stacks up to this more expensive reality.\n\n[edit following lner response]\nThese prices were advanced. You shouldn't need discounts to prevent the full price increase outlined. And thanks, your response clearly confirms the open return change was nothing but a money grab. ",

        "review_text": "Where to start really - attitude of the ticket collector was poor. Yes I got on the wrong train at London - made a mistake, not as a fare dodger as I had a ticket. I was made to feel like an idiot - your responsibility, make sure you check when it\u2019s such high jeopardy - \u00a3120 surcharge. On the one hand she was saying she had to charge for a full ticket (to York) and then on the other she was saying that I could pay the difference between what I had paid and the full fare at her discretion. I stayed calm and civil as I know that it is unreasonable on my part to be otherwise. I had to pay \u00a360 to get off at Peterborough and wait for the next train - not sure what LNER gain from this?  I understand that I had made a  (genuine) mistake but wow was I punished for it by being humiliated and charged, even after I had agreed to break my journey and get into York an hour later than the train I was on and 30 minutes after I could have done  had I caught the right train (as the train I should have got doesn\u2019t stop at York).\n\nI get that the consequence of my mistake was to be delayed - that way I don\u2019t get a higher price journey at a lower price. But I think it unfair that waiting at Peterborough for an hour wasn\u2019t punishment enough - I had to pay \u00a360 for that too. Spirit of Dick Turpin is alive and well in my opinion. You have nowhere to turn if you can\u2019t afford the extra fare and the ticket collector even charges you for getting off as soon as you can at your own significant inconvenience. The ticket collector was very quick to threaten me with the Transport Police but backed off even more quickly when I agreed as I thought they might be more reasonable - especially as I accepted that I couldn\u2019t get all the way to York on the train I was on.\n\nRailcards aren\u2019t valid either in this situation - I know it\u2019s the \u2018rules\u2019 but it doesn\u2019t have to be does it? Someone at LNER must have the ability for this process to be less draconian and Kafkaesque. \n\nI had two other London trips planned - will go somewhere else now and avoid LNER like the plague. Most companies support customers, not punish them twice for one mistake. ",

Pleasant staff who probably aren't paid enough to tackle all these criminals but tickets can be checked at stations where help is at hand perhaps.

As an essential form of transport, it amazes me how the cost of transporting a person from A to B can fluctuate so much. \nAside from that I had an experience that clearly demonstrates their disregard for their customers. A recent family holiday had to be cut short due to train strikes in France. Our group of five had to travel a day earlier than planned because of this, so I asked LNER on their chat service if we could move our tickets. They weren\u2019t interested at all in our plight. I understand that the strikes in France were not their fault, but some kind of empathy/humanity could sure have come in to play. \nLNER charged us \u00a3300 to change our tickets, including a \u00a340 fine for rebooking. This \u201cadministration\u201d fine is simply laughable, as I had to do the rebooking myself!\nTo make matters worse, when we boarded our train it was empty! \nSo thank you LNER for your contribution to our ruined holiday.

Obviously to justify charging more. Why can't they be honest that this is financially motivated. They tell us it is to \"simplify\" the process. Coz yeah it's so complicated to get a return isn't it. When I use the other operators it takes me all of my mental capacity to work out whether it is the outward or return journey. Thanks LNER for making this so \"simple\".

        "review_text": "I regret booking with LNER. New Years Eve - weather not good, services ending early for holiday and my train cancelled. I dashed to station early and was told I could only take the train before/after my cancelled one because that is \u201cpolicy\u201d. Am terrified of getting stuck over new year. Btw I travelled up on Lumo which had really good customer service. Wish I had booked back with them.\n\nUpdate - Happily I did make it home before new year but would still avoid LNER in future due to the inflexible rule which says you can only get the train before/after if yours is cancelled. If there is chaos, trains are ending early and there are spaces, why not allow people to use any available space to get to their destination? I suspect the staff shortages which caused cancellations on new year's eve are a regular feature of LNER.",

Especially if all the seats are booked, how can they sell more tickets to a pretty long journey than there are seats available?! This is just dishonest and frankly inconsiderate.

Vile, grasping organisation.\n\nResponse to LNER's reply: It WAS an LNER journey because we booked an LNER train, first class. The other lines have no business refunding us because we didn't pay for a ticket with them, let alone a first class ticket, and they actually GOT US TO THE DESTINATION albeit over 3 hours late.",

A big thank you to all staff involved. It was an epic task undertaken with professionalism and great customer service.

However the excuses for not supplying the advertised hot food vary, but usually involve the temperature controls on the fridges not working, or the food not arriving at Aberdeen, or being frozen solid. I don't understand why LNER can't replace the faulty units, or change suppliers. So today we were offered Beef Olives on the menu. Then we were told no hot food after Dundee. It transpires they need a chef in the kitchen (a bit like Faulty Towers - to open a tin) but they don't employ chefs north of Edinburgh. I was on a packed 1st class train today with a lot of disappointed passengers. This does nothing to encourage travellers to leave their cars or planes and use what is otherwise a very good service.",

Bring back The Great North East, the inventors of the railway, pack your poor service up and retreat back down south. Shambles.  Also, on Saturday I got on a train from Newcastle to Durham. You made an announcement that the last 4 carages wouldn't leave the station. So everyone got off, leaving no space on the train. So many people had to wait, then you had the nerve to leave the station with all carages in tact. Subzero temperatures and another hours wait for the next train.

After boarding the train, when the ticket inspection man came, I explained the trouble but he threatened to charge me for another ticket. In the interest of avoiding an argument, I did not escalate on his condescending talk and reply to his opinion that I should have got \u201chandwritten a note\u201d from the staff at the gate. The subpar attitude, thinking that I was travelling \u201cillegally\u201d and I was still allowed on the train as a result of his perpetual grace - is really embarrassing.\n\nI do not understand what I could\u2019ve been done so that I was travelling \u201clegally\u201d.  I am not suggesting LNER starts a worldwide search for employees with Einstein level IQ or Nightingale\u2019s solicitude. Surely an employee of such a large company knows how better to deal with customer? Absolutely appalling customer service from the onboard train staff.",

When we tried next day it was still bad, but staff at the Kings Cross station was very helpful despite the pressure they were under. We had a ticket with a different train company however LNER staff let us on their train with no problem and wished us to get home safely. We later changed to the northern rail to get further to our destination and that was the opposite of good service. Compassion and kindness goes long way during such stressful times, helping people to get home will earn loyalty. I would be happy to always choose LNER when I travel.",

They've kept over \u00a3200 of my money, which I can't get back OR transfer to a future journey AND there will be 4 'booked' empty seats on a return journey that is usually standing-room only (which, let's face it, they'll probably resell so that they make double bubble).\n\nDisgusting policy, but they get away with it because there's no other viable option on the East Coast Mainline.

        "review_text": "Not great experiences. Been on the LNER services twice, both times from London to Sheffield. Both times the staff apologised that the train was only 5 carriages, not 9 as it was supposed to be. The last time we had seats, but there was massive confusion regarding bookings not being honoured, and my wife lost her seat to someone who said they had booked it, then refused to move out again when it was announced the bookings had been cancelled. The train manager said she\u2019s spoken to the manager of the next train, who had seats and we could swap trains. My wife, daughter and I headed for the exit, but were told it was too late to leave the train, so all had to stand in the doorway all the way to Sheffield, with other passengers crammed in. Zero for two with our experiences with LNER. We have one more trip back to London late next week - not confident it won\u2019t be another disaster, and not looking forward to it.",

This company should think about the well-being of passengers as well not just the profit they can make by selling tickets for an already fully booked train or at least warn them that there are  no seats available and offer tickets at a lower price as a 'stand by'before payment.\nEven though I requested a seat number as seat reservation is mandatory I didn't get one, I got' a counted place'. It wasn't even a last minute booking. \nUnbelievable! Please don't sell tickets if you cannot offer a seat. Think about the passengers!",

Cancelling travel arrangements screws up peoples plans and costs them, LNER need to accept this. Speaking to a friend about this and they told me the same happened to them approx 2 weeks earlier on the same train (10:30 from Durham to Kings X). This is obviously a known issue with LNER but they choose to still sell tickets and treat customers like cattle. However, LNER still managed to hike the price of first class tickets up to just under the 2k mark for the same journey - disgusting.\nEnded up driving down and will never even consider using LNER again.

I made a four hour journey from Bristol (on a strike day) and waited 40mins only to be told my suitcase was sent to \u2018Newark\u2019s north gate depot\u2019. I was given a number to contact them that never worked, I was passed around from one customer personnel to another,only to be told 2 weeks later that my suitcase has been lost!!! When I tried to further enquire, they couldn\u2019t give me any information about how the suitcase was lost? They couldn\u2019t even let me speak to their manager!! I was just told the situation is being \u201cescalated\u201d haven\u2019t received any updates and it\u2019s been 10 days since. \nI am absolutely devastated as I\u2019m only a healthcare medical student, I had my stethoscope, my laptop in there, and my placement portfolio.",

As I waited for the staff to offer food and drinks, the person skipped over me and offered the last bap to the person after me that boarded at the same time.  I then had to walk after them to find out if I could at least get a coffee or tea, they said they didn't have any hot water on the train, and were saving the remaining food \"for those that need it\".  As the person after me was older, I'm assuming they are only offering food to the older travellers.\n\nI've put forward a formal complaint and asked for the upgrade refund on the 12 July, the day I travelled, and just received a response today, 11 August, from Maddison V.:\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is a complimentary service and is not included within the price of the ticket.\"\n\nBiggest waste of money, terrible services, staff clearly discriminate as there is no other reason they skipped over me as if I was just an empty seat.",

Really frustrating considering the amount of money I have spent on this train company over the last 2 years only to be met with poor customer service and numerous train cancellations & delays.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter being directed to their contact line by their social team, I have to give CS agent Kieran credit as he managed to sort this issue out immediately. Very grateful he resolved this unnecessarily drawn-out problem so quickly and professionally! Wish I could just give him 5 stars. Thank you!",

Delay due to an incident had been issued almost immediately. Nothing we or LNER can do about it, so we patiently waited until further notice. We were given many updates and people of other trains were stuffed into the 13.30 service. After 4+ (!!!!!) hours of waiting, the service to Kings Cross was still cancelled, another train after us which was more empty was allowed to leave and we were moved to the next train which would be the last one to Kings Cross. This one was completely full (people, even elderly standing). Employees were anything but helpful. All saying we had to go to another person. When we said to one of the employees \u201cyou (LNER the company, not the employee herself) are making people crazy\u201d (due to the constant unclarity of their statements), her very not helpful nor customer friendly reaction was \u201cyou people are making ME crazy\u201d. After that I was yelled at to go into the available train which other LNER employees told us were full and we couldn\u2019t go in. \n\nCompletely understand that an incident is out of your control but the way customers were handled here was appalling.",

The meals included in the ticket are delightful, and access to the first-class lounge at Kings Cross is a significant perk, offering a warm place to relax and complimentary beverages. However, there's room for improvement in comfort; the seats could be more comfortable, and the headrests are quite hard. Notably, other train operators using similar train models have softer headrests. Therefore, I suggest LNER consider upgrading to softer headrests for enhanced passenger comfort.",

Also if I wanted a gin and tonic - there might be a problem as they were running out of cans of tonic. There was no wifi. The seating was spacious. \nBut take a tip - never book first class with LNER - it is not good value for money and you end up starving at your place of arrival. I recommend saving a lot of money booking standard class - and getting our own food at the station retail shops before boarding - you sure wont get any on the train.

        "review_text": "In the first half of last year I travelled with LNER a few times and one of those times my train was delayed a lot, meaning I was entitled to Delay Repay. I submitted the claim within 28 days and waited. After two months of nothing, I called LNER and the approx 25 minutes including hold time conversation with their CS team went something like this:\n\nMe - \"Hi, I want to check a Delay Repay claim, the reference is LNER-23xxxx-ABCD, I haven't been paid yet\"\nCS - \"Yes, I've found that, let's have a look\"\nMe - \"Can you tell me why it's not been paid?\nCS - \"I can't see anything on the system, but I'll get that sorted out for you... you can expect payment in 10 working days\"\n\nIn the latter half of last year, I was able to rack up another three Delay Repay claims, all submitted according to their requirements. Did I get an email/letter saying that they were unable to pay my claim? No. Did they pay my claim? Also no. So I will have to call them again and waste even more of my time that I will never get back in order to chivvy them into action. \n\nAs my family have reported similar with their Delay Repay claims and I have read dozens of reviews here with essentially the same comments, it seems that LNER have discovered that if they just sit on Delay Repay claims without paying them unless the customer calls in and asks where their money is, they will have a non-zero number of passengers give up their claim because due to life happening they are just too busy to follow it up. As a result, LNER will actually have to pay out less money than they would if they just paid each valid claim automatically as I have found other companies do.\n\nI know LNER CS read these reviews and will probably insist that is not the case, but if that were so, why have I got 4 of 4 Delay Repay claims not paid, eh? I'm sure the Ombudsman would be interested to find out why...

Booked first class to make it less stressful. A week or two before travel got emails about change of departure time so that we would arrive at the same time but depart 90 minutes later - thought great! On the day of travel, checked the LNER app and learned everything was set, no further changes, yet we couldn't find the train on the departure boards. Approached a ticket office, and were told with no hint or apology that the train we were moved onto never existed. She even implied that we were the problem, or had made a mistake. I can see why she wears a badge asking people not to abuse her. We were told to try to get on one later and see if the guard would let us. With a 2 year old to get to bed, the proposed arrival time was far later than we had planned. Even right until the departure time, the LNER app told us there was no problem. I find it unbelieveable that in 2023 LNER can book us onto a train that never existed, fail to tell us, fail to apologise when asked, or to make any commitment about getting us to our destination on another train. Once we were on the train, the manager said that the seat reservations system was not in operation but that people should try to stick to their booked seat, leading to very tense scenes and arguments between others. Paying us a 100% refund is not a fair solution, a 2, 3 or 400% refund would be more appropriate in this situation.",

We transferred to another train at our first stop and were told that because our train didn\u2019t go to London they didn\u2019t restock with food and that they would restock in Newcastle. No food for now. They restocked a little later but ran out of the sandwiches two cabins before they got to us. 6 hours and no food except crisps and biscuits. They did leave a menu on our table though, which just added insult to injury. No full menu available as advertised and nothing but sandwiches to start with and we didn\u2019t event get that. The attendants basically told us that they ran out of food and all they could do was say sorry. I asked if we were going to \u201crestock\u201d again for the rest of the train and they said we were not. I guess we\u2019re just supposed to not eat a real meal for 6 hours. Very poor service. It was also very hot on the train. I won\u2019t make the mistake of giving Lner my money again. Lesson learned. Unless you love being frustrated and hungry, stay away from Lner!",

        "review_text": "Family of three (two adults plus a 7-year-old), today (Sunday 26/11/23) at the 20:05 train to Wakefield from Kings Cross we had the most disgusting experience one can ever imagine. We were originally had booked the 19:35 train to Wakefield from London Kings Cross. Both the notice board and the app said there was a delay so the train would leave at 19:47 instead. We went there a few minutes before 19:47 when the operator told us that the train left on time! He asked us to go to the ticket office to be issued new tickets for the 20:05 train which went relatively smoothly. The 20:05 train as one can imagine was quite full, because there were quite a few people like ourselves. We took seats at the first class because that was the only place we could find where we could sit all together as a family. The ticket man came shortly after, insisting categorically that we have to move and claiming that there are seats further to the front. I told him I would go check and come back. I did. There were only a few scattered single seats. It would have been impossible for us to sit next to our 7-year-old if we went there. The ticket man insisted we have to move no matter what I said; all reasonable things. It was the most disgusting, numb and inhuman thing I\u2019ve been told. Not only it was a complete health and safety issue walking down the many carriages with my little one and all our stuff, with people sitting on the floor, with stuff all over the place blocking doors and passages, but we would also end up seating separately, which is unacceptable. An error which was completely theirs (notice board and app providing false information), cost us the safety of our journey and our sanity. LNER and specifically the ticket man on the 20:05 exhibited a horrible, unprofessional, numb, disgusting, indifferent, and inhumane behaviour. They need to train their stuff to handle such situations properly. Would they assume responsibility, if I had fallen down, trying to literally climb above people, luggage, and other sorts of obstacles to go get a seat on the front carriages just so that they can keep the first class seats empty for NO REASON?!?!?",

        "review_text": "We recently travelled from London to Lincoln on one of LNER's new 'Azuma' trains.  First, the good news: the train departed on time and actually arrived early.  The train crew were polite and friendly, and unlike on many other trains there was ample room for our luggage.  On the whole, the 'Azuma' seems to be a decent enough train, if not up to the standards of equivalent European trains, but then it is a long time since the UK was a world leader in rail transport.   \n\nHowever, what spoilt the journey for me were the hideously uncomfortable seats.  Granted, they do have more legroom than on some previous trains, but the whole experience was like sitting on a solid ironing board for 2 hours.  The journey was very uncomfortable, and despite being fairly fit for my age I had difficulty getting out of my seat on arrival at Lincoln, and I had cramp for a long time afterwards.  When I contacted LNER about this, they said that great care had been taken to design the seats as ergonomically as possible!  If this is the case, why do the First Class seats look so much more comfortable?\n\nI would add that we had just returned from a European trip, during which we had travelled on a wide variety of trains.  On none of these did I experience any discomfort at all, even though some of the journeys were longer than the 2 hour LNER trip.",

Courteous staff and comfortable window seating, with train arriving a few minutes early in Edinburgh; but delayed by 51 minutes on the return due to trespassers on the line north of York - kept fully informed on the PA system (that's all you want, including being advised all trains at a stand).\nAnd the next morning when I logged on to my computer, there was an email from LNER advising that due to late arrival we were due \u00a3101.80 compensation, which required one click - already now received.\nBeats the hassle of airports/flying and the \u00a340 compensation received following a tortuous application to a well known travel insurance company after our plane was forced to land in Bode, because a blizzard in Tromso prevented landing at our destination, resulting in an overnight delay and the loss of nearly a day in our 3 night holiday!\nThank you LNER - brilliant service and journeys.",

I have done this for several years now and my experiences on LNER trains have always been good with nothing to complain about. Other operators I typically have to deal with overcrowded carriages, toilet issues and various other problems which I have not experienced on a LNER train.\n\nI find it's usually when you have a problem and speak to customer service that the true nature of a company is revealed and where most train operators can be incredibly harsh and even in extenuating circumstances it can be troublesome to rectify the situation, I had an incredibly unfortunate event occur which meant I was unable to travel last year. I did not have a refundable ticket and was not entitled to a refund, however LNER upon hearing of the situation were happy on this occasion to show compassion in an unprecedented situation. I think this speaks volumes as to the type of company this is. I would not hesitate to recommend LNER and will be prioritising them in future even if it means going a bit out of my way!",

The next grand central service was the 4.48 which would mean I miss my connection from Doncaster to Newcastle with LNER. (Left at 6.12 & the 4.48 grand central would get into Doncaster at 6.22).  I spoke to a member of LNER staff in the station and was told to get on the 4.30pm train which I would be joining in Doncaster anyway. \n\nTwo staff members (Kay)Revenue protection officer  and Paulo Train manager insisted that the information I had been given from the member of staff at Kings Cross. (I didn\u2019t get their name, I was rushing for my train straight from work with two heavy cases) was different to the information they were given. They showed me emails they received from LNER - which I had never been privy to. I have been charged \u00a385.80 for a ticket from Kings Cross to Doncaster which in itself is daylight robbery. I use the train every two weeks to travel up north and the instances of cancellations, delays and strike action over the last two years are ridiculous. \n\nIf I\u2019ve gone from the information the member of staff has told me in King\u2019s Cross to get on the 4.30 train. How can I be charged 85\u00a3 for getting on THE only train that allows me to make my connection.  You have the following clause in your T&C \u201cHowever, if cancelled or delayed trains cause you to miss a connection, you are advised to ask a member of staff; in exceptional circumstances staff may endorse your ticket for travel on alternative routes\u201d. How have I been charged so much with absolutely no consideration and empathy from LNER train staff? \n\nI would like a refund for the ticket they made me buy.

        "review_text": "Do not purchase a ticket through LNER. They have the most appalling refund policy I have ever encountered.  While riding the service is fine, I would  strongly recommend booking through Trainline or another competitor in case  the ticket is cancelled or you need to change the ticket. They also charge \u00a310, but at least the process is easy, uncomplicated, and they pay you the correct sum.\n\nI purchased a \u00a3154.70 return from south east England to Scotland through the LNER app as I was offered a little discount and I thought I would try them. I was forced to change the date and time, which they say is fine, for a \u00a310 fee and as long as you purchase a new ticket first. \n\nEven though neither set had been issued they demanded that I collect both sets of tickets, take photos of them, find booking codes for both tickets hidden amongst the emails that they had sent (that were not on the tickets themselves as one would imagine) and submit these in an online form. They then rejected the refund because the tickets on the older set of tickets had not been cut in half. All of this is information that they had generated and was designed to make it very difficult to claim the money they owed me.\n\nOn the third attempt I finally got a refund, but not for \u00a3144.70, as I should have received, but for \u00a3140.02. Apparently the extra \u00a34.68 was an undisclosed and unagreed admin fee on top of the advertised \u00a310 admin fee that they were already charging. The issue is pending with the Rail Ombudsman as I feel that, on principle, this is unacceptable behaviour.\n\nI complained to the Rail Ombudsman about the \"sludging\" that they are evidently performing to try to acquire their customers money. Particularly as vulnerable customers will certainly not be able to navigate the paperwork minefield they create and will lose out. They were of no use at all and told me that this behaviour is out of scope.\n\nI will never purchase a ticket through LNER again. Hopefully this will help you avoid the awful hassle that I have had.",

        "review_text": "This was our first trip coming up from London to Harrogate together by train (given the missus prefers the discretionary travel by car) and we were immediately plagued with issues...\n\nPoorly distributed services on tube lines (tube services not going through to King's Cross on scheduled times). Passengers blocking the closing doors. Guaranteed hot and humid weather.\n\nSo unsurprisingly, we missed our original train.\n\nOf course we had flexible tickets, but how could I possibly convince the missus that trains were the ideal mode of transport? We had plans, that we'd now be late for, and I didn't want her driving home from North Yorkshire in the late evenings in future...\n\nSo we get on the next train heading in the same direction - exhausted and deceived. \n\nUp until the Train Manager, a slender man called Steve, asked us for our tickets. A pleasant smile, a thorough inspection of tickets, and wished us a pleasant journey - A true embodiment of great customer service.\n\nThough shortly into our journey, we realised we packed the wrong food (surplus fajita filling, as opposed the fajitas themselves), and roared into laughter amidst the inconvenience.\n\nBut Steve picked up the bizzare laughter, and asked if everything seemed alright, and to no issue, we explained the circumstance...\n\n...only for him to gladly come back with a basket of G&Ts and gluten-free brownies, stating they did have some wraps for fajitas if we wanted them. \"Mistakes happen, and it's such an original story - I couldn't let you go hungry\"\n\nWe smiled ear to ear knowing such a selfless and caring man, let alone one in the world of customer service, existed. It undoubtedly takes a special person to go out of their way to ensure that two random passengers in standard class have pleasant and enjoyable journey.\n\nI've travelled on UK trains, throughout the country, for nearly a decade, getting a train on average once every two months. \n\nAnd this man, surpassed any experience. It's now safe to say, we'll be getting a train from London in future, especially a LNER. Let's just hope Steve's on the train too.\n\nWhat a kind man.\n\n(@LNER, the train was on 9th September LNER 12:35 KGX - LDS: commend this gentleman!)",

His demeanor was courteous and patient, and he actively listened to my concerns without rushing or interrupting me. This alone was a refreshing change from previous encounters I had with customer service representatives from various companies.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that hey are still trying to resolve the issue efficiently but because of professionals like Brian that I now have a renewed faith in LNER's commitment to customer satisfaction.",

        "title": "Disappointing customer service to support journey termination",
        "review_text": "On Friday 1st December my train from London Kings Cross to Selby was severely delayed. Unfortunately, due to wires on the track we were stuck between Newark and Doncaster for approximately 3 hours. My 1 star review is not due to the delay, as the staff on the train did the best they could and ultimately the situation was outside of their control. \n\nThe nature of my complaint is the terrible customer service we received when the train had to terminate at Doncaster. We were advised approximately two hours into the delay that our train would be terminated and that onward transport (bus or taxi) would be arranged to take us to our destinations. \n\nWhen we arrived at approximately 11:30pm there were no taxis or onward transport that had been organised. There was no process in which individuals were grouped into destinations or advised to wait inside until transport was sourced, instead, all passengers (including elderly and young children) were made to wait outside. There was no process in which people could get into a taxi and passengers were left to find out with each other which stations they needed to get to. Furthermore, the taxi firm that was allocated the onward transport disregarded passengers for Selby, with 6 taxis in a row taking passengers to Hull or Brough. At this time the outside temperature was -3. \nAt 12.45am we still had not been allocated transport (after waiting outside in the sub-zero temperatures), despite raising to the taxi team, who then advised myself and three other passengers that they were being stood down. This left us without any transport and unable to book transport privately (myself and another passenger were contacting local companies and Uber, but were not getting these confirmed or were on other jobs).\nWe then proceeded to go to Platform 4, as were advised that some LNER staff were still there. I did not catch the name of the woman (blonde hair, approx. 35-45 years old) but she was not interested in our concerns and stated, out loud, that if any passenger came to 'kick off' that she would shut the door and remain in her office. She did ring a taxi, but could not confirm that this would definitely take us to Selby or let us know when it had arrived so we did not have to wait in the cold. This woman and her colleague remained in their office and did not return, to advise when any taxis had arrived or to check on the remaining passengers. \n\nWe returned to the taxi pick-up point and, after some time (it was 1:50am at this point) a taxi turned up. When asked if they would take to Selby they initially refused until one of the passengers said that would pay double the fair and in cash. I did not get to Selby train station until 02:30am. \n\nI hope that LNER use this experience as a scenario for training, to ensure that all their customer facing staff are appropriately trained in these situations and have the initiative to ensure ongoing transport is organised effectively and efficiently, making sure that all passengers are safe at the very least.",

        "review_text": "I had to take an LNER service from Edinburgh to London instead of my original avanti west coast Glasgow to Euston. The train was packed, only one available seat on first class which I was charged \u00a3243 (despite having upgraded originally, my ticket was therefore not honoured. I had tried to buy the ticket on trainline for \u00a3116 but your wifi didnt work, tried to explain this to the ticket inspector who was extremely aggressive explaining that \u00a3116 was for an advanced ticket - I tried explaining that I knew that and I was trying to buy the ticket before the train departed, I was sat on the train for 10 minutes before the official departure time and the ticket was certainly available to buy, its just the wifi was so slow that I decided to just buy it through him directly,  but he didnt seem to understand and kept aggressively explaining how it was impossible to buy a ticket for this train because the train was moving... (as for why I hadnt bought a ticket earlier that is because I had been told my avanti west coat ticket would be honoured) I also didn't expect the train would have no available seats in standard class. My phone battery was also very low until I was able to charge it on the train - due to my original 930am train being cancelled and waiting until 14:30 to get a new train. \n\nDespite the seat being labelled available I had to move at the next stop as someone had booked after all. Please refund. My options where pay \u00a3243 or stand for 5 hours, and after already running around trying to catch trains that were cancelled by avanti all morning I just needed to sit down. The staff were no help and seemed really rude and uninterested. In the past when a train is unexpectedly full the rules on sitting in first class are relaxed, I didn't get any of the first class service but still paid \u00a3243, my original journey to London with avanti cost \u00a323, and \u00a3243 is more than double the \u00a3116 if bought on trainline, which seems an insane price to charge - and for what exactly? The privilege of having a seat for a 5 hour journey and a tiny portion of food it seems.",

An announcement stated that the train was cancelled as they were unable to find a train driver. \n5) Got another train from Newcastle to get to Kings Cross, however this was packed with all the people from the cancelled train as well as the people already on the train - Stood in the hallway for over 5 hours, then got cramped as more people got on from York. Ended up sitting on the floor.\n\nUnderstandable that things happen thats out of anyones control. Sent an email to customer service and spoke to someone on Twitter. LNER representative on twitter gave my a link for delays and I received a refund of 50% for both tickets. Received an email back from the customer service team and Jai Lynch sent a very personalised email apologising, they saw that I had already received a partial refund but they decided to give me the rest of my money back.\nCan't thank them enough for listening and caring.  \nI hope my review gets seen by Jai Lynch and they receive some recognition the company for being a GREAT customer service rep!",

        "review_text": "Appreciate the prompt response. I know I can claim compensation. if you check my record you will see that my train journeys are delayed/cancelled over 60 per cent of the time. how LNER remains financially viable defeats me based on the amount of compensation it has to pay out but it\u2019s not a private enterprise so suppose it\u2019s funded by the taxpayer. only once was a cancellation due to industrial action. I can accept the following - trespassers on the line, adverse weather, lines down, train blocking track, smashed windscreen, no driver which left me stranded at Spalding for 1.5 hours before I could return to Lincoln on my original outgoing train!!, carriage door not closing making train unsafe, no manager, no driver ( presumably due to short notice absence??) what I find difficult to accept is being advised no train crew with only 30 minutes notice - no mention of disruption on the screen - what disruption occurred on 27th May? it was supposed to be a normal day as the strike action was scheduled for 2nd, 3rd June?? surely LNER knew well in advance if they have sufficient staff on duty in the right locations. I note that the Leeds train was also cancelled for the same reason at the same time. my concern is that LNER continues to sell tickets for journeys they are unable to provide. the knock on effect is that people, such as myself, incur non refundable expenses for hotels, theatre tickets, etc. i book in advance to obtain affordable tickets - average refund for me is about \u00a327 for cancelled journey. I have actually forfeited about \u00a3450 in bookings for hotels/theatres over the last year due to LNER not delivering a service. needless to say I no longer book theatre matinees and pay additional fee in case I have to cancel accommodation due to LNER not transporting me to London or anywhere else to offset enforced cancelled hotel expenses.  this is nothing to do with strike action as I know not to book on those dates. the staff I meet are usually excellent but the reliability of LNER is an embarrassment and passengers are treated with contempt. I get a text saying your train is cancelled so you need to find an alternative journey. it\u2019s become the norm. that\u2019s totally unacceptable. why do we put up with it?? i don\u2019t want compensation - nothing compensates for being left stranded or having to squeeze into an overcrowded train and arriving home hours late.  i won\u2019t be booking anymore journeys in the near future - it\u2019s too stressful. \n\nwell.LNER. what can I say. I travel regularly but it\u2019s fingers crossed. latest was Saturday 27th. 19.06 cancelled with 30 minutes notice - no train crew???. why would I EVER book LNER again. good news is they refund promptly. I just want to book a train that actually travels. how can they not have enough train crew?? am i confident in LNER? well. I have lost so much money due to onward expenses - non refundable theatre/hotel tickets. train refund doesn\u2019t even cover it. LNER rubbish but when you live in Lincoln not much choice. I managed to get home but 1 hour 30 minutes late and a change at Peterborough instead of direct - terrible service. I\u2019m getting far too old for all this hassle.  not sure I want to book anymore journeys.",

Some people never made it to their seat. \nThis happened because they had cancelled an earlier train and they literally \"stuffed\" the passengers in one train, so they would not spend money on another.\nI believe this was against all health and safety regulations, that is it illegal and deserves investigation. \nFor a very long journey from Nottingham to Edimburgh people never had the chance to go to toilet, have a drink or get to their luggage. If any emergency had occured in this train, nobody would be able to deal with it and people or pets would have died.\nThis is unacceptable, discriminative humiliating and intimidating for every passenger, because we do not travel for free, we pay an extreme price for train tickets , so we deserve a lot more dignity than they allow us.\nVery disappointed. And this is not the first time. It is a disgrace for England, for English culture and perhaps for lner as well. But, maybe not for them, as they might not bother as profit is above all, right??",

Maybe the LNER plan is to offer First Class to everyone; just it\u2019s not First Class and as such should not be referenced as this. I\u2019ve witnessed the demise of First Class over the past 3 decades; it\u2019s no longer first class at all. It has now become upper standard class. No proper breakfast or dinner service. No silver service premium service. No menu of any worth for either time of the day either; it\u2019s a shambles but the staff do their best. This service used to offer real first class rail travel (1990\u2019s), unrivalled in Europe. Now, it\u2019s a 125mph tuck shop and an utterly dreadful low class of experience.",

They were wonderful and showed great inpersonable skills as they wisked away some of our suit cases and took care of everything from the platform to the train. \n\nThe experience could have been quite different for our Mum as she was reluctant to travel home,given she is in recovery, and is currently in a wheelchair. \n\nThe assistance on the train was just as exceptional with special thanks being extended to Farouk,the train Manager, on the 10.55 to London, who showed kindness and an excellent customer care approach. \n\nThank you LNER,you have made our day! \n\nWith gratitude, The Hurley - Chambers Family London",

I was then rudely accosted and treated like a criminal by your guard \u201cCraig 1D22\u201d, who wouldn\u2019t even let me speak or explain why I was on the wrong train, just spoke over me and threatened me with legal action and fines. I showed him my hospital discharge letter and he just kept threatening me, saying \u201care you going to pay then\u201d loudly over and over in my face. I burst into tears and just paid to get rid of him as he was starting to scare me. I\u2019ve never been treated like this before and I\u2019ve spent the whole journey home crying, I\u2019m so so disgusted by how I\u2019ve been treated.\n\nI want my \u00a367 refunding immediately, I had already paid for the journey so I don\u2019t see how sitting on an empty seat 2 hours earlier is affecting your services or costing you money, it\u2019s absolutely appalling to have charged me to do it, especially when I\u2019m only travelling home early after spending the night in hospital.",

Train on time - bonus, boarded train and sat down on a very uncomfortable standard class seat with extremely light padding and poor ergonomics. Phone needed a charge and had to scramble under the seat to find the plug sockets, very strange design. Narrow carriage so no room for trolley service, delivery to your seat unavailable and I couldn't be bothered to go to the buffet car as the train was swaying from side to side every time it went over points or negotiated a camber in the track.\nThe design limitations resulting in the rough ride is a real and very annoying design flaw, as if you need the toilet and happen to flush it as it's going around a camber in the track, the jet of water spurts out of the toilet bowl and ends up all over the floor. Dangerous, unhygienic and unacceptable.\nThe staff on the train were friendly and the trip back was a little better as the table service was available, but at the not unsubstantial ticket price of \u00a3291 for a standard class day return, for spending 4 hours on an uncomfortable train I feel these trains are a step back from the much more comfortable class 90 225's.

I remember once a male staff member on a train from Newcastle to Edinburgh was so empathetic and helpful with me when I was distressed and I remember it to this day. Unfortunately they recently made some changes regarding claiming back credit if you didn't get your train. I used to find this super helpful because I travel a lot with LNER for work and work plans change a lot, so if I didn't get on a train as plans have changed I could claim it back in credit. They no longer do this anymore for advance (specific time) tickets. I'm not annoyed they implemented this change as I can adapt, I'm annoyed they didn't communicate the changes clearly e.g. an email which means I have wasted money on a train I couldn't catch and because I didn't know about the changes, I didn't think to change the date or time of the train as I thought I'd get the credit back.",

York has 20 minutes worth of delays going in!!!\n\nSo we're all crammed into this doorway while ticket inspectors are barging through the aisle and others are trying to get through and use the loo. And you announce that *soon* we'll be in York??? We spent 20 minutes jammed inside of a doorway until finally being told we are delayed. Couldve said it while we were all seated!

        "review_text": "My wife and I booked first class return tickets with LNER from London to Leeds. Outgoing 16/02/23 and returning 19/02/23. Going was fine. Coming back we were issued with 3 separate tickets changing twice to get to Sheffield. The LNER employee at Leeds station was amazed that we had to do this as there are direct and fast trains from Leeds to Sheffield. Needless to say neither of these connecting trains had first class coaches. We are not in the first flush of youth and heaving cases on and off trains is not a happy memory. When we got to Sheffield we finally got on a train with a first class carriage and found our seats. Train departed and within five minutes there was an announcement saying there would be no food or drinks available as there was no HOST to serve us. Then we were informed that we could make our own way to the static trolley where on production of our first class tickets we could get some limited refreshments. My wife did this and came back saying the rest of the train was absolutely rammed with people and the trolley was not open and she was not attempting that experience again. So we paid for a first class experience on one train and we got 3 trains, no first class on two of them and no refreshments as promised and we had no food or drinks with us. Does not really match the way this service is advertised online. At no time were we told why we could not travel from Leeds to London directly or that we would not have any food or drinks despite the company having our details which they regularly use to tell me all about their great deals. Over a week ago I sent a complaint to LNER. about this shoddy service and to date there has been no acknowledgement or reply which is pretty poor customer service. When you pay for a service you expect, not unreasonably, to get it.",

The only thing I would change is the lack of 2 seat options without people sitting opposite you at a table. The entire 1st class only has two pairs of 2 seats together that arn\u2019t at a table of 4. On the return jouney those 4 seats face backwards which is a no for us, so we had to have a 4 seater table with strangers opposite us which took away the private feeling.",

        "review_text": "My wife emailed LNER on 10/2/23 regarding a problem we'd had on a return journey from London the day before, part of which was asking why the app refused to let us look for tickets when there was still 20 minutes left before departure. After hearing nothing for 9 days she sent them a message via Twitter at around 18:30 on 23/2/23. She was connected to someone who seemed to have his attention elsewhere as his responses to her questions were taking an age;at one point my wife waited 8 minutes, and on asking if she was still connected still got no response. Eventually when they did reply it was to: \"I work alongside our Customer Relations team, I can confirm that no refund would be due\". So they don't work on that team, but know what their answer will be? My wife asked to speak to Customer Relations, at which point the person became very obstructive. After repeating the request several times he stated he would pass a message on to them.\n\nAround 5 minutes later the phone rang and a chap introduced himself as being from Customer Relations. My wife asked, though, if he could speak to me, but was ignored and they continued speaking, saying that they agreed with the first person she's spoken with, and their policy was there would be no refund. Like that first person, this chap would not answer, either, why we could not book tickets before the train departed. My wife tried to explain what had occurred, only for the chap to go quiet, say nothing to acknowledge he was listening, and then, when she had finished, just repeated there would be no refund, as was their policy.\nFeeling the Customer Relations chap didn't really want to help, my wife asked to speak to his manager and was told they would contact her within 24 hours. That was 3 days, and nothing.\n\nIf this is what LNER considers customer service, then I despair. But if they would actually like to prove they do want to help and contact us as promised, then we're still waiting...\n\nUPDATE: further to the reply from LNER we received an email from the Customer Service Team that was nothing more than a copy and paste of the response from the Twitter reply. So we sent a response back, giving more details about what had happened and asked that they just look at the details rather than making a decision without all the facts. That was 2 weeks and 2 days ago and we have heard nothing. So clearly the initial response from LNER was typical - they just ignore you and have no interest at all in talking and showing a modicum of interest in what occurred.",

I hate that the customer service morons on the trains are just as thick as they are useless and on the Leeds services there is always problems with broken coffee machines and dysfunctional toilets. Every single class 800 and 801 on the London Kings X too Leeds services is always diabolical. The hiygene is poor. The toilets always smell of poo and the trains are never cleaned. The social media teams of all train operating companies in the UK are useless. The staff are rude. The trains are dirty. The catering is filthy dirty unwashed cups and crockery. The cleaning teams at Leeds station are lazy and I have walked onto several trains with filthy chairs covered in crumbs. The prices are expensive and whilst the East Coast Maineline staff have always had rods shoved up their butts since they dug into middle earth the good thing about predecessor East Coast Trains were the prices were appropriate and the points system unlike NECTAR which is touche was an awesome scheme save East Coast rewards was a decent price and allowed ECML managers NOT too put their head up their butts and con the disgruntled passengers out of money and the staff at Kings Cross are just so useless they are rude and unlike TFL do NOT help with queries and avaid maturity LNER are so expensive and the vegetarian and vegan food is always crap I have left several complaints about broken trolleys and dysfunctional toilets over the years but NOTHING is accepted by LNER LNER babble on into Eternity about manners but they are clearly NOT too be desired for customer service and information. It mames me extremely angry that LNER know nothing about their own fleet of trains they do NOT know when the class 91s are leaving ECML permanently dates and years or any MK4S. LNER are the rudest train operating company I have ever come accross and they are now worse than GNER who were owned by the sea containers from 1996 too 2007 in fact everything is so inconssisstant with LNER and what infuriates me is that the class 800s and 801s are diabolical they simply just dont work properly the trains are so unreliable and whilst I prefer the fabric seats too the horrible leather ones onboard the class 91's I prefer the reliability of the class 91 too the overrated class 800's the class 800's are physically weak they have got NO push pull power like their x class 43s did the trains are always having cracks and run more as a british train than English train despite having Japaneass technology although I am yet too learn the benefits of the class 800 family as they break into pieces extremely easily during crashes and emergencies and the buffet carriages and trolley at seat service is always broken meaning NO hot water and hot food and the class 800s do NOT have ebough space for luggage and capacity in fact the trains safety is a liability because I felt much safer on a crappy run down GNER valenta class 43 but one advantage GNER have over LNER is the law and order of the train operating company authority GNER were at least some what aware of what was going on where LNER even the most simple questions know nothing about their own company and the LNER representatives are a disgrace the onboard toilets on the extremely extremely MODERN CLASS 800 SERVICES are always blocked and covered in FAECES AND WASTE do LNER NOT have health and safety checks because their trains could really do with being drowned in ACIDIC VINEGAR for hours and the water and soap dispensers are terrible there is always food on chairs and the cleaning regimes are NOT long enough and lack of cleaning staff especially at barrbarrick Leeds station and the class 800s are replacing class 91s but out of the two class 91s are more reliable than 800s and the class 800s are alwaus having to stop in tje middle of nowhere its extrememy irritating.",

Having heard my train called I tried to get through the crowd with my learning disabled adult son and 5 year old gran daughter, thankfully after 15 minutes and a lot of kind strangers (and some awful ones) the LNER staff member allowed us through. He informed us there was no room on my booked train, another staff member reiterated this both were pleasant and patient who knows how it must have been horrible for them too. LNER must get information to their customers who can make better choices, given the age of my granddaughter and my son I would have booked a room in a travel lodge and gone home on Saturday.",

        "review_text": "I travelled with LNER from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh and back in January. Both trains left on time and were not too busy. The seats were comfortable and had a good amount of leg room. During the return journey we ran into an issue with the track which delayed our arrival by 35 minutes but the delay repay was really easy - I received an email immediately after the journey which gave me a link to get a 50% refund. Overall I was very happy with the trip and would travel with LNER again. My only gripe was that the return train was quite hot.",

        "review_text": "LNER don't answer email complaints. Below was sent on 17th January.\n\nHello,\n\nI'm writing to complain about the awful experience I had in December with LNER.\n\nFollowing a previous complaint, I was given first class COMP tickets by yourselves as compensation.\n\nI booked a train from London to Darlington on 24th Dec, which was later cancelled. I rebooked for 23rd December and arrived at 4pm to ensure I had plenty of time. At around 5pm I found out that this second train was cancelled also. The following two trains were also cancelled, so I had to wait for three hours until another train became available.\n\nOnce i managed to get on this train, it was delayed as there was no train manager available. When we eventually set off it was so crowded I had to step over people to get to the toilet, as they were sitting on all the available floor space between the carriages.\n\nI foolishly assumed that as I was travelling first class, food and drink would be provided. There was absolutely no catering service on the train (apart from one of your staff throwing a case of bottled water onto the carriage at a stop on the way up) As we headed into Darlington one of your staff offered me a cold sandwich, which was too little, and too late as I prepared to get off.\n\nIf you were hoping to create a good impression by giving me these COMP tickets, it had the absolute opposite effect. It was one of the most stressful journeys I've ever had to endure. Even the 'first class' service on the way back on the 27th was poor.\n\nOne of the worst train journeys I've ever experienced...\n\nMartin",

For some reason they don\u2019t email you the tickets ;) they want you to have the physical tickets so mistakes are made easier and they can charge you extra. My printed tickets didn\u2019t include my return journey, asked the officer to reprint them and he refused, I got on the train anyway (why shouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019ve paid!) and told the officer that I would get on the train, who in turn asked the train manager to do a ticket check and charge me instead. The train manager talked to me as if I was trying to get on the train without paying for it, without entertaining the possibility that a mistake might have been made on their system, extremely rude without cause, I just obliged and paid for the extra fee anyway, despite the unnecessary rudeness. \n\nTo top that, they asked us to move from our coach to another coach due to some problem I didn\u2019t understand and not many on the same coach did - their communications are not good. \n\nHad a couple of calls with the customer service. One of the good employees actually listened to me and helped me out. The rest, including the rude train manager, showed a consistent pattern of talking down to customers and exploiting them.",

Our train from Peterborough to Kings Cross was delayed which I understand sometimes these things can't be helped but because another train was cancelled, it meant our train was packed and people had used our reserved seats. They refused to move when I asked and we were unable to locate any staff as we couldn't move through the carriages to check due to the number of people on the train. I was travelling with my elderly mother in law and aunt, as well as my disabled cousin, who all had to stand for the entire 50 minute journey. My 3 children ended up sat on the floor next to the toilet! I wasn't happy but assumed I would be able to claim on LNER's seat guarantee scheme, only to receive a response to say they wouldn't refund us as we were able to find alternative reserved seats (which I had already explained to them we weren't able to). Again, I understand some things are beyond LNER's control, such as the people that wouldn't vacate our seats but they could at least honour their seat guarantee scheme (which I had to make 16 separate claims for as we had SplitSave tickets for 8 of us). I make this journey frequently so I gave LNER a chance. Will stick to Thameslink and Great Northern now like I have previously. Never had issues with them",

Disrupted the rest of my journey and no compensation given. Seat reservations is such a scam! You reserve a seat for someone to sit in your place, no green lights to sit and as your journey is in progress someone can book the seat your are sat in?! For a journey over 3 hours i dont want to be disturbed and have to move. Not a thought through process, all it does is annoy people.",

Unfortunately the train was delayed from York for approximately 30 mins due to the theft of signal cables which caused untold chaos on the King's Cross to Edinburgh line.  On the return journey the train was delayed for over 60 mins. I was sent an automated delay repay for the tickets I purchased  for my daughter but not the tickets for myself?  I had to make a claim for my tickets on 06/12/22, there is no way to check the progress of my claim on the website? In fact it is not even possible to check that a claim has been made.  It is now over 6 weeks and the \"chat bot\" is totally useless, I have asked to chat with a person and was cut off. I have sent 2 emails which have not been answered.  Bring back Virgin Trains website it was 100% better and you could even speak to a very helpful person, not a bot that cannot answer a simple question, totally and utterly frustrating.",

Repeat again at the next station 15 minutes later. Sometimes the manager comes on to repeat it yet again. Then unlike every other train company, they constantly announce the See it-Say it slogan.  Every stop.  The signs aren't good enough, nor are the first 100 times they tell you where the train is going.   Not considerate at all of neuro-diverse people or those that just want to relax.

The staff on the train basically told me to shut up and find a seat somewhere else. \n\nCouldn\u2019t find a seat, so I had to resort to sitting on the floor accompanied by other travellers whose seats were also taken from them. I had to sit on a cramped disgusting floor for 2 hours I was left feeling mentally exhausted after the trip. \n\nThen on a separate train ride on the way home I had some luggage stolen (in piece of jewellery). The staff were not very helpful and mocked me for losing it. \n\nI contacted LNER after the trip to try and receive some form of compensation or a refund. They got back to me requesting further details, I obliged and they didn\u2019t respond to my email. \n\nDisgusting train line with horrible staff. Would not recommend.",

No seats people standing and train overcrowded. When at Peterborough, also told the train had broken down the night before and LNER new this but did not send any txts to inform people of this. No catering, no seat and staff on the train had no idea what to do. Newcastle train cleared and seat and some food provided. What a shocking and unprofessional service and LNER new as tge train had broken down the night before!! Really a cheap circus charging people 1st class service.",

Due to strikes I can't make follow up meetings, so intial meetings beforehand have been cancelled. They have refused to refund tickets because apparently the strikes have not disrupted or cancelled my plans. As my initial meeting were not on strike days. They fail to understand people running businesses have follow up meetings. Which happen to be on strike days. I have lost so much business because of the strikes. The strikes are causing a hugely negetaive ripple effect throughout my whole business.  This company constantly gives incorrect refunds when they do refund. Their app is mess. Everything is driven & made difficult to rip the customer off. They want more money I just want to get paid.  The delay and repay doesn't work. They ignore emails, cut phone chat off.

I guess if you need to ask the price, you can't afford. Needless to say very few passengers had food or drink. \nThe biggest problem though was the lack of information throughout the journey (including 3 changes on the way). \nI guess none of this will matter to regular rail travellers, who are famailiar with the routine.\nI can only give two stars.

Although the outbound train was 42-44 mins late due to safety checks on the tracks, I can honestly say that I will not hesitate to use this service again! The staff aboard both journeys were amazing! They were all professional and polite, very hard working, nothing was too much trouble! Our journeys were King\u2019s Cross to Edinburgh 2nd Dec (Peterborough scheduled at 1819) and Edinburgh to Kings Cross 1100hrs 4 Dec.  Please convey our utmost thanks to the staff on both journeys- staff as good and as happy as they all were are very hard to find! We shall definitely use LNER again!! Thank you x",

The first ticket collector seemed very understanding, although I had to pay a ticket costing roughly \u00a340 (the train wasn't full but as usual they won't be sympathetic). I also purchased a second ticket because the train would arrive later than my connecting train. However, the trainline app (also a steaming pile of dung) didn't process my payment for ongoing app issues using my phone. \n\nHowever, the second ticket collector was despicable, to say the least, very condescending and rude and used intimidation tactics against me. No customer service skills whatsoever. She didn't believe me when I said I had purchased a ticket and showed her my bank statement, which showed it had taken my money. \n\nAnyway, she reissued my ticket but, as usual, LNER or any service in the UK demands you to pay a highly inflated ticket price.\n\nLuckily I'm moving overseas soon so I won't have to deal with this country's scandalous public transport system. At my wits' end with LNER, Trainline and the whole public transport system as it completely lacks any semblance of a service for people.",

While they\u2019ll take advantage of people by charging extortionate fees for new tickets if you\u2019ve missed your train and have to get the following train 15 minutes later.

I said it would only take her a second to get onto the train. He said no and then got on the train and closed the doors. He then shouted get off the platform, I was so shocked and startled for a second. He then screamed at the top of his lungs \u201cGet off the f**king platform\u201d. The train then set off. I am really upset and have never been treated like this before, even by drunk members of the public. To be sworn at and screamed at by the level of anger and by a staff member of the service I have paid for. It is the first time my mother has been able to leave home for over two years before covid due to illness and we have had a lovely time in London but what a horrific way to end the trip. Why could we not get on the train? Are the staff not able to assist? I had both of our suitcases and my mother only needed a hand to help her step up onto the train. That was all. I am now having to pay for additional trains and we are both left shocked and if I am honest, shaken.",

That means two passenger loads piling onto the 3.30pm (two into one does not go). All seats reserved, but some had orange lights \"seat may be reserved later\". I asked what that meant and the reply was that others (or I) could book a seat reservation from the next stop. So I try seven times over the course of 90 mins, and the seat reservation LNER service just kept spooling and spooling. Not sure if it was due to lousy WiFi (simple text emails were taking 30 mins each to be sent) or a problem with the seat reservation service. Eventually gave up. Others boarding subsequently had managed to make new seat reservations, ousting those poor folk who thought they were safe. No tea and coffee in first class, and no hot food after Newcastle. Not blaming on board staff but clear disappointment with LNER management (again)",

I was charged \u00a350 for 4 days 2 hours. Emailed them 30th August on the day of the charge. Attached my parking ticket receipt and proof of charge. Had automated email to say I would be contacted in 10 working days. I wasn't. Then finally received an email 18th October saying  I'd been overcharged by \u00a338. I was reimbursed but, why did it take so long, is there a huge backlog of this happening to others?  I was given no explanation as to how it happened. Obviously a computer glitch. It has now really put me off using their carpark in future. Beware!",

When we arrived in Darlington I was kicked out of my seat by a couple claiming to have also booked that seat.  Understandably I was annoyed.  A kind man offered his seat as he was departing in York.  A group of chavs blasting chavvy music from Newcastle to London also graced our presence in the \u2018 quiet coach drinking a bottle of pink gin each on the journey getting more obnoxious. When we were an hour away from London I looked over at them as they put their music up louder. One asked why are you looking at me. I explained I booked a quiet coach and you and your friends have been blasting music all the journey. I was subjected to a load of verbal abuse calling me a Karen.. seriously\u2026.he was the one who asked me why I was annoyed. Prior to that I sat and looked out of the window to zone out He then called me a racist word for an \u2018Indian or Pakistani person\u2019 bi@@c.  Btw I don\u2019t condone racist comments and also I\u2019m clearly white European but perhaps the bottle of gin he\u2019d drank clouded his vision.  Other passengers apologised to me for this treatment. I wanted to move seats but the train was full. Wish I\u2019d saved \u00a3100 and got the mega bus.  Oh and these chavs were apprehended at kings cross as I was leaving the station they claimed to have lost their ticket and were detained,  karma hey.",

I am heavily pregnant and was travelling with my toddler so this was a bit stressful, particularly as trains and stations were busier than usual. \n\nThere were two trains leaving from Doncaster Platform 1 to Kings Cross within minutes of each other and unbeknown to myself, I had accidentally got on the wrong train. This was an honest mistake.\n\nI was treated appallingly by the staff member when he pointed out I had boarded the wrong train. He initially told me I would need to pay over \u00a3100 then said he would charge \u00a363.\n\nI was told that if I did not pay he would get British Transport Police I believe this was said to intimidate me. He tried to put me under duress to make an immediate payment and he behaved in a confrontational manner, standing over me whilst I was seated with my young child.\n\nWhen the train arrived in London two British Transport Police officers were waiting for me - this was upsetting for my young child and distressing and humiliating for me.  No arrest was made,the police acknowledged I was not trying to fare evade as I had a valid ticket and they accepted my explanation that I made a mistake by boarding the train (rather than my booked train which also departed from platform 1 six minutes later.) The officers advised  this was not an issue for them as I had not committed any criminal offence.The officers stated the worker could have exercised some \u2018professional discretion\u2019 and they advised me put in a complaint and appeal. Up until this point I was not even aware I could appeal.\n \n I am sure the police resources could have been put to better use elsewhere.",

It is then announced that there would be a rail strike on October 1st. so I contacted LNER to see what contingency plans had been put in place to get us back after a short silence on the phone the call centre operative said they would not be providing any optional transport for our return (Hmmm. not happy). The cost of the show and hotel had cost a couple of thousand pounds so we couldn't just not go. I managed to book a couple of seats on a National Express coach to get us back to doncaster (no problems here) the first outbound leg by train was cancelled without notice (Scun to Don) which meant I had to get a family member to drive us to Doncaster. While on the platform at doncaster a train duly pulled in and I asked an LNER employee if this was the train that I needed to be on and her attitude was appalling as her only concern was to get the train out, we as passengers seemed to irk the woman, and so to cap it all no trains on Saturday October 1st, who cares we've got your money now. I have to ask, why on earth would anyone want to travel by train? What a disgrace.",

It is such a pity that the first class seats used to be really comfortable. I understand that the company would like to make more profits and puts more seats in first class carriages.

But it transpires that if you selected e-tickets on your original booking then e-tickets is what you'll get for any amendment too. Collecting tickets at the station (known as: Tickets on Departure) can't be done. I think this needs to change because you're making it harder for me when you don't have to. \n\nBut that said the Geordie guy that i spoke to was really very sympathetic and helpful in suggesting the library to get my amended e-ticket printed, which i did.

Hot menu is great, but recently, on my 10 trips with LNER, only once have I been served this. The rest has been their \"light deli menu\" with a really poor choice of sandwiches. Also, options in the first class lounges really limited.\n\nOn the flip side of all this, I absolutely love LNER's delay repay. Considering how much effort you have to go to with other companies. With LNER, if your train is delayed by more than 30 minutes, 10 minutes after getting to your destination, you get an email asking you if you want to receive your refund. Click the link, and the money is paid back usually within 24 hours. (Enable one click delay repay for this to happen on your LNER account).",

Arrived at the station at 1730 for our 1748 return train when it arrived was told the previous train tickets was valid on this one.so then the stampede began. I cannot believe how ignorant people can be could not get a seat and was in the corridor where the carriages join up with my 6 year old grandson and 7 month pregnant daughter. At this point we could not move either way and my daughter got very panicky about how full it was she sat on the floor and started to cry. Next an announcement came over that we could go on another train less full on another platform so got off to then be pushed out of the way by people getting on this train my 6 year old grandson and pregnant daughters are so upset there's no organisation whatsoever  We then had a technical fault delaying the train and 2 stops due to congestion so arrived at our station at 2050 what a traumatic and stressful experience that has put us all off travelling by train what's the point in booking a seat.",

        "review_text": "Our trip with LNER was wonderful on 12 Aug 22 from Peterborough to Newcastle.  I has arranged passenger assist which I had never used before.  First they got in touch with me right away regarding my needs and special requests.  Originally we could not book seats together when I looked at the seat map but they were able to get us seats together by the time of our trip.  We  didn't expect that. In the station itself, I was escorted to the waiting room then the passenger assist staff came back when it was time to meet my train.  They helped with a ramp on the train and were very friendly.  Getting off the train, a staff member met us at the door of the train with a wheelchair, which I was glad to have as there was quite a bit of walking.  Since the staff member was just about to quit for the day, she even wheeled me to my hotel across the street.  Amazing service! The trip from Newcastle to Peterborough was wonderful until we got to Grantham.  Again, we had great seats together and the hot meal was quite good.  We were seated where the door to the disabled toilet was very obvious.  One suggestion, put a notice on the door to not start anything until the passenger is certain the door is closed all the way.  Several times men got themselves in position before the door was closed,  we could not see anything fortunately.  Also, put a notice on the walls of all the toilets for the men to put the seat down.  Several times I had to put the seat down and there was only toilet tissue not paper towels to touch the seat with.  The trip was wonderful until we got to Grantham.  All the trains going south were cancelled at this point due to a overhead wire issue, for which we don't fault the train company.  We were given assistance off the train then it was up to us to make arrangements.  Fortunately we were only one stop away and a taxi was already arranged so it came and got us at Grantham.  We were told we would gave a refund for our disrupted trip. Overall, we are extremely pleased with LNER and will use them again. The overhead wire issue just past our final destination was just bad luck.",

I had booked a return journey from Edinburgh to filey which meant two connections (Lner to york then catch another two not lner) so my journey down was pretty OK (for someone with severe anxiety and travelling alone) however, 10 minutes from York Station and the train stops! Well that's me upto ninety from then on in, faulty overhead wires hanging had us sitting there in spitting distance of my stop for 3 hours. The lady i was meeting had to drive to york station as id missed all my connections. Then some eejit came running down the train telling us we're all getting sent back to Edinburgh...holy hell that's me doing a full on lioness with a headache from Satan's spell book. Took a total panic attack and was trying to get off anyway I could. Train manager (debbie) I think her name was, came got me and my bag and moved me to first class and explained that we were still going to york. Phew!! Crisis averted...hmm I think not. Gets off in york picks up what I went for and because of the 3 hour delay I had to get straight back on the return train...which was rammed like a scene from a really crappy 80s concert. I had to sit on the floor with my dog (very large, strong dog) between the doors all the way back to Edinburgh despite booking a seat, with a table so the dog could go under. Absolutely furious at that tbh. Had to get up and haul the dog from one side to another repeatedly as folk wanting a bottle of water or just a nosey. For someone who never leaves the house because of appalling anxiety this journey for me was most definitely the worst experience I've had and one I will never repeat. I don't care if I wake up in London, drunk with no clothes on...I'll just move there. I'm still waiting on my refund two weeks later...\u00a3131.20 to sit on a dirty floor?! Great to get my money back but where is it??? The Mixed opinion I mentioned is due to the staff, the train manager was fab and a chap not working that day (for lner) but travelling in first class sat down with me to help calm me down he was even so good as to walk me right through york Station to meet the person I was down to see. He was great and helped me tremendously. So the journey = \ud83d\udc4ebut the staff = \u2b50\ufe0f",

There is nothing first class about travelling first class!\n\nOn both occasions we did not buy food having checked your menu. On Friday we were told there was no hot food on board. Then told you only had egg sandwiches for vegetarians. I assume you realise that most vegetarians these days don\u2019t eat eggs? Then told to give the buffet car a shot - again only non egg choice was not possible as you were not doing hot sandwiches. Can\u2019t believe the comment from your staff that food is not part of the fare and is complimentary so don\u2019t expect it!!!!!! What exactly am I paying for then? If I\u2019d known i advance I would have bought the food at KX. Instead we starved\n\nReturn trip was no better. Egg sandwiches again. Shameful. Starving again. Why as first paying passenger should I have to clear tables and brush down seats which are littered in food?",

        "review_text": "We travelled from London to Edinburgh on one of the new-fangled Azuma trains.  They look the part, sleek and stylish on the outside.  Inside, the seats were a little on the hard side and being slightly above average in height and, ahem, waist size, the seats proved just a little bit tight.  The train was completely packed; nonetheless, our two reserved seats were there empty as expected and there was just about enough room for us to stash our four mid-sized rucksacks on the overhead racks.  The ride was generally very smooth although the many curves north of Darlington were a little interesting!  The staff on board were really polite and welcoming, as were the staff at the barriers at Kings Cross. Perhaps when the Azumas go for their first upgrade/refurbishment (2029?), or even beforehand based on customer experience after 3 years of being in service (!!!!!!), LNER could upgrade the seats with a little more padding?  All in all, a pleasant journey.",

I am appalled and had the worst journey I could have imagined. My connecting train was late and therefore my reservation seat was null and void. For the cost of a ticket there should be a system where reservations after connecting train delays are secured so customers on earlier bookings have somewhere to sit if and when things go wrong. Especially when it is not within the customers control. Appalled. Drive if you can - or take a coach. At least you\u2019ll be able to sit down.",

LNER is no different.  My train was delayed nearly 2 hours, yet my flights were on time getting back to the final stretch to the north east.  Sadly my expectations of trains in the UK is very low so to be offered a refund was nice.  Customers were giving the staff some really nasty abuse which is unacceptable when I waited patiently for a LNER train to get back home.  However what annoys me is when you ask for a refund and go through the forms online (a simple process thankyou!) and they say please wait up to 10 working days for a response for your refund.  It is now been over a month and not even a email to say we are very busy you will be contacted as soon as possible.  This is the problem communication is lacking.  I had to go and type in my case reference: LNER-220628-BRFD  into mr robot live chat (with a computer)!\n\nand it says it has been sent to the relevant train provider - not helpful! could someone explain what's happening? \"relevant train provider\" that would be LNER! \u2026some communication would be great on this matter, thank you.",

One bottle of water to share amongst 6. 2 minutes notice train was terminating at Edinburgh. Manager announcemed he would arrange alternative transportation for people going past Edinburgh. He then stayed in the train for an hour till the platform clear so no questions to answer. Pensioners and families with no idea how to get home or where to seek help.

        "review_text": "Where do I start? On Saturday 2nd July it was my first time in First Class for LNER. For a 30 minute trip (Newcastle to Darlington) it cost me \u00a317.60 (2x 15 year olds). That totals out to \u00a38.75 per person. Which I believe is an outstanding value for money. The train was quiet and smooth and fast (Coach L). Catering was offered swiftly with Friendly staff. The snacks also came round which was amazing. For 30 minutes as a short journey I would not expect much. However, LNER went above and beyond to make it that bit better! Upon arrival in Darlington we went to the first class lounge. The lounge was a very relaxing place to rest for 30 minutes. There was one slight problem\u2026 the hot drinks machine was not working. But for me that was not a problem at all. (I\u2019m sure LNER are responsible enough to fix it quickly). So would I recommend the extra money for this trip? Yes I certainly would because LNER also do their absolute best and it\u2019s clear! It\u2019s a nice way to have a quick chill! \nOn the other hand LNER also were outstanding with how fast they were with the Refunds. I brought One too many tickets to Darlington. So, LNER have this really easy one click refund system. First thing this morning, I have an email saying that the refund Is on its way. No hassle at all problem free. Well done and thank you to LNER for making all of this possible. \n\nOutstanding!",

More people making comments but Staff not even bothered. \n\nThank god my journey ended.\n\nI called C/S due to emergency I had to enquire about changing station on return.  SADLY passed onto female who said \u201cread small print, terms and conditions and put down phone\u201d\n\nI STUPIDLY booked another 1st class from Dundee to Edinburgh hoping first train was just a one off. Absolutely not, still abysmal, same issue, awful carriage, just different staff. No food, did get 1 drink though. \n\nOne the worst travel experiences in a long long time. Save yourself the hassle and either fly up, or get the cheapest possible ticket you can in standard class then at least you don\u2019t feel like you are being royally screwed. \n\nA prerequisite on getting a job with LNER and not just on their trains, is to have attended the Vinnie Jones Charm school.\n\nThere has to be better than this. \n\nLner you supply misinformation on your website, carriages do not look as they do, food definitely not served or offered as advertised. SHAME ON YOU.\n\nAVOID",

        "review_text": "A few times each year I join the Kings Cross to Inverness train at York. I have done this since it was run by Virgin, GNER and now LNER. My last journey, just a week ago, I booked standard class and used the Seatfrog app to upgrade the return journey to first class.\n\nThere are positives. The train staff were helpful and communicative, particularly when we were held for an hour due to a rail defect. The delay repay was seamless too: received an email to confirm I'd like to claim, clicked the link and then a few days later the money was in the bank. The leg room in standard class is great but not all is rosy.\nThe advance ticket price was excellent thanks to me checking constantly and being ready as they were added.\n\nThe negatives. I've never had an issue with my back on any long journey by car, train or plane. I found the seats on the Azuma in standard class are thin and uncomfortable, my back was aching well before we reached our destination. The seats aren't much better in first class but the recline seems to make the difference. Leg room in first is no better than standard, particularly if you're at a table.\nPart of the first class experience, and you would have though partly justifying the hike in cost, used to be the food and drink. That service has been run down. The food options are mixed but what I found was that the advertised dish menu for this service was replaced with the cheaper looking deli menu. Some items were unavailable and some were so limited that they'd run out before we were few stops beyond Inverness. The food and drink is now rationed. My journey was for 6 hours which meant one item from the breakfast menu which could be a single satsuma, apple of pastry. I opted for what seemed more substantial, a ciabatta. The only option other than tea and coffee was a single bottle of water.\nThe lunch menu came into force much later into the journey and comprised a sandwich or wrap, a bag of crisps and a single drink. The only option in between those \"meals\" was tea or coffee.\nI had a much better menu on the standard journey on the way up - one that I'd made up myself with the help of Pret and M&S.\n\nI wish I hadn't paid for first class on the return, the extra cost wasn't reflected in the benefits it offered. I'll bring a support pillow for the next time I travel in standard :-)",

I was met with \u201cmadam do you want to get home \u2026. Then listen to what I am telling you\u201d. It was in such a rude fashion. I asked him why he had such an attitude. As a midwife matron I know how to handle a difficult patient. But this man spoke to me like a was dirt on his shoe. I do recognise working Easter Sunday isn\u2019t nice but I was all smiley and lovely and pleasant. However the team on the platform that helped us get a train were fantastic. They were thorough and calming, organised and methodical. There were x3 gentleman and a lady and they were simply fantastic. Thank you team. Sorry your colleague at the info desk let you down.",

I would like to give a huge amount of credit and a massive thank you to a lovely lady with the most kind heart especially who works with LNER, I did not catch her name but she helped me onto the train with my pram and suitcase, she was constantly making sure I was okay and even offered to hold my little one for 5 mins to give me a break and calm myself down, she deserves a lot more than just a thank you!

Halfway there and I've got so much as to them requesting the same information I've already sent. Gets better as we go to raise a complaint you also have to email them patronizing really that all the service is provided on emails and it doesn't even seem like it is responded to. Might as well put a monkey behind a computer and you'd get more sense out of them. I want my money back. AWFUL SERVICE",

        "review_text": "Travelled on a number of LNER trains over a very stormy few days (Storm Dudley, Storm Eunice) and we were very impressed with the level of information and care the company provided for customers, and their determination to run trains and get people to their destinations unless it became unsafe.  We are more used to Scotrail cancelling services as soon as any adverse weather is forecast.  There were plenty of staff at the stations we used (York, Darlington, Newcastle) ready and keen to help us.  This was really appreciated as we were travelling with children.  The main downside to our trips was the catering onboard.  This was generally poor and there were technical problems with coffee machines on two journeys and with the payment system on another.  There doesn't appear to be any trolley service on any train and the choice at the tiny buffet is disappointing, but again the staff did their best and were very professional.  Otherwise the service was good though we too really noticed the rock hard seats on the Azumas that seem to be a major disappointment for many customers.",

Your representative was also encouraging us to get the train back to Newcastle or south, but I had business to attend to.\n\nAs a result of all this i missed a business flight I had to Birmingham from Edinburgh. \n\nI expect to get a full refund for my train tickets as well as reimbursement for my flights which cost me money as I could not attend my business meeting. \nI attach the tickets. \n\nWe are having these back and forth emails asking for information with people getting back to me after 5 days asking stuff I already have provided. Promising refunds but if you don't get it in 14 working days let us know so you can wait another 5 working days to get a respond to your email and 14 working days to get the money back. Just do your job already.",

        "title": "Edinburgh First Class Lounge Experience",
        "review_text": "Edinburgh First Class Lounge Experience.\n\nOn 7 February I took the 10:42 LNER service from Newcastle to Edinburgh to meet up with my daughter for a day out in the city.\nHaving arrived in Waverley Station at around 12:11 I headed to the First Class Lounge to wait for my daughter who was due to arrive from Leuchars at 12:25.  We had decided to meet up in the Edinburgh First Class lounge as we were both travelling with first class tickets.  I have travelled to Edinburgh quite often in recent times and normally buy a first class ticket due to the perk of being able to use the lounge for arrival and departure which I find makes the journey more convivial.\nHowever, today, when I attempted to enter the lounge, the lady at the desk (initial K) told me, in a rather brusque fashion, that the lounge was at full capacity.  A sign to that effect was also stuck on the glass panel in front of where she was seated. I accepted this at face value. I asked if i could sit down on one of the five chairs by the front desk but was told it was only for handicapped customers. I therefore went outside and waited by the side of the entrance door for my daughter\u2019s arrival.  \n\nA minute or so later a lady with a large suitcase walked into the Lounge. I expected to see her walk straight out again as no one had exited the lounge since I had been refused entry and it therefore must have remained at full capacity. I was consequently very surprised when I saw she was completing the track and trace procedures and was then allowed to enter.  \n\nWhile considering what I had just seen occurring I saw two people leave the lounge so I walked back in, pointed at the 2 people who had left and asked if I could now enter.  The attendant,  nodded and after having checked my ticket instructed me to scan the track and trace bar code. Her attitude was less than professional.\nIn the lounge I looked around and counted only 10 people seated inside. The lounge looked rather empty and I began to wonder at the now seemingly incongruous \u201cat full capacity\u201d statement with which I had initially been met. \n10 minutes or so later 2 more people left the lounge without any fresh customers appearing and then a few minutes after that my daughter called me on my mobile to say she wasn\u2019t able to come up to the lounge as the lady at the desk had indicated that the lounge was full by tapping the full capacity sign stuck on the glass panel  in front of her.\nI therefore went down to meet my daughter outside.   On my way out I spoke with K informing her that there had been only 10 people inside the lounge including me and that I had seen 2 of those leave shortly before my daughter tried  to enter.  This did not appear to have any interest to K who told me that she has other things to do (not sure what she meant by that comment).  This was not the response I had anticipated and fell rather short of the customer service that one might expect of a First Class Lounge attendant. At this point I told her that I would write to customer service about this experience to which  she, in a challenging voice, said \u201cgo ahead\u2026go ahead\u201d.\nI do not know if this level of service and rather rude behaviour on K\u2019s part is an isolated incident brought on by external factors or if it is more a normal state of affairs.\n\nIt may be that the lounge in these Covid times does in fact have a formal reduced capacity for safety\u2019s sake -  although 10 customers does seem a rather small number given it\u2019s size - in which case a displayed notice to that effect would go some way towards explaining the situation to those being turned away should the attendant on duty not wish to pass that information on to customers in person.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is no actual formal \u201c10 persons maximum\u201d limit policy in effect one wonders why the front desk staff implemented such a limit on that day.\n\nWhile I do not have any direct evidence of  bias I would also point out that my daughter and I are of Asian extraction while the lady who was allowed to enter the lounge immediately after I had been turned away was not (as were all the other customers I saw inside the lounge).  I am therefore at a loss as to why I was denied entry and that lady was allowed in. I feel that my experience should not go  unnoticed and would appreciate clarification on LNER present policy regarding lounge capacity and confirmation that my initial denial of entry and subsequently that of my daughter were in fact due to  reasons other than our ethnicity.\n\nI have sent photos and videos of the lounge along with my above comments to LNER customer service\u2019s email.\n\n15 Feb 2022,  received reply from LNER Customer Service (sent email to them on 7 Feb).  Their reply is a long winded email of what essentially said 'thank you, we received your feedback and we'll handle it.  Sorry for your experience but we can't tell you anything else (not even the lounge capacity numbers)'.  Very disappointing.",

We wondered if they were holding our reserved seats even though we\u2019d not paid yet so called LNER for help. We were told seats had sold out only first class left which was an addition \u00a3100. The person we spoke to didn\u2019t know if it was the seats we had \u2018reserved\u2019 that was making the train full and could only offer a later train or first class. So we said we\u2019d have the later train as the hotel was already booked and we didn\u2019t have a choice. Again we tried to reserve seats and the representative couldn\u2019t sit 3 of us next to each other despite there being seat availability for this to happen? So we gave up again and tried ourselves 5 minutes later and the original seats were then available. However because the system did not allow us to book last night we have ended up paying more.  Very poor online booking system and looks like it\u2019s stating an error when in fact this is potentially because a chosen seat is not available. This has cost us money.",

Always get my reserved seat and the LNER Perks is also a great idea as you can use it to get money off future journeys.\n\n2 days ago I booked a return journey from Newcastle to Kings X. On completing my booking I realised I'd made a mistake and had booked the wrong train for my outbound journey so I had to book another outbound journey separately. At this point I didn't realise there was an option to amend my booking. Even though it was 100% my error I placed a request for a refund for my origional outbound journey and less than 48 hours later I've received an email saying my request has been approved, much to my surprise and delight. That's excellent customer service and its also the same level of service I've received whilst travelling on their trains. Great service.",

Turned out. We entered the wrong train and our lumo train heading to edingburgh left. I've spoke to the staff at kings cross from Lner and they said they can't help since it's lumos fault for showing the wrong platform information. While kings cross Staff blamed us claiming that were lying about it, for some reason. I was adviced to contact lumo directly about this issue as I wanted a refund for my tickets since I got misleaded, Lumo got back to me following my complain of missed train and as it turned out. KINGS CROSS IS OPERATED AND RUN BY LNER. So yes, it looked like a scheme so that people have to pay more money for train and end up going with lner, and now it turns out that its true.",

        "review_text": "This pertains to the 17:00 LNER Kings Cross to Durham 21st November, which I feel so strongly about as it put people's lives at risk and saw some seriously devious and underhand practices by LNER!\n\nTo keep this as brief as possible: \n\nLNER took on board ALL of the cancelled Grand Central passengers without telling their own passengers meaning the train would be full before boarding commenced.\n\nLNER did not update the wallboards during this time to say which platform we were to use. \n\nLNER put out an announcement, 15 minutes prior to departure advising passengers to go to Euston station to seek alternative travel...I suspect this was an afterthought having realised your own train was already full and you had nowhere to put your own paying customers so wanted to buy some time and divert people away to deal with their complaints at a later time. \n\nLNER kept crowds of people at the platform barriers (the boards had still not been updated, it was just pure luck we'd found the right one!) preventing access until they knew which platform we were to go to. People were becoming impatient jumping the barriers at this point.\n \nLNER opened the barriers without telling people which platform to go to, resulting in the hoard of people rushing through the barriers. This is how crushing injuries come about! (did the recent Travis Scott concert not teach you anything?!) This was disgustingly dangerous for those of us with small children. \n\nLNER kept passengers at another barrier to the platform (again, pure luck we'd found the right one as no-one had told us which to go to!) and were asking for Edinburgh only passengers only to board. I suspect this was because you knew the train was full and could not accommodate those travelling to stations along the way, so only wanted the few passengers who were travelling to the end destination. \n\nLNER eventually allowed all passengers to board at the last minute, but unsurprisingly the train was indeed full with Grand Central passengers in the seats which had been purchased by LNER customers. \n\nLNER did nothing to promote social distancing or adhere to any Covid19 guidelines by cramming as many people as possible in each car. It was so full, people were lying on the floors in the areas between cars. \n\nThe journey back was nothing short of horrific due to having to remove passengers from our reserved seats, the inability to socially distance and being stuck with a group of disruptive/drunk females. \n\nThis was of course all put to LNER as a complaint which they offered a full refund + compensation. However, they have since reneged on the compensation and are now ignoring me. \n\nShameful. \n\nLNER, if you do read this and feel compelled to do your best corporate copy/paste in an attempt to discredit anything I've highlighted, please go ahead, I dare you. Alternatively, the complaint ref is: LNER-211122-BCTP - Make it right.",

At Edinburgh told abruptly by LNER staff at the platform that there was no room on the train and to go to the bus. Very confusing as we didn't know where to go, same as other passengers. Finally on bus, noisy journey, people drinking, singing, no masks. My daughter got covered in someone's lager. Was a terrible journey. 4 hours late to Aberdeen, missed the last bus and had to get a taxi home. Total stress and around \u00a340 out of pocket for taxis and extra meals etc. Tried to claim compensation since August. Still nothing. Tried twice to fill the form, been in huge phone queues, tried twitter but no reply. What a terrible company indeed.",

        "review_text": "My message to LNER and their inadequate reply! Totally shocking and disappointing! \n\nI need to let you know how disappointed I have found my journey on your train today. Its my husbands 50th birthday weekend and I treated him to a first class train trip. It is anything but first class. We boarded the 8am train at kings cross to Edb. The team that took over at Newcastle are just plain rude. One team member openly sniffing and grunting her way through drink service. The hot choc and hot food offering has run out. We were rudely told at 11 am that as we got on a kings cross we were not allowed anything more to eat or others would go without.  Nor would they be serving alcohol as they dont have time. Last week I traveled first class with Avanti to Glasgow. Their service was truly first class and I naively thought we would be treated to the same wonderful service. I was wrong. Lner could learn a few things from Avanti about what a first class service should offer. But most of all Im disappointed for my husband. A 50th birthday weekend should be special and this has certainly not got our weekend off to the best start.\n\nLNER reply:\nVery sorry to hear that, Susan. I hope you enjoy your weekend and that we can do better on your return. ^AB",

        "review_text": "I booked passenger assistance arrival/departure (four days later) on behalf of my elderly sister who has particular health needs. At Glasgow there was no one to meet us but the brilliant staff communicated our needs, waited with us and ensured we were safely transported on the 'buggy' that deposited us near the taxi rank. On the return journey, we arrived at the station early, were given a warm place to wait and transported to our carriage when the train arrived. Fantastic service on both occasions. On arrival home at Doncaster an employee offered us assistance by taking my sister's arm, carrying her case and was just generally incredibly helpful and good humored. I never used these services before as had no need for them but think it's excellent that they are available for people who require them.  I must also say that the staff, particularly on the outward journey, were exceptional. We had been allocated single seats which were not suitable so moved to an available table which was indicated to us. A female member of staff carried our cases to the new carriage. We enjoyed the drinks on offer and the food, although nothing special and no hot food available, was perfectly adequate. I thought the teamwork and camaraderie between staff was lovely to see and hear. They certainly made our journey very comfortable and actually it would not have been possible without the assistance we received.  So on behalf of my sister and myself a massive thank you to all involved for your kindness, consideration and efforts in reassuring us and just enabling us to make this special trip to see our relatives in Glasgow. Merry Christmas to you all!!",

First class from Edinburgh to London now consists of a bacon roll (nice enough) a cold tea and they don\u2019t do sweeteners, 2 drinks, 1 snack and demanded their glasses back 40 mins before we arrived.

I was kept waiting 2 hours on the phone before I got through to an assistant, he said we can\u2019t send you your tickets as there waiting in the machine, so all we can do is send you a voucher, but he said the tickets have doubled in price, but we can only issue you the voucher for the price of your tickets but we will give you an extra \u00a3100 to help you out. But he had attached the voucher to my old card so I still couldn\u2019t print the tickets as the voucher was attached to the cancelled card. I think it is a disgrace the way they handled my situation all they had to do was send me the tickets rip off total rip off, but now my husband had Covid so I\u2019ve claimed a refund and I am Ill my self so can\u2019t go anyway.

        "review_text": "Travelled 1st class.. Edinburgh to London 9th Nov 2021 and returned 12th Nov . Seats were OK.  Headrest covers were dirty. The staff were pleasant enough. The food...Well that's another story. The CEO wants to try the ciabatta. Cheese/ tomato and mushroom. Sounds quite decent. A warm soggy slimy mushroom filled peice of pasty bread was my take. One bite and in the bin it went same for my husband. Tea and coffee/ water etc offered here and there. A brownie and some crisps. Well it was a mouthful of each. Later came the bacon roll. I don't like tomato nor brown sauce, so I had a dry  uninteresting roll with salty bacon to keep me going with my mouthful of brownie and 2 mouthfuls of crisps for my breakfast. Then there was lunch. Whatever happend to just a cheese and tomato sandwich or ham and mustard. I explained I didn't like any of them so I was handed 2 pkts crisps and a brownie. One pitiful glass of wine was all that time allowed. They took their time in bringing that out. On the return journey that was a different matter. We had the sense to buy sandwiches beforehand. Declined offerings of the slimey ciabatta and dry roll and again the sandwiches. But I did get 2 packets of crisps. I asked the staff member what else can you do as I don't like any of them. Again I was handed the 2 packs of crisps !! For some reason the trolleys were more frequent in this service and wine was offered more than coming down. Toilets were dirty. I came back out. I think they ended up closing it off. Why on earth do they not have someone on board to tend to such ? Given the amount of people that use the facility. There were people using the service who clearly never paid for 1st class. A lady boarded with a booked seat ticket and the woman and her daughter who were clearly fare dodgers and kept jumping about different seats  just looked away. The poor woman said I will go and see if I can get a seat elsewhere.  I feel this is something that should be looked at in great detail. The ticket examiner just shouts tickets from blah blah.....so if you sit there and act like you've been on the train for ages and have paid full price you get away with it. Which is infuriating if you have paid a couple of hundred pounds. I think LNER Should stop with your existing excuse for food just serve what people can actually eat. It will save you money if nothing else. Offer butter with the bacon roll as I binned the entire roll and ate the 2 medallions of bacon. I am aware I am just one person and my opinion is not that of a majority. Taking it back to \"family favourites\" I am sure will save a lot of waste and money. Be more thorough in checking tickets and ensure your customers are in their paid seats. I felt so sorry for the woman as she had a member of staff help her to the train. Obviously didn't want confrontation.  Walked on struggling with her luggage. Perhaps more visibility from the on board train manager would help in these situations. Put a poster up if someone is In your seat or you have an issue call....the on-board train manager on.. blah blah.  If you travel 1st class ...take your own food or eat well before you board. It was a good service as in ran to time. Staff were pleasant. Rubbish was lifted constantly. Another suggestion would be to sanitise the tables. Door buttons and handles. This is just a simple spray. The amount of people in and out of the coaches deems this necessary in my opinion.",

She takes my ticket from myself and says that\u2019s receipt not a physical ticket, as I explained my friend has got the other tickets I\u2019m going to see him on the train just needed the platform she advised me I will not be travelling until I buy a ticket although I had already spent \u00a3120, and simply wanted to get home after advising this she showed little to no empathy and actually tried to get me kicked out the station even the security guard where baffled by her and just done it to keep her happy, they told me to get on the next train after she goes which I didn\u2019t and got on for free as nobody even checked the tickets, there is nice people who work for LNER but unfortunately to have a job as a ticket guard is very powerful to powerful for the likes of this lady. I\u2019d like to say very very bad things about this lady however she clearly lives a very miserable life therefore I will just wish her every success and hopefully she will improve her customer service and not actually try and ruin people\u2019s life.

This was always the case when I have travelled first class in the past.\nOn boarding at Newcastle, I thought I had the wrong carriage. It was packed. A big group of noisy drunk guys with bottles of wine and it looked just like standard class.\nThe seats are very uncomfortable, hard and no more leg room than standard. Awkwardly placed headrests mean you can\u2019t sit back fully in the seat.  The toilet was dirty with no soap.\nThe train staff came round with cold and hot drinks trolleys. On the third time I asked if there was no food this at this time at night. (Politely). The man said \u201cthere is, you must have been asleep\u201d. I said \u201ci haven\u2019t been asleep,  just unsure if I have to actually ask for food?\u201d He said there is food I have been around. I said I had seen him and he had a hot drinks trolley and he offered hot drinks .. then he reached into the drawer of his trolley and chucked a sandwich on the table. I asked him what it was, because I\u2019m vegetarian. He took it back and threw a different one on the table..\nSo, this isn\u2019t what I was expecting having paid for First class! \nThis was meant to be a treat for me.

They were both so cold standing out on the platform on a miserable day but no one would notice because of their cheery demeanour. Thank you both so very much. LNER staff always helpful in my opinion.

On the plus side, the staff on the train couldn't have been nicer and we were well looked after. What does let the service down is the annoying seat and table design which can really irritate on a 4-5 hour journey. The headrests are too big which force you into a very upright position. I found it best to remove the head rest and use it as a much needed additional armrest.\nThe seats are also pretty thin for long distance travel and the hard plastic trim around the table edge is actually painful on wrists and arms. Just a woeful design that should be addressed by LNER. \nStill, the West Coast experience has been totally trashed by Avanti so choices are limited these days.",

        "review_text": "First time booking a train since shielding and felt pretty worried about the whole thing. The LNER website is tricky to use on a mobile - lots of jumping about/ crashing/ not being able to read text properly. Very frustrating but I liked that you could reserve seats easily so I persisted. \n\nAfter filling in the details to book my ticket and painstakingly checking it, I pressed the payment button to complete the transaction. The thing crashed and the website said there was a technical fault. \n\nI had enough of it by then so I booked on with another train provider with no problems whatsoever. Problem solved - or so I thought. \n\nLater tonight, I got an email saying LNER has taken payment after all and issued tickets. argggh! So I now have two sets of tickets for the same journey! And at \u00a380 quid a go, it isn\u2019t cheap. \n\nI am waiting to hear back from them to see if they will refund me my money as I have two sets of tickets for the same journey which I wouldn\u2019t obviously have if their website had worked properly. Am now pretty grumpy about the whole thing but holding out hope that it can be sorted out promptly. \n\nWill update on progress here.\n\n12/10/2021 - Contacted them again via the chat function and they issued a full refund straight away! Was expecting a difficult and lengthy process but LNER sorted it all out very efficiently. So have to change my original one star rating to five stars. Very pleasantly surprised by how they dealt with the problem. Thank you and well done LNER.",

When I booked the website was showing as a 10 car service, upon arriving at Kings cross was informed that the service is only 5 carriages long. Boarding commenced 20 minutes prior to departure. Got on board and the train manager announced there was no reservations on this service as it was only a 5 car service not a 10, which was a good job as someone else had same seat reservations, seats had been doubled booked, this combined with being short formed and services to Leeds been cut to hourly meant that all seats were taken. We departed Kings Cross to Leeds on time and the journey was smooth enough. Went up to the cafe bar to grab a coffee and the coffee is quite nice, staff were friendly enough. Over heard staff saying that this happens on a regular basis with them cutting services to 5 carriages and on most journeys the services are packed with not enough seats, they also went into mention that this service was quiet. Arrived into Leeds on time. Overall the experience was normal to say the least, friendly staff and on time arrival was nice, but the lack of carriages and short forming would make me think twice about using them again, specially as it sounds like a regular occurrence.",

I know there\u2019s been a pandemic but what\u2019s dangerous about putting out stuff to make our own drinks, and a few packets of crisps and biscuits. They managed it at Kings Cross!

Well done the cleaners.\n\nFellow passengers less so.\n\nWeekend off peak trains are busy. Get used to having your social distancing removed and to be surrounded by those without masks.\n\nPeak trains slightly better but forget the myth that you will have social distancing and everyone is masked.\n\nFor some that will be a positive in its own right, but from observation even those sans mask appear to like the seat next to them empty.\n\nI don't think people are ready to sit next to a stranger for hours on end at the moment (Aug 21).\n\nThat being said, it going to happen.\n\nFares, get an advance fare and you will save a bit albeit at the expense of flexibility.

        "review_text": "LNER\u2019s shamefully poor service has been causing nothing but grief lately. Having to travel between Leeds and London quite frequently, I have the misfortune of using this service on regular basis. Nine out of ten times an email is sent out shortly before the upcoming trip, telling me that they have decided to remove some of the coaches and my seat reservations are now useless. When contacting customer care, they very calmly advise to take ANY seat on the trin without a problem. I followed their advice once and, on the trip back from London I was moved TWICE at different stations by people waving their tickets at me. I was going home from doctor\u2019s appointment and was in a lot of discomfort and pain and would have loved to be left alone. No luck! \n IF one chooses to amend the journey instead, to \u201csecure\u201d a seat reservation, LNER has taken upon themselves to extract even more money from people who have already paid far too much for a simple trip that is constantly being messed around with. The amendment can be done on the phone for no charge; however, the new amended journey \u201cticket\u201d will surely cause more trouble during the journey.  I spent quite some time proving to the gentleman checking my ticket (showing the emails and the PDF ticket), that I was not hitching a free ride and the new ticket was, in fact, sent by their own customer care. He looked unconvinced and marched off looking furious. What can I say? \n\nUpdate 25th August: my last trip to London proved to be the most chaotic yet. NO seating reservation was made (even though requested) from Leeds to Doncaster and the train from Doncaster to London was the train of misery. It appeared that they have sold tickets to fill 9 coaches, however the actual train had only 5. They have already hit rock bottom with their disregard for their customers.  Avoid at all costs! I\u2019ll be moving back to London just to avoid being forced to use this service. Horrid!!!",

Only 2 serving out of the 4 kiosks ( totally inadequate for a busy station) and 7 in the queue l stood there 11mins in which time 2 people in infront of me had given up and left the queue l finally got to the counter and asked my question about my return journey, I then heard swearing and looked around to see about 15 people in the queue! and 2 people walking out of it!. So l asked the price of my journey, and asked if l could pay on the train (thinking l would get out of there quicker and help the poor people still in the queue, but l was told if l paid on the train it would cost me more WHY!!!!!!, Same company same journey what a rip off. GET THE TRAINS UNDER ONE COMPANY, SAME TIMETABLE, SAME PRICES WEATHER YOU BOOK ONLINE OR PAY ON THE TRAIN AND STOP THIS RIP OFF AND TOTAL CONFUSION THAT IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM.",

An hour later, they were still there and were given snacks and drinks! Not sure why I bothered paying to upgrade. I upgraded again on the return journey, which was better, but I was charged \u00a345 instead of \u00a335 and my journey was shorter, as I was going from Harrogate to Stevenage.

        "review_text": "Travelled four times in July 21 on LNER services all in first class and each time was a bit of a mixed experience. First journey from London to York was pleasant enough and on time. Seats are not as comfortable as the old trains and I also found that you could feel every bump on the track (made worse by the hard seats) much more than previously so obviously the suspension is not as solid/robust as the older stock. Catering service was ok on this first train but nothing more than a sandwich, crisps and biscuits with tea, coffee, wine, water and I think they had an ale also.\n\nOn the second trip from York to Edinburgh a few days later it was the exact same catering offer, but staff seemed to come round more often on this train to offer refreshments.\n\nFrom Edinburgh to York service was appalling. Train was busy and people were in our seats although they did move when we boarded (but tables obviously not wiped clean). Catering service was non existent not even water offered until about 30 mins from our stop. Train was also 30 minutes late although they later claimed it was 29 minutes late to avoid any delay repay! When I contacted LNER about the service and delay on this train after the journey they really didn't claim any responsibility.\n\nFourth journey from York back to London was same food offering although was surprised that the introduction of a bacon roll suddenly appeared on this service. I've also noticed that staff are keen to 'close everything up' far too early upon getting close to London (i.e. 45-60 minutes out), presumably so they can all be first off the train. Also the train we were originally booked on they had changed and so email from LNER said we could book seat reservation on any service that day however on board it felt like an interrogation from ticket inspector as to why we were not travelling on the train booked and he asked me to to prove the email sent!  \n\nOverall very mixed experience with some journeys better than others. Appreciate things have changed in Covid times but first class catering and service really needs improving.",

My other journeys in the past I have had multiple hot food and snacks and plentiful refills of beverages which made the extra expense good value.\nI\u2019m sure LNER will blame \u201cCOVID\u201d at their lack of hospitality, but my suspicion is that it\u2019s a great excuse to give sub-standard service but still charge all the money!\nFingers crossed Virgin come back to serve the London to Scotland line again soon!",

There was no staff around yo say anything. Eventually the lady moved but she wasn't happy about it. Also having booked her seat in the supposedly quiet coach she said it is noisier than any train sh has been on. Now we regularly use Lner to travel up and down to see family in London but after today we might consider using other modes of transport. Even though we booked in August we might be changing our mind. Regards @glennyboy847",

Having frequented the Virgin first class many times I had fairly low expectations which were significantly exceeded.\n\nStaff were warm, welcoming, engaging and funny.  WiFi actually worked for the entire journey too!\n\nSeats & seating arrangements\n- All passengers were spaced appropriately and socially distanced \n- seats were clean & comfortable \n- windows were clean and there were plenty of spaces for luggage \n\nFood & Drink service \n- first class trolleys came round every 15-20 minutes with reminders between that the bar car was open \n- there was no shortage of anything and so no disappointments \n- I loved that the bar car now has an \u2018order from your seat\u2019 option meaning less people walking around \n- food was good - sandwiches actually tasted like sandwiches :-) \n- cold drinks were actually cold and tea was piping hot and served with a \u2018watch out, it\u2019s hot\u2019 warning \n\nToilets & cleaning \n- toilets were clean and regularly cleaned throughout the journey \n- between each trolley service there was a member of staff who came round to pick up any rubbish and clean anything which needed cleaning.  This included the toilets which were genuinely sparkling.  \n\nWhat a great service and at a good price too.  We will be back!",

Staff also ignored the blocking of aisles, as previously stated BTP were contacted but didn\u2019t arrive within even an hour. The fact remains there was no intervention, support or assistance provided by LNER for those of us who follow the rules.

With my Lanyard and Staff ID around my neck and children with tickets, I was told to STILL pay \u00a3127 for tickets ALTHOUGH, I was given permission to board LNER Train from Peterborough to Lindon. Question: LNER, is it because of commission why this staff member acted so mean towards another individual who ALSO works with an express train company? LNER, are you aware of the humiliation that your staff member had done to another individual who works within the railway? I was lead to walk the breadth of your train with your RO in search of her own colleague who said I can use the train for work and even after pointing out the individual to her, I was still told to pay \u00a3127.\n\nLNER, by compulsory, I have to take your train to Peterborough tomorrow and I am dreadful of this humiliation repeating. I will do a special prayer in hoping that I wont see uour RO (Anne/Ann) and I hope the commission from the \u00a3127 goes a long way for her.\n\nPeace!",

The service wasn't all that and the choice of food (roll, crisps and drink) certainly wasn't 1st class! Whilst I appreciate we are in a pandemic, I find it appalling you can offer 1st class seats at those prices when there is nothing first class about it! I was desperate for a ticket thus why I had to book 1st class but I won't be again and I certainly wouldn't recommend at those prices! The service was ok but again not what I was expecting.

I, like a lot of people this year have been more anxious than usual travelling by train.  I travelled up north last weekend on Grand Central in 1st class, no catering but a pleasant enough journey.  I then booked another last minute cheap deal for a 1st class ticket with LNER to return to London.  The next day it was all over national news channels not to travel as cracks were found in a new model of trains and services were severely disrupted.  I called the LNER customer support and received honest and empathetic advise from their staff.  After confirming on the phone that the train I had booked on would still be running, I decided to travel and boarded the train at North Allerton.  Almost immediately after finding my seat I was received by very professional staff and given food drinks and a variety of snacks.  The train wasn't overcrowded and I broke a personal speed record - from boarding the train, to opening my flat door (Deptford) in bang on 3 hours!  Can't ask for much more from a train operator, I'm looking forward to my next journey with you!",

Basically said I\u2019d purchased a ticket that gave me a seat, any food and drink is a free amenity and not part of the ticket price which is ludicrous when they advertise the food and drink as part of the 1st class experience. \n\nI forwarded that response to the Chairman\u2019s office and was contacted by an assistant in that office who wanted to speak on the phone. We had a good conversation and he said the original response was poor and he offered to send me two open first class vouchers to be used for any journey on LNER. \n\nWell they never came.  I sent a gentle nudging reminder in Feb 20 and he said he ensure they would be sent out.  Still never arrived.  Tried again in June, again he promised to send them out.  Still never arrived so I\u2019ve given up.  \n\nShame they couldn\u2019t actually follow up on what was promised as a resolution.\n\nEDIT- Dec 20, out of the blue some free tickets arrived, presumably as a result of this review.

Ordinarilly travelling on the coach which National Express abandoned as it had the rails, leaving but only dirty filthy StageCoach [CityLink] MegaBus, but I having been maimed if not crippled on ubiquitous enumerable potholes, loose chippings, aggregate, farmers muck, filth & animals that shouldn't be on the roads, were they too, like those uncivil servents Clownty Clowncil(or)s couldn't even manage that.\n\nAs it was. The train journey south was excellent. But a NIGHTMARE RETURN. Having   PRE-BOOKED   D I R E C T   T R A I N. One SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PREAMUTRELY ALIGHT Not even for essential maintenance. This, at WAVERLEY, be pointed, with a grunt, belch & fart, hobble on to ever so empathetic HAYMARKET having left pathetic Waverley in excrutiating pain & discomfort. Where upon an ever so kindly man returning home to Montrose carried my bag in addition to those two he already had. Incredulously he wouldn't even let me purchase him a coffee, let alone pay him for his struggles, as we seriously made our way across Edinburgh thru the German Fair, but bought me one too.\n\nMy sister whom arranged as such should have upon pre-booking been FOREWARNED of as such thereby FACILITATE TRAVEL ON OTHER DAYS..\n\nI was later advised LNER should have furnished a taxi?\n\nAs it was. The replacement TRAIN ARRIVED MORE THAN ONE HOUR LATE A inverA R S E H O L E S.\n\nI should have arrived at a reasonable not unreasonable hour. Incomforrt & relaxed. Not stressed, in further discomfort & pain. Compounded by LNER.\n\nNeedless to say I'VE NOT BEEN BACK ON THE TRAINS SINCE. Back in the car when I should be back on two wheels.\n\nI am perplexed as to why my experience of African & Latin Americsn rails & roads were far better in the 3rd world than 3rd rate 'United' Kingdumb of 'Great' Britain & Ulster, European 'Union'? Could it be lack of governmental subsidies?\n\nAnd everytime I write to LNER, their AUTOMOTONS send automated responses and/or fob me off. Ostensibly purporting they cannot comprehend what I have wrote  & used to many brackets & puns?\n\nWhen I should, a year later be looking forward to visiting my sister & nieces, I have foreboding.  Any wonder she whom would ordinarilly avoid inverMESS like c19 never once travelling to visit post 2005 other than to assist with relocation, now travels by 4\u00d74 & not LNER.\n\nAnd inverDEPLORABLES rail Station? As  D I S F U N C T I O N A L   as is dirty filthy ScotRail & notably LNER.\n\nAs is the CON{(ned)demned)sumer  liaison and/or aftercare(LESS).\n\nThis in total contrast to when my train broke down @ Peterborough (along the same line) in the late 1980's when then British Rail, was robbed and/or mugged at London Euston & signal failure at Milton Keynes caused me to miss my interview at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Bletchley Park, but at least Mr Peter PARKER, the Chair of BR, as a gesture of goodwill, gave me an unlimited, free gratis return ticket to travel by train on BR. Strangely enough my one & only complaint with BR.\n\nLamentably since then I have had enumerable complaints with disfunctional deplorable privatised rail companies, whom ever their owners were and/or are. Notably Scotrail & former owners of this franchise, National Express (but not their coach company, whom no longer travel to inverDEPLORABLES, because of just that)  not exemplary Virgin whom I believe no longer run trains.\n\nNow await overly, censorious Trust Pilot to remove it...'He who pays the piper calls the tune?' Old British Proverb.\n\nBring back (under invested) British Rail",

        "review_text": "We travelled on 15 October and cannot understand why people find the Azuma trains uncomfortable. We travelled from London to Edinburgh and found the trains were more comfortable in every way than the old trains and reached our destination feeling refreshed.\nHowever there are 2 criticisms. First the luggage racks were too small. We virtually filled the only rack in our carriage with just two peoples luggage. We were lucky the trains were almost empty. Second storing bikes upright is impractical and is impossible for bikes with fat tyres. We had to wheel ours in which left part of the rear wheel sticking out. Because of the difficulty cramming the bikes in we got in other passengers way and were still putting them away when the train departed.\nClearly there should be a lot more storage space, which could be used to help space passengers if designed intelligently.\nFinally I was surprised to see that the person working in the buffet was not protected by a screen despite having to stand very close to customers.\nUpdated 4September 2021. Travelled again and changed my mind there seemed to be enough luggage space, the seats although hard are very comfortable with plenty of leg room and we arrived on time much less tired than with the old intercity 125s or the west coast line. Helpful staff. The train was spotless.",

It was not until I came home that I found the LNER website which said 'light refreshments'.  We needed to know this before starting the journey so that we could buy something on the station prior to leaving.  Also, with 3 crew changes of up to 3 staff, there was no 1st Class 'at table' service.  The staff were always at the far end of the galley passing the time away. On the way up to Glasgow, Avanti West Coast, X Country Trains, and whilst on our trip on the 'The Jacobite' all provided at least an 'at seat' 'hot snacks' service with a  'Gluten Free' alternative, and they did so with less staff! This only gets a 1* review because the trains were fast. We will think twice next time!",

        "review_text": "CYCLE STORAGE\n4 of us travelled from London to Newcastle on fri11th sept and back from Berwick to Edinburgh on tues 15th sept. We were impressed by the train - smooth and fast travel with good social distancing. We did think that the guard should have gone through the train, as there was no one to check whether folk were wearing masks. \nHowever the cycle storage was the worst we have ever encountered!! It was extremely difficult to lift the cycles up and get them on the hooks provided. There was hardly room to squeeze two bikes in and no chance of shutting the door of the storage area once the cycles were in. Why was there a door there anyway?  Apparently there have been similar complaints by other cyclists, so we hope there will be a change soon.",

NO WI FI, no staff coming through to ask. Seats uncomfortable as they are very rigid and at a horrible angle. What a massive disappointment. So much for social distancing- everyone in our carriage is crammed at one end with lots of feee seats at the front part of the carriage. I will not be travelling LNER again if I can avoid it. It\u2019s daylight robbery taking people\u2019s money for no service. All dressed up as COVID avoidance measures. Really?? If you can  eat in a restaurant why not on a train?  Very poor  LNER.",

The first class fare didn\u2019t even include a sandwich, all the way from Edinburgh to London , and was told we had to pay for this at the cafe at other end of train. A complete joke! They can\u2019t offer first class fare a sandwich because of \u2018Covid\u2019 but the party of four males beside us defied the Face mask Rule and staff didn\u2019t seem to care.

Train was clean and on time, as per most places, there was little customer adherance to Covid rules despite regular announcements. But the seats, oh my god the seats. The designers previous job must have been torturing people. Hard, bolt upright, no support for lower back, however hard i tried it was impossible to get comfy. Did nobody actually try these seats out before putting them on their entire fleet of trains? I overheard others on the train saying similar things. The old train seating was far better, i use to catch these trains which were formerly virgin as i enjoyed the ride. That sadly is no longer the case and ill prob try one of the other operators.",

Mainly, this was illustrated by the fact that whatever is happening at the point of online ticket booking does not, in any shape or form, distribute tickets according to the 2metre (or even Im+, if we're going to get picky) rule. This is even more unacceptable when a stroll through the train once we were on our way, revealed some carriages with hardly any travellers in them at all. Some passengers were considerate and sensible enough to wear masks. Many were not. The odd tannoy announcement regarding face coverings coming late in the journey (the first ones failed to mention the mask protocal) simply comes across as token gesture and indifferent. One member of the crew passed speedily through the carriage enroute but seemed to be in a hurry. I guess if you pretend not to see a violation of mask-wearing instructions, then you can pretend it's just not happening. Also, it was incredibly hot and many were bemoaming the lack of air -conditioning. This may well have been a Covid-related health and safety issue thing, I suppose. In which case, at least have the common courtesy to let your customers know. In short, a horrible stressful experience.",

They are also quite noisy in the seating areas, certainly nowhere near as quiet as HST's were (HST's were trains introduced in 1976/1978 and finally withdrawn from service late 2019).",

All at full price first class.\nIve used the east coast route for years and they have done well in the past. This was shabby and the seats arent too comfortable on these trains either. The blurb boasts that these are their best trains yet. What a load of tosh.\nVirgin knew how to run a proper train service, this line has become a waste of money. The 225s and 125s are much more comfortable and smooth riding. But most importantly, no food and no staff mean a dismal service. I find the quality on a full train is lacking too with food and staff cut backs. A poor service overall nowadays. They should be shamed for charging these farea, hotels wouldnt get away with it and many of them are nowhere near first class but they are all better than this. \nAbsolutely shoddy.",

I couldn't pay and I was asked to pay a penalty until 2 extremely kind passengers offered to make up the 6 pound difference I was missing. I have never known my all routes ticket to be invalid on a train before. The ticket guard was only doing her job and was pleasant to speak to, and told me that LNER has the most uneccesary restrictions than any other service, why is this? I will take every opportunity to avoid your service at all costs. Awful. Sort it out.",

The First Class seats in the Azuma are noticeably closer together in terms of legroom - I estimate 20cm less legroom per seat.  The tables are also less deep, as a result.  If you are sitting opposite someone, you are constantly kicking each other.  LNER have also reduced the number of First seats from 128 to 101 - so the First Class carriages were very full.  (Standard class was not that full at all (they added 100 seats to Standard class.)  The new First class seats are also pretty firm to sit on.  \nLNER should increase the legroom again. And also the number of seats.   \nThey have also reduced the size of the caf\u00e9 bar by about 65% - it is now a joke.\nThe coffee machine was out of order; and they have de-programmed it from being able to produce espresso.  (Why would anyone do that?!)\nThe oven for First Class food also packed up. \nNot a great Azuma first time experience!!!",

The old seats are so much more comfortable.  \n\nWho on earth signed these off as remotely acceptable?",

        "review_text": "Like so many other reviewers, I was really looking forward to the arrival of the new Azuma trains. How very disappointing they have turned out to be.\n\nStandard class is dreadful, the seats are SO uncomfortable, too upright and SO hard. The leg room is improved however, but you need this as you can't stop wriggling trying to get comfortable. The last journey I took was from Harrogate to London Kings Cross. The train arrived but with no external signage illuminated, so we were unable to tell which carriage we were boarding. Once on board, there were mixed opinions from other passengers about which carriage we were actually in, and as the seat reservations had failed to load up, we were unable to tell if we were in reserved seats or not. \n\nA trip to the toilet (large and clean) was spoiled as there was no water to wash my hands.\n\nNo trolley service throughout my trip.\n\nFirst class accomodation is also a disappointment as the first class seats now feel more like the old standard class seats 'recycled !\n\nOn my last trip in first class there were no menus, so had to ask what food was available. I dont know if this a new cost cutting policy, or just a one of oversight ? \n\nBring back the old trains please.",

Colleague said all trains heading south cancelled, 4 new trains put on. 11,12,1& 2pm. Go down you should get one. If not they will sort accommodation for this eve and travel out tomorrow. Get to station. All trains cancelled. Station closed. 1 poor female colleague fending off 100s of queries. Asked what is happening. She didn\u2019t really know other than station closed and no trains. Come back tomorrow?  Asked about overnight. Said it\u2019s not up to her to arrange my hotel!  Stood in rain with family of five. Hotels loving it wanting \u00a3300 plus for a room. No help from LNER. People saying Twitter saying one thing, website saying another and colleague at the gate saying even less. One thing for certain, all different messages. One would think the management could manage this situation better. Not looking forward to tomorrow as I expect even more chaos. Shocking service, shocking communication. Shocking LNER. Whilst I understand they cannot control the weather, surely they are big enough to establish some pre set contingencies. Bad Weather is not something new.  Read your passenger commitments/mission statement. Not one element applied to my plight.",

The food and drinks served in 1 st class is great ,I had a tastey Beef stew and Yorkshire pudding and a little dessert . The service was great and value for money . The 1st class lounge at London King's Cross was great with newspaper and complimentary  drinks and snacks I recommend the Hot Chocolate and biscuits. I was on route to Bradford on this occasion changing at Leeds .The only slight dissatisfaction is that there isn't a more direct LNER direct services to Bradford as it's a great value for money place to stay with good selection of attractions and places to eat.

My son was traveling from Newcastle to Edinburgh, he arrives early for his train and goes to the platform given . A LNER train to Edinburgh arrives 5 minutes early, he understandably gets on\n , thinking it may stay in the station a few minutes. When the ticket collector comes around he gives him his ticket ..... apparently he is on the wrong LNER train, his is 5 minutes behind, this train is a DELAYED TRAIN which should have passed through Newcastle earlier.  Now the bewildering part , the \ncollector then proceeds to make him pay 38 UK pounds for the journey, no option of getting off at the next station to get his train , no options at all , my son being very polite and not at all assertive PAYS !!! He is a student, he has to work a whole night till 3.30 am to earn that money and now is in Edinburgh without any money !!! Is this a win for LNER , is the collector rewarded , he must feel pretty pleased with himself???\n Reply \n\nSorry to hear this Mark. However, your son did agree to the terms and conditions when buying his ticket to travel on that booked service and the onus is on the customer to ensure they board the correct train. ^KM\nMy reply \n\nIf the board says platform number and your train arrives  going to the same destination,  a few minutes early , what would you think/do ???? How is he to know it\u2019s the wrong train?\nReply \n\nThe Departure Boards will confirm what train is on that platform, and announcements will be made on-board and at the station, Mark. ^KM\nMy reply \n\nWell we both know that is not always the case . Same train company, same platform, same destination... few minutes early, are you joking ??\n\nSo he had to pay twice to the same company for the same journey because your train was late ??\nReply \n\nIf you're unhappy with this, you can contact Customer Services on 03457 225 333 or at customers@lner ^KM\nWe will , although judging by your attitude I\u2019m not sure customer service is your business",

        "review_text": "Travelled York to Kings Cross first class in November & back second class in December. Seats are absolutely dire in both & staff had no ideas about where we should put our luggage on either journey. Going down, 71 year old husband had to lift 2 large heavy cases to head height. Coming back they had to be left by the exit doors along with 10 other cases( automated messages about leaving doors clear of little use as nowhere to put them. We did put them on the side that wouldn't be opened before we got off). Return journey unable to access any food as buffet car would only accept cash, no cards. Miserable journeys, not worth the money & the older trains were always more comfortable. The much vaunted arrival of Azuma is a PR disaster...did anyone actually try sitting on one on a journey before being ordered? I presume not....",

In many cases I have chosen to sit on the floor in the vestibule as the carpet is more comfortable. The ride is rattly and the aircon noisy and too cold, it's like travelling in a tinny box. Far too little luggage space leading to cases blocking doors, gangways and seats at very busy times. The automated safety announcements are irritating. When two 5 car trains are coupled together you can't walk between them, causing issues with accessing the buffet or empty seats if you get on the busy set.\n\nIt is really difficult to find anything nice to say at all. They are basically glorified short-distance commuter trains running long distance services. Way more uncomfortable than a modern private car, coach or plane. This is not Inter-City quality, it's cheap and nasty travel at premium prices.\n\nSo disappointed that the East Coast route has been ruined by this tat. I'll drive whenever possible and would not recommend anyone I know to choose to travel on these trains.",

The seating layout is also unacceptable favouring single travellers and parties of 4 whilst leaving  couples to fight over the ONE table plus two facing seats per carriage. The toilets are dreadfully cramped and their facities poorly designed.  Noise levels and luggage facilities are both poor.\nWe have few criticisms of the service in first class and have had some very acceptable gastronomic offerings. \nIt would be however good to see LNER own up to the mistakes they have made or have inherited rather than continually trumpeting that our lives will be transformed by their very poor new trains.",

        "review_text": "I travelled first class on the 08:00 hours Edinburgh to London train on the 2nd January 2020. Prior to purchasing my ticket, I visited the LNER website because I know that the food offered to first class passengers is \"complimentary\" which lets LNER 'off the hook' should they fail to serve the advertised menu for any spurious reason.\n\nThe website stated that on 2nd January, I \"would get the same great breakfast but only be offered sandwiches at any other time of the day\" owing to the Christmas and New Year holiday.   As I was travelling on the 08:00 hours train, I expected to be served the full English Breakfast in accordance with the information advertised on the website.  Instead, I was offered a Turkey and Cranberry sandwich and was told that the supplies for breakfast had not been delivered. I informed the Attendant that I had been told by an LNER Senior Executive that supplies could be brought on board any train at either Newcastle or York so there was no excuse for just being offered a sandwich that had been left over from Christmas.  I was told that staff \"would try to get some bacon rolls brought on to the train at Newcastle.\"  At Newcastle, bacon rolls were brought on the train. I am at a loss to understand why the full range of eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns, baked beans and toast could not be delivered to the train at Newcastle so that customers could be served the advertised Full English Breakfast. I should imagine that the staff did not want to have the trouble of cooking breakfasts on board so they used the excuse of non availability supplies to explain the situation. Whoever is responsible for this chronic underperformance should now consider their position and their retention in LNER's service   \n\nLNER serves first class passengers complimentary tea and coffee throughout the journey. The tea is lukewarm and not refreshing because it is served from a push top flask. The water for tea must be boiling.  By contrast, standard class passengers can buy tea from the buffet car at the correct temperature. Why pay for a first class ticket when you will receive inferior quality food and beverages to those offered to passengers in standard class? What a state of affairs! \n\nI travelled first Class on the 1200 hours London to Edinburgh train on the 7th January, 2020. The food offer, on this occasion, amounted to a few spoonfuls, (and I mean two spoonfuls) of stew with a shop bought Yorkshire pudding. There is no point in having a celebrity chef as \"poster boy\" for such a miserable meal.    \n\nThe seats on the new Azuma Trains are back breaking on a four hour 20 minute journey. Inadequate luggage storage facilities were a constant problem for the train crew to manage throughout the journey. First class passengers have no access to the standard class buffet car on the new Azuma Trains as the first class kitchen which serves poor quality food and lukewarm tea impedes passengers from walking the length of the train to purchase acceptable refreshments from the buffet counter.",

Having missed one train while queuing we boarded the next which was completely full with people standing in corridors, aisles and anywhere they could. \nOn arrival at Newcastle I went NBC to the ticket office to change my tickets to its class for the return fearing a repeat of the its journey with shopping. No allowance was made for not using the standard class return and had to pay the full single journey 1st class fare. Not a problem as it\u2019s their rules. \nThe return journey was on an Azuma and this was my first journey on one. \nVery disappointing. Not as comfortable as the 225 and looked cheap and like standard class. Whether this is because LNER have chosen a cheap level of trim I don\u2019t know. \nNo complementary wine due to \u2018the festive season\u2019 but you can buy it - what\u2019s that all about. \nI shall avoid them until I have no choice.",

Just travelled first class Edinburgh to York on one of the new Azuma trains and what a downgrade!  I love train travel, and choose it over anything else, but the new Azuma fails in every respect compared to the former Virgin first class service.  Rock hard, totally unsupportive seats, (and where is the leather that used to be standard in first class?), table too high to use either for eating or a laptop, no option on the single seats to move the table out of the way, and the toilet and handwashing facilities are a disaster - tiny broom cupboard space, and guaranteed to get water everywhere except down the plug - woeful, thoughtless design.  Was this train planned by a committee?  There is no flair, no comfort, no putting the passenger first or trying to make it feel special.  It's a bus.  It\u2019s not even a luxury coach, and this is first class we are talking about!  It is all about ease of assembly, ease of maintenance and cost cutting.  And the meals?  A rock-hard bread roll masquerading as a pastry for breakfast or a yoghurt.    \n\nTHIS IS NOT FIRST-CLASS TRAVEL! It's barely third class and is probably actionable under the trade descriptions act!\n\nI will plan my future trips to avoid the Azuma at all costs, using the older trains with proper first-class facilities rather than these failed look-alikes.  What a huge disappointment, and to think that we are going to be stuck with this mess for the next thirty years doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.",

Low cost airlines may have no legroom but they seem to be able to design a thin but reasonably comfortable seat - and that's not in 1st Class.

The fabric on the seats is the main issue, the HSL carriages were leather whereas the Azuma carriages are trimmed with fabric which is already showing signs of wear and it is brand new!\n\nThe table also rises at the edge to meet the window, this is really poor design and results in spillages as people are not expecting a table not to be flat...lots of people are going to have damaged laptops over the lifetime of these carriages.\n\nThey are clean and spacious as you would expect from something brand new, but feels like a Japanese car...reliable but cheap inside.\n\nNot an upgrade...I will still travel 1st class...but it is the end of the era, I suspect we will not see luxury as we saw on the HSL carriages again.",

Yes they are both hard and without sufficient padding, but in first they are definitely designed with 5ft 10in business men in mind. If I sit with my back against the back of the seat, my feet don't reach the floor !  I'm not tall but I'm not that short.  Sitting like that for 2 hours is B**** uncomfortable. Sure it;s nice to sit in a new clean train rather than an old one with threadbare carpets and stained chairs, but it could have been so much better. It least it's not GWR - there new trains are like a glorified sprinter train, cold and with grey lighting like the first energy saving bulbs !",

People are forced to use one service and let me tell you it\u2019s appalling. I\u2019ve travelled on these trains for over 15 years and I\u2019ve seen them get worse and worse. New Azuma trains are a joke! No luggage car and one tiny luggage storage per carriage. Who thought this was ok? Clearly no one that has ever been on this particular route or maybe even on a train. Toilets that are AlWAYS dirty and run out of tissue and always have wet, dirty floors. New Azuma toilets are impossible for older people to open, and no were to change a baby that I saw on the whole train? Small uncomfortable seats with no room for belongings and plugs that you have to get to by feeling up your next door neighbours bum. Going to Edinburgh? Just fly it\u2019s cheaper and more pleasant - and that\u2019s saying something \ud83d\ude02 LNER are pure money grabbers with not a care for customers or their welfare because guess what? With a monopoly they don\u2019t need to care.",

In particular:\n1. LNER from Newark to London is cheaper than Loughborough to London with EMR in nearly all cases.\n2.  You can select a seat when you book with LNER, EMR you get allocated a seat.\n3. The LNER station platforms are marked so you know where to stand for your carriage.  A litle thing but pretty basic & very useful.\n4. The new LNER trains are a massive upgrade on anything EMR has.  For starters, they pull away from the station without constant jerking & slopping of coffee.\n4. You can get a full breakfast on the morning LNER trains which isn't possible on EMR after 7.42am.\n5. Afternoon LNER trains offer free hot & cold meals & drinks, including alcohol.  These have to be paid for on EMR & in general, food quality is better on LNER than EMR.\n6. The LNER Kings Cross lounge is excellent when compared to the cramped EMR lounge at St Pancras.\n\nIn my experience, both services suffer from too many delays and cancellations but for me, LNER offers a substantially better service than the alternative EMR service which seems to be 10 years out of date.",

        "review_text": "It\u2019s really gone downhill since being taken over from Virgin Trains. I always travel first class, and although the prices haven\u2019t changed, there have been some cuts to the first class service - for example there used to be a choice of having breakfast or lunch on the 9.29 from Newcastle to London, and there used to be a bar trolley each way from around 11am. Now this is classed as a \u2018breakfast service\u2019. I\u2019m currently travelling on a that train (which is delayed by 1 hour 30 mins so far, although there was a Delay Repay announcement, so at least that\u2019s still available) and at about 12.20 I asked the coffee trolley attendant if the bar trolley was on the way, and the response was to say I could buy drinks from the bar, and even to try and upsell me champagne. I said isn\u2019t except drinks to be included when I travel first class and the response was a raised eyebrow and a laugh between him and his colleague - another example of something that hasn\u2019t changed I suppose - it\u2019s never really been first class on these trains. I\u2019m on a brand new Azuma, and have to say that at 6 foot 5, they really aren\u2019t as comfortable as the older trains. Much prefer the open feel, better legroom and nicer upholstered seats. Just not impressed. I\u2019ve always loved train travel, I even look forward to the journey, but I am going to look at flights for next time, after the last few experiences on LNER.",

        "title": "Train And Travel Buff Review Of The London And North Eastern Railway Company - Not So Good Anymore",
        "review_text": "I'll start off by sating I'm a train buff, so my review may be biased and in railways, I may overlook things that in other circumstances, I'd be irritated by.\n\nThe Standard Class Experience. (Intercity 225.)\nMuch on par with other high capacity haulers, like Virgin Trains West Coast, the level of comfort is practical and efficient but not always enjoyable, especially on a crowded train.\n\nThe First Class Experience. (Intercity 125 and 225.)\nI was on the London Kings Cross To Aberdeen \"Northern Lights\" Intercity 125 Saturday service during some line works, so the journey was to take longer than usual. I had specifically made the trip to go on the trains, so I had very high expectations. During the 10 1/4 hour trip, the service was very good. They really take good care of their first class passengers. The seats are very comfortable and roomy but as a vegetarian, I would have preferred fabric seats, though I don't know if the leather was real. As far as seats go, the best I have found are East Midlands Railway HST seats, with huge springy (original?) MK3 first class seats. Comparing the level of service to East Midlands Railway, the weekend service is far superior with LNER: tea and coffee served at the table in real cups and a wide selection of snacks. I can't speak of Virgin Trains first class, as I haven't used them, yet. I also joined the \"Highland Chieftain\" on the Inverness to Kings Cross Sunday service during the trip, again with line disruption, the service was 10 1/4 hours but was thoroughly enjoyable. Intercity 225 seats are identical, thought the MK4 coach seems to handle the track better than the older MK3. Air pressure in tunnels and when passing trains is much better as well, though not as good as the Azuma's pressurised carriage.\n\nAzuma, Class 800.\nThe Japan built Azuma or Class 800 is supposed to be the successor to the 30 year old Intercity 225 and 40 year old Intercity 125. As a devout fan of both of those classes, I don't look on the Azuma with much enthusiasm and the interior, though practical and efficient fails to deliver in terms of comfort. I am referring to the seats being rather firm. The trains themselves are reasonably aesthetic; comparable to the Pendolino, class 390 of Virgin Trains at the front/rear. The tops of the coaches and connections between lack aesthetics. They seem to handle the ruts and bumps of the track better than the carriages of the Intercity 125 or 225, which is great when walking at speed down the isle, trying to find the buffet bar. Apparently, the first class customers have complained about the seats but I find they're okay. Not as comfy as the Intercity 125 or 225 but okay. I don't know if I'd want to spend more than say five hours on them though. It's been touted that the Azuma is impervious to ear popping in tunnels but I still noticed.\nWhat I find strange is that the early Shinkansen 0 Series (Japan built) have very comfy seats (there is one in York National Railway Museum, if you want to try them,) just as the original Intercity 125. Huge springy seats, some 6 inches deep to deal with the jumping of the carriage. Yet, these new trains have such a reduction in seat comfort.\n\nCompared to East Midlands Railway.\nMuch better catering for first class customers. First Class seats better than EMR Meridian, class 222. Busier service than EMR, in general.\n\nCompared to Virgin Trains West Coast.\nVery much on par with the Pendolino. Not quite as many options as the Pendolino buffet bar but slightly better seats (Intercity 225.) Busy service, just like Virgin Trains.\n\nCompared to Cross Country.\nSomewhat superior to the Class 220/221 Voyager/Super Voyager in terms of comfort. Much better than the Class 170 Turbostar. Much better first class service. More crowded, in general.\n\nSuggestions for Customers:\nBring your own cushion if using the Azuma, your backside will thank you ;)\nEnjoy the Intercity 225 while they're still here, if you're lucky enough to get one.\n\nI'll take one star off from my four star review for the poor customer service when I was trying to get a refund for a trip. Took them a second to get my money but over a month to get it back. So, better hope the train service doesn't screw up, like the did with me because if they owe the customer money, they make it hard to give it back.\nThe poor customer service put me off, so I probably won't use LNER again and now that booking a comfortable Intercity 225 is about as hit and miss as a Musket, there isn't any point for me to travel by train.",

Some sort of electronic chime alarm every 7 seconds has been assailing our eardrums for nearly an hour and staff unable to reset it. As the LNER\u2019s latest much hyped train set it is a serious disappointment and I dread the withdrawal of the older stock in which it was possible to fall asleep. Not on these seats nor with the chicken-shed overhead fluorescent lighting will it be possible to relax. Who signed-off on this substandard product of the 21st century? They should be sentenced to travel every day for months on the ECML in an Azuma and enjoy the numb bum sensation as reward for their efforts!!!",

One small, fairly poorly cooked meal (salmon in a sauce with some vegetables - my baby daughter wouldn\u2019t have been full on it); \n\n2. A free G&T and a coke \n\n3. A hard, uncomfortable seat (the carriage was clean to be fair). \n\n4. A guard who watched me struggle to get my baby daughter in her pram on to the train and offered no help. No doubt your staff are told they can\u2019t help unless they\u2019ve had Manual Handling Regulations training and have signed a waiver because you\u2019re scared of the insurance position were they, god forbid, to hurt themselves. I mean, 6 month old babies are HEAVY. I understand that some hairdressers are now warned about the danger of scissors too.\n\nIs the extortionate price you charge your customers worth it? I think not. You\u2019ve got so much more to do to justify the fare.\n\nThe only positive is that the rest of the train crew were very polite and helpful and seemed to work hard.",

I received a confirmation email saying that tickets would be with me in 2 hours.\nNo tickets arrived. I waited beyond the 2 hours .but still nothing arrived. This was now the evening only 1 day before travelling. I didn\u2019t want to risk another error from Virgin/LNER so bought tickets on an alternative route. I contacted Virgin/LNER to ask for a refund only to be told that a \u00a310 fee would be charged on each ticket. Given that I had paid for tickets which never even arrived this transaction felt more like theft.\nThe amount of money is not greatly significant but I am amazed that \n(a) I have since (2 months later!) been refused a refund and \n(b) I have not received any explanation at all for the tickets not being sent.",

The power plugs under there seats didn't work, no power : just like the old trains. But unlike the older train we now have harsh LED lighting In the ceiling which is permanently switched on inducing a headache-fuelled glow to unflatteringly play across the greasy angry faces of passengers queuing for the toilet. I would say toilet(s) but there was only one working in my 5 carriage stretch of the train. 1 toilet. \n\nThe food trolley doesn't accept cards. \n\nThe toilet are -of course- a mess when we pulled out of Edinburgh.

        "review_text": "Due to a fault on the LNER website, when I booked 2 return tickets to London on 8th July this year, the system duplicated my booking and so I received tickets for 4 people and of course paid double the fare. The mistake only came to light when I went to collect my tickets and I was advised to phone LNER Customer Services. I did this and spoke to a very helpful woman who told me to post the tickets to her department and a refund would be issued within 14 working days. Why on earth do I have to wait all this time for my money (over \u00a3100) to be refunded when this was the fault of LNER? I sent the tickets by recorded delivery and, almost 2 weeks later, have not had any acknowledgment that they've been received. NOT IMPRESSED!",

Has this really became a third world country backwards of anything you\u2019ll see on the continent or are all profits going to shareholders? The shrill voice making unnecessary over announcements on the tannoy about keeping aisles unblocked, where to place tickets for inspection represents all that is wrong about this nanny state.  Shoehorned into a seat without a working plug, unable to charge my laptop or do any work. The incessant chatter of annoying Americans and upper class students from the home counties on their way to the Edinburgh Fringe makes for an unpleasant experience.",

I had never even heard of Azuma trains and assumed it was the same as GNER.  \nI explained this was highly unfair especially after the guard at the station had confirmed I was on the correct train.\nMy pleas fell on deaf ears and I was forced to leave my ID and will be sent a bill which I will be fighting tooth and nail! Surely the guard could have showed some leniency in these circumstances. Azuma trains do you think I purposely got on your train knowingly? There are way too many companies on these lines and it is really confusing which train is which. Creating confusion = rip off customers! \ud83d\ude21",

        "review_text": "Where do I start? The sets are comfortable on the old style trains in 1st class but that's an end to the good points.\nThe food is abysmal. Hubby had a pork in cider option but discovered 2 huge lumps of pure fat mixed in with the 'meat'. I had sweet potato curry as there was only one pork option left (thank god) but it was equally uninspiring. Tasted like it came from the 'budget' range in a cheap supermarket microwave meal aisle.\nI have discovered on Twitter that LNER have been shortlisted for a 'Caterer of the Year' award. Who the hell is giving the award? Have they ever actually TASTED the food? I don't think so. We were disappointed but could have possibly forgiven LNER for the food had it not been for the toilets!\n2 toilets had 'out of order' signs on them and were locked. Another 2 toilets had no toilet paper or paper towels whatsoever and were totally blocked almost to the rims and stinking to high heaven. People had resorted to using red paper serviettes but still there was a floor swimming in urine and an awful stench of excrement. Highly unhygienic. \nI dread what tourists from other countries think when they experience these conditions on a first class ticket in Britain. It was an utter waste of money and we won't be doing it again.",

The standard seats are much less comfortable than the older trains Azuma was meant to improve. The first class seats are obviously better than standard but the carriages are more crowded than the older trains, so there's much less personal space. I'm stuck on an immobile Azuma train as I write this review (a commonplace experience, as I commute between Leeds and London weekly). Despite today being the hottest day of the year so far (38 celciius) the air conditioning is faulty in this carriage. This is the return part of my journey - my outbound LNER train had faulty air-conditioning units in four of its carriages this morning. I accept that the hot weather has caused today's service delay; I don't accept the avoidable discomfort that the 'delay repay' scheme cannot compensate me for. Shoddy shoddy service and definitely not worth the advertising hype.",

The only time LNER staff was seen giving them a warning was at the very beginning of the trip, whilst checking the tickets. For the rest of the trip they where swearing, shouting and getting increasingly intoxicated without any further warning from staff, and sadly no other passenger on the coach had the courage or authority to silence or detrain them.\nAs most of them left at Newcastle, the seats, the tables were covered in bottles, alcohol and other rubbish. Two families whose paid assigned seats from Newcastle were located in the middle of the mess, had to clean the whole place and dry the seats in order to start their trip - there were no alternative seats around.\nSome from the 'ned' party were left behind on the train, as they did not manage to get off the train in time. So they spent the time till the next stop smoking on the train near the doors.

Our train was packed so tightly that we couldn\u2019t even get into our car and there was no staff around to do anything about it or direct the passengers. Again, to be fair, they had to change trains from electric to diesel so needed a new crew, but there was absolutely no one around to talk to. We and some others decided that we would go to the first class cars where someone would be sure to get things done, and we weren\u2019t wrong. The poor crew there was apparently not supposed to be there any more but their company had done nothing about that either. The crew told us we couldn\u2019t stand in the spaces between cars, but when we told them we had no other choice they left us alone. The train was delayed 40 minutes as they tried to change crews and the only advice we got from staff was \u201crisk is part of life, try the 12 o\u2019clock train!\u201d There was no chance we were going anywhere that was even less of a guarantee, so we stayed put. We spent the next two hours with our young children between first class cars sitting on our luggage or standing, having to cram together to let people on and off. The only saving grace was a few staff members who gave our kids some of the first class snacks and explained to other crew why we were there, or otherwise left us alone. \nAt one stop a gentlemen with some disabilities got on with difficulty only to find that his reserved first class seat and all others were taken. He ended up having to stand near us with his crutches and fell hard during a rough turn! Eventually he got a seat, but seriously, what the hell?!\nEventually the throngs thinned and we were able to make our way back to coach and found some seats together. The seats were nice enough but there was no air movement and it was definitely warm. No one ever came by in coach to pick up trash either. On the upside, the staff after changeover was very pleasant and fun, and prices for much needed drinks were reasonable for a train. \nThroughout the trip the train manager through the loud speaker kept announcing that we could put in for reimbursement due to late travel. That process was painful as well. You have to do each ticket individually (we had 4) with loads of information and it says it will save your information from one to the next. It doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s no commitment as to what the compensation will be either. I will try to edit this review when I see the results. \nAll in all, LNER provided a crappy travel experience for many people that day. The only upside was a few of the staff members, so 2 stars.",

When we found some staff to support us, they put us in first class instead (as the train wasn't stopping until London by this time) and gave us sandwiches, cakes and tea. The staff acknowledged that these people had pinched our seats but chose to deal with it this way. They were very helpful and attentive - particularly the lady with the smart red uniform on the food trolley! - and we got to travel first class. Very nice!",

I am now on my return journey no announcement until the train departed 15 minutes late due to faulty doors. I only caught my ongoing train by the skin of my teeth. To add insult to injury the toilets near my compartment were marked for staff only all in all not a pleasant experience and the seats are so close together and rigid there seems no cushioning at all I will be checking which train I will be travelling with in the future or maybe just take my car. I was really excited when I saw the train pulling into the station on Friday and thought this should be state of the art travel, what a disappointment. I am a very unhappy customer.",

We explained (among a whole bunch of other passengers) the track had not been announced without any effect.\nBecause the 14:00 was delayed so much, we also missed the 14:30.\nNext one was the 15:00. We tried to book that one in the ticket office, but the employee could not do that. Did not explain why. We twisted an arm of another employee to tell us which track to go, to avoid the 14:00 train experience. We succeeded to board the train\nOnly to find out we were going to be charged another \u00a318,05 each, because our tickets were only valid for train's that were cancelled (13:30), not announced on time (14:00) or missed because of the delay of the train that had not been announced (14:30).

My refund was \u00a335. so in addition to that I thought that was fair.

Actually costing \u00a310 rather than a whole new ticket ( as per conversation with previous 2 - both women) who said i had to buy a new ticket costing \u00a3114 ' if i wanted to get on their train's. '. Thank you to this gentleman who was happy to help me. There were many empty seats on all 3 trains and certainly no need for me to wait another hour for my booked train. I was seated at a table for 4 alone all the way from Leeds to kings Cross.\nVery upsetting experience for a lady travelling alone. Wished I'd driven my car and not listened to all the adverts on TV showing what a wonderful experience travelling by train can be.",

Due to a family emergency had to take an earlier train - had a full price ticket on a half empty train but they wouldn't accept it and said we needed new tickets at the premium price they have for purchasing on the train.\u00a3180 later we had valid tickets.\n\nI have just witnessed an inspector 'stinging' a poor young student for over \u00a3140 because he had left his rail card a home. He could prove he had an 18-25 rail card via his mail but the inspector refused to look at it.  Where is the common decency? The poor lad was nearly in tears as he couldn't afford it. The original ticket they said was void was just for \u00a345 but they required \u00a3140. \n\nWhen will the regulators put a stop to this dynamic pricing with different prices on the train, on the internet and at the ticket office etc? It's time the regulators put a stop to this cynical profiteering.",

        "review_text": "Bad experience today. Paid \u00a382 for a return to London, had to buy it on a Transpennine Train as the station systems down, with my railcard. It was a super off peak, the conductor who sold it didn't know the,  conditions, and asking in London railways in the past I've been told peak was only in the morning. Took a train from KingsX to York, and was told my ticket was invalid after the train left, there was an inaudible announcement a few minutes before leaving which apparently mentioned off peak tickets, I didn't hear it.  Was charged over \u00a3200 for the revised ticket, told I could not use my railcard (LNER conductors cannot accept railcards apparently, only other train companies can) and this was the difference in price between what I paid.  It is extremely difficult to check the arcane rules for these tickets, information from station staff isn't consistent, and this train was no doubt purposefully set to leave at 1600 the start of the peak period.  I was shocked, and I will never travel on LNER again.  Even the staff on the train were embarrassed by what they were being asked to do, and passengers also recounted how their experience is also that it is impossible to be sure of what rules are attached to different tickets.  Thank you LNER for wrecking my trip.  But don't worry you won't have another opportunity to do so.",

On the way up, I figured the beef rendang curry might suit my dietary requirements - it came with literally 3 small cubes of beef, and 17 cubes of potato (yes I counted).\nThe staff were friendly to be fair, and it was nice to get free alcohol which I am currently drowning my sorrows with.

Though my coach ran out of toilet rolls so have to go to another coach. In terms of rating to give:\n1. Departure/Arrival times: 9/10\n2. Booking/Seat and updates: 10/10\n3. Cleanliness: 8/10\n4. On Board Services: 9/10\n5. Staff friendliness/help: 8/10\n\nThanks.",

The last 3 journeys booked with LNER have failed to get us all the way to our destinations, due to late LNER trains and connections missed. First Class service has become so dire I shall no longer be using LNER. Staff attitude to passengers is a disgrace, they seem to think they are doing you a favour by allowing you on their train. Missed a connection at Kings Cross due to late train into Paddington (all tickets booked with LNER) all the LNER information man could tell me was that I had missed my train, he was so helpful he pointed to my ticket another 3 times and told me the same thing. The service I boarded, had about 4 people in my First Class coach, however only a cold drink and an egg sandwich and the bag of crisps was offered and that was the last we saw of the catering staff, they must have been busy, chatting I presume, as there was hardly anyone on the service and very little to do. Couldn't possibly revisit the passengers AGAIN. On a service to London had to order breakfast 3 times, due to the order being forgotten twice and then given to someone else. I shall be using Hull Trains or East Midlands services from now on. I can forgive breakdowns and equipment failures but RUDE LAZY INCONCIDERATE staff I cannot. The staff uniforms are now scruffy, ill fitting and in most cases dirty, usually a good indicator of what to expect from any service provider.

        "review_text": "Completely unreliable - quite often 10, 20 minutes late like it\u2019s no big deal. Also the non-peak trains sometimes don\u2019t appear to have working suspension - and the whole carriage is stoically trying to pretend they are happy sitting there with their tea slopping over the sides of the cup because the train is bouncing so much. This happens a lot on the later quieter trains, not so much on the busier commuter trains. What else? Well there\u2019s the issue of feet on seats - happens much less in first class but I do see happening regularly  in Standard Class. Why don\u2019t staff simply issue the culprit with a \u00a350 on-the-spot fine? Very easy to do and most travellers hate feet on seats and would support this. It\u2019s a no-brainer - just like the type of people who put their feet on seats!!",

        "review_text": "Use LNER regularly between Stonehaven and London first class instead of flying.  Catering rules differ on each journey I have taken with lousy communication about how it works. Not exactly airline business meal service. More budget airline attitude at times.  Doesn't reflect the price. It could be so easy to communicate how often hot meals are served. Had one head of catering avoid me after first hot meal. I don't think it's too much to ask for a bit more on a 6 hour 40 min journey. So from my journeys this is what I have learnt:\n\n1. If you take a breakfast on leaving Kings Cross you won't  get lunch. In fact you will be told you can't  have lunch because you had breakfast. The next hot meal service is available after Newcastle.\n\n2. Toast is served in the mornings. Take this instead of the breakfast and you will get a hot lunch before Newcastle.\n\n3. If the service gets disrupted then often catering will be limited depending on the nature of the disruption and where it occurred.\n\n4. On weekends the food is generally more freely available.\n\nBasically my advice is to ask the catering staff about the availability of hot food. It is not always clear and seems to vary. It would be better for Lner to just state or publish on their menu how often a hot snack is available. The crews that tavel between Edinburgh and Aberdeen are far more understanding of this issue.",

I used Trainline and was able to book seats on the outbound journey but was told the inbound train was unreservable and there would be plenty vacant seats. When we arrived at Kings Cross to return to Scotland we found that this was not the case and almost all the seats were reserved . We tried to get a seat on three different trains to no avail. The ticket office were no help amd advised us that we should try to get a seat in first class and pay an upgrade . We eventually had to do this as we had visions of never getting a standard seat home. I have complained to LNER and Trainline and all they do is blame each other and are not interested in compensating. LNER won\u2019t entertain a complaint because we didn\u2019t have reserved seats.. THAT\u2019S  BECAUSE THEY WOULDN\u2019T LET US BOOK SEATS. Dreadful customer service that would have us try all day to get a train home. I will never book or travel LNER again and would advise people not to book a trip and believe that the advice that seats are unreservable .

        "review_text": "I haven't even been on the service yet but if their customer call centre is anything to go by - I can't say I'm looking forward to it.\n\nLet me begin by saying that I TRIED to use the web-site to carry out a seat change but the system resolutely refused to let me. It would highlight one of the seats I had been allocated, and showed the seats where I wanted to move to as being free but no. Every time I clicked on \"Save changes\" it politely told me that it hadn't and asked me to try again - which I did - repeatedly.\n\nSo I surfed over to the contacts page and was met with the predictable \"Use the web site\" fob-offs. I had tried that, so I just wanted to speak to a human, to see if they could do something - or explain why I couldn't.\n\nThat's 15 minutes of my life I won't get back. I don't know what was worse; the really awful \"musak\" assailing my ears, (likable only to the tone deaf or those on love with what electronic jiggery-pokery will do to the human voice), or those who like to be told every few seconds that \"Someone will be with you shortly\" - they won't.\n\nI travel regularly by train in Italy and the service from Trenitalia is not only massively better than what passes for \"service\" from LNER but it does so at under half the cost. No doubt LNER will bleat about subsidies but if you can't even manage to run a call-centre - what change a rail franchise?\n\nRubbish. I wish I had booked to fly.",

And sadly we were not the only unlucky ones.\nOn our returned journey the 27th same game. No seats available.

I didn't get the same luck and had to stand again 4h20 in a smelly train with broken toilets. I counted up to 20 people standing in the section of the train I was and that was not including people standing in the corridors and in the other carriages.\nI'd love to understand how the hell it's possible to permit people to book tickets still when the train is over booked. We paid 142 each (one way and return) to stand on a train for almost 9h. Awful travel. If I knew I would be standing I would have buy flights tickets instead. The policy of this company is clearly scandalous. They should provide seats to all their customers. That means limit the booking on the trains.\nThe staff was also not great. When we came to the desk in Edinburgh to ask if by chance their were any spare seats we could reserve we spoke to a very awkward women who looked at us like idiots.\nI'm trying to get a refund of my tickets with very little hope it will succeed.

Furthermore, due to an old back injury, standing for this length of time becomes considerably painful. I am shocked to learn that longhaul trips are overbooked to the point that the carriages are jam packed to the brim. Had I known this I never would have considered the train. It is ridiculous. Hoping to ensure that the return journey would not be the same story I immediately called reservations whilse still onboard, only to be told on various differrnt ways, that there was nothing they could, or would do. Thus we also had to stand for the length of the return journey!!! The result is that I am engrained with such a poor opinion of the entire LNER service that I will never recommend them to anyone.

Definitely took our money.  There were way too many people on the train and having to stand in the aisles and in front of the doors. Standing 3 hours is so ridiculous and how can they expect us to stand all the way London to Newcastle.  We paid the same amount as the people sitting.  We were then told we can't book seats as it's full.  Then why book the ticket if it's full?????  Greed !!!!  I will never take this train again.",
