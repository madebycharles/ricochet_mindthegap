The last person was the most unprofessional customer service adviser ever. They asked me to key payment details into my phone without any assurance about the process, confirmation that I would receive a receipt or anything. Whether I get a replacement card is anyone's guess. not only that, but most of the staff were rude, unprofessional, and sounded thoroughly fed up.

Their ethos is to fleece decent hard working people of money by making it almost impossible to deal with them - and what sort of organisation puts ULEZ cameras at the Royal Marsden to fleece visitors who are out of the area of \u00a390? Disgusting behaviour. They deliberately lie in their responses to FoIs, even to MPs, and evade answering the real questions relating to ULEZ (e.g. total cost of repair to damaged cameras) by giving totally misleading and dishonest answers (when they feel like responding and aren\u2019t hiding behind the ICO). A wholesale change in management is need to change this so there\u2019s transparency about where all the money goes that has been misspent. Hopefully when Khan gets the boot the new mayor will make TfLs mismanagement public knowledge and root out the rottenness pervading TFL. ",

It only means touch in/touch out at stations.\n\nI complained to TfL but was told \"contactless does NOT mean buying a ticket using contactless credit card and therefore I was correctly charged cash price\"",

I explained that happened before, still he said nahhh that doesn't happen, obviously, I am a liar. I reluctantly put my card through again and went through, to which he added sarcastically, its probably charged you 3 times now haha. \nThat is not the level of customer service anyone should expect to receive from any customer staff member. Charges don't show up until the next day, so I will wait and see. \n\nMeantime, tfl, stop robbing travellers and think about some customer service training for your staff. Maybe a pay rise would help with the clearly low moral I witness almost every time I use your 'services'.",

My car is exempt for Bristol which means it is Euro 6 compliant - it is apparently an 'early adopter' of the required standard. Before becoming aware of this, I paid the charge on 3 different occasions because I can't even go to the Wandsworth recycling centre without entering the zone! I cannot be exempted by tfl without sending them a copy of my V5, so have had to apply to the DVLA for an updated document. The whole situation is ridiculous and legalised theft.",

You made us late on purpose, laughing into our faces and this is your answer?

        "review_text": "I would give zero if there was. TFL telephone customer service is absolutely rubbish. I called them yesterday for getting a refund which had occurred due to train cancellation two weeks ago but I couldn't succeed after being on the phone with them for over an hour and half. Just called them again today to follow up but the lady on the phone who was seemingly answering from her home was so reluctant to even talk as she was purposely keeping her voice low or going silent repeatedly on and off just to prentend there is issue with the line and to make me put off with no outcome. She finally hang up the phone on me after I complained why her other colleague gave me wrong info yesterday by wasting my time unreasonably...\nIt's so upsetting to be treated like this. They definitely need basic trainings of how to communicate with customers first and learning basic knowledge about their job. They are probably assigned in the jobs with no essential training whatsoever and here it's the outcome. Bring your customer service staff back to office as they don't work properly from their homes without being supervised properly, they just waste time and damage your company's reputation as a result. They are totally useless for a simple task. So frustrating!",

That caused me annoyed and frustrated! This was not the first time having a problem getting hold of your team for refunding, it happened to me in the past.  \nYour customer service/ communication is really poor, and I am going to leave feedback on your main website/FB/Twitter,..so people like me be aware of these kinds of issues. \nUnfortunately, the fares are going up but the customer service has never improved!!!!",

This is displayed on the screen and is never sent in any confirmation / activation email.\nThe real cost of this becomes apparent when you attempt to login subsequently and cannot remember this long account number. You remember your password, your memorable date, everything. Just not the ridiculous random account number. And there is no way to retrieve this; the Forgot My Password  button helpfully demands your Account Number (recall, they made no effort to share this with you upon registration). \nYou now also cannot set up another account.\nGreat work guys.\n\nEDIT: An hour and a half later, I received an email with an attached letter which did have my account number. I added a star for that, but there's huge room for improvement. Please at least fix all the broken links",

Explain I can't do that because blue badge has taken until now to arrive.\n\nSo I'm told I just need to click the apply button which says it will cost \u00a310 but this won't charge me \u00a310 because I'm renewing within 90 days.\n\nTold him it would be useful if it gave this information on the site, rather than making it look like you'd be charged \u00a310.  So he told me I need to enter my account number and blue badge number to apply.  Told him again, yes I'm not an idiot I know how to apply, but I'm telling you that you should have something on the site saying it won't charge \u00a310.  again, he told me that because I'm applying within 90 to renew I won't be charged.  Again told him I understand that but they should have something online that says that.\n\nA simple thing that should have taken me about 1 minute to renew has taken over an hour because of a bad website, no relevant options on the phone number given and useless staff who just read from a script rather than using common sense and actually listening to what you are saying.",

The lovely staff at Edgware station took me into their office, gave me water, calmed me down and reassured me that I was safe, and then kindly arranged for me to stay in a hostel next door. They then looked up the earliest trains I could catch for King\u2019s Cross the next morning, and spoke to my friend on the phone to explain the situation. They even called to check in on me the next morning. I\u2019m forever grateful for the kindness they showed me and I really really hope they all get a raise!",

Sadiq will rob us and you with his imaginary ULEZ cameras, he shouts about ecology and his incompetent mediocre politics can't organize anything neither trains nor underground nor buses nor police in this country work properly, not to mention potholes on the roads where you can lose a wheel or break a the whole suspension. the entire board of TFL and Sadiq himself at the helm are fit only for disciplinary dismissal for wasting funds that could be spent on subsidizing and training the police, fire brigade hospital's spending funds on something else should be treated as theft committed by a government official.

I have been charged for the oyster \u00a37 and did not receive the oyster as says 5-7 working days. \n\nTried to contact customer service, so the call was no success waiting for a long time on the line, no one answered, there was an option to choose so TFL will call back and no need to wait on the line till someone answers, so I choosed that. After some time, I got a call back saying they calling from TFL, I checked the number on who called me uk and guess what it is a scam number so I'm not continuing conversation on the phone with them. Also intresting how they know I called TFL.\n\nI'm thinking what else I can do.\n\nI thought I just go to the station and ask the people who work there to check where is it, and when I receive it, and what is happening as it been almost 2 weeks since I order it and I need to go to work and I need oyster for that. And guess what, again, it was a waste of my time no one, and the information or ticket office was able to help me. Actually it seemed they have no intrest to look into my matter.\n\nI feel robbed and scamed. It doesn't matter it is only \u00a37 but wait, how much will I get charged for an unsuccessful call to TFL?  It is a steeling!\n\nEvery year, I pay more for travel, almost every month some strike, cancellations of the journeys and I have to be ok to pay hundreds of pounds every month for travel. But then there is no way to get in contact with TFL when there are these sorts of issues for the people who travel.\n\nApp is useless. There is no way to sort this issue yourself, I try to write this enquiry on the app under all possible options, and it is not submitting my request. Plus, if you forgot your memorable information on the account, there are no options to change it. Even consider that you have to use the verification number to log in to your account. \n\nI feel disappointed, I have used oyster for more than 10 years, but the TFL customer service should be improved as it has gone to zero, seems no one can sort your issue neither ticket office, neither information desk.",

I\u2019ve received a \u00a3270 fine for not paying the congestion charge on the 7th of February (as if I remember what I was doing 5 months ago). The thing is I\u2019ve never received the PCN for the initial \u00a390 fine. Then I received another 2 for paying the wrong dates\u2026 so far in 2023 I\u2019ve got \u00a3450 to pay in fines, for 3 honest mistakes, and we\u2019re not even half-way through the year. I\u2019ve tried to register for automatic payment but there was a bug so I guess it didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve told them I don\u2019t have the means to pay such a humongous sum of money but the \u201cContracts & Operations Manager\u201d wrote me back saying (in substance) that they don\u2019t give a s**t. The simplest mistake will be met by, not a slap on the wrist, but a punch in the face. This is how TFL treat people. And the worst part is that if more than 2 people are travelling it\u2019s cheaper to drive than to take public transport\u2026 so I guess the congestion charge will go up soon. Disgusting company.",

        "review_text": "What went wrong this time was what went wrong with the way tfl communicate between the public and it's staff esp its bus drivers. Lets take the W6 for example. From Edmonton Green In North London to Southgate. Usuall under 20 mins in reasonable traffic. Understand a driver getting upset when service users usually have a go at them for being late. Obviosly there must be reasons for delays. So service users and drivers get the hit end of the stick. Where's the communication? Resolve the Issues, I say to the people who are running it because it reminds me of the way NHS staff are In the hospitals!!! Today Thursday 16th February another one of the W6 Bus drivers game me such a dirty look. They seem to be unhappy with themselves and take it out on other people. They do it to all the foreigners except their black folk. I have been living in the same place for 5 years now and the drivers know of me. Yet i still get looks from them that obviosly tell me they don't like me. Mostly coming from the Black male drivers. In fact I find most Black people very Racist or prejudiced toward Greeks and the eastern Europeans. Surely something has to be done to put things straight. I have never given their drivers the reason to be aggressive. They try to scare me generally and i beleive their jealous because Im not like them and It's as If i'm not aloud to be at peace because they hate it. F/EM. \nMR A G Avgousti",

Everything being covered with selling us stories about how awesome the new trains are or how beatiful the station look... well, that is not improving the services at all! \nFor years I was so impressed with the way how TFL operates around such a huge city, but since last year it is an absolute disaster!

        "review_text": "1) On the 12th of December, because of TFL disruptions due to weather, my journey was significantly disrupted. I arrived to destination with more than an hour delay, and I paid more money for a longer journey\n\n2) On the 13th of December, due to a strike, I had to complete once again a longer and more expensive journey\n\n3) On the 16th of December, I called customer service. I had to call three times, and each time the call was abruptly ended after a very long wait and while I was speaking with an adviser, for reasons that are unknown to me. I suppose it was due to technical problems, but I would expect them to call me back, since they had my number\n\n4) During the third phone call, the customer advisor confirmed a refund. She put me on hold to get a reference number to give to me to confirm refund, but while I was on hold the telephone call ended once again\n\n5) It took me more than an hour to make all these phone calls, and this caused me further significant disruption\n\n6) Therefore, I wrote a formal complaint, covering all the points above\n\n7) The person getting back to me, Claire F - Customer Service Adviser - gave me conflicting information compared to a) the previous phone call and b) previous similar cases in which I was provided with a refund for similar reasons. She said that I was not entitled to a refund, as I managed to complete the journey. Hence without taking into account:\n\n- The delays due to longer journeys\n- The difference in money due to longer journeys\n- The disruptions caused by the poor phone call customer service\n\n8) I therefore replied and asked to escalate the complaint. Accordingly to TFL policy and guidelines: \"\"We try to resolve your complaint the first time you contact us. If you are not satisfied with our response, tell us and we will ask a team manager to review it.\"\n\n9) However, the policy and guidelines were not followed, and another Customer Service Adviser - Clare S - got back to me\n\n10) Despite me asking to escalate the complaint, this was not done and I was only given a generic link to the TFL website, which I believe is once again very poor customer service and a clear way to brush off my case\n\n11) I wrote another complaint, and Halimat M (again, not a team leader) got back to me, with an exact copy-and-paste from previous replies, not addressing the many points raised in my complaint and not tailoring the response to my individual needs, making me feel completely devalued and disrespected\n\nI am now planning to go through Ombudsman and ask even more than the refund, for all the time this is taking.\n\nHorrible, appalling, abusive customer service.",

I went to Intercom information, announcement then made over loudspeaker vaping not allowed.\nThere were shouts of 'snitch' from the group and continuous abusive/negative comments, more vaping.  I went back to intercom, asked for LU staff to come.  LU operative cut off.  I called back operative said would try to send someone.\nAbuse from group, told me to 'chill', 'batty boy', what was under his beanie hat/ginger?, should have asthma attack, continuous laughter, comments.\nOne of group went to intercom (who said most of abuse) said to operative I was being racist.\nI returned to intercom as abuse continued, operative said I was being racist and should \"go to another carriage\" (strange as I was on platform).\nRelentless abuse and made sick by vaping, nothing done by LU 4:30-5:00am 1/1/23 South Kensington tube Piccadilly Line Westbound.\nAt Hounslow West tube large self prom pics of LU customer service/performance/safety strategy managers 16-25 years experience - all of them and \nSouth Kensington operative all failing - vaping and abusive scum allowed.",

It adds on average another 2.5 hours or more onto my Appel day just travelling home. It is so disgraceful I have had to complain about it multiple times before they even made it a double decker route! It passes three schools just in the portion I have to travel which is only Enfield to potter bar , Some mornings I couldn\u2019t get to work because of it!",

I have called royal mail customer service number they explained about back log and strikes.

No complaints there and is reflected in the rating. However, I think you should stop advertising OysterCard to non-UK travelers and encourage them to use their contactless credit cards instead. I used Oyster on my last trip and since I am unable to create an Oyster account (needs UK address and phone number) I cannot get my ride history. I requested it from TFL customer service and even got back a token and promise of 10 day turnaround but its now close on 45 days and I haven't heard back. If you need to do an expense report, much more advisable to use a regular touch-less US credit card -- its as convenient and not much different expense-wise.",

Rich don't care and criminals/thieves/beggars never have to pay. \n\nCar prices have sky rocketed due to stupid ULEZ rules and car ownership is not affordable. Have to use car hire when needed instead of relying on public transport\n\nThis year, suffered 3 major tube strikes and car hire prices sky rocketed, impacting my critical work.\n\nGot penalty for passing hidden school zone area in a hired car for first visit to my kid's school. I was new to such traffic rules and country. The sign was like an essay and by the time I finish reading, I was captured on camera. 200 GBP fine gone from middle class person for small mistake.\n\nH28 bus comes once is 2-3 hours frequently and can terminate randomly in the mid-way. Regularly walked couple of miles with my kid to reach his tuition classes in hot summer. Already complained.\n\nToday Overground is not working and my family is stuck away from home and trying to find alternate route.",

It would\u2019ve been cheaper to take a taxi between all of the lost money, and the stress. If you can avoid the TFL in London, avoid it at any cost you can afford.

So it went into overdraft for a while without me realising it and got an extra bill at the end from the bank.\n\nI tried registering an account to get the refund, didn\u2019t work, kept getting an error which doesn\u2019t even tell you what you did wrong. By the way the register form is the worst form I have come across since internet was invented.\n\nI emailed them, they take 2 weeks to reply and when they do they just tell you try registering again or we are looking into your issue. I emailed them close to 10 times until I got tired. I wish their whole database and server could go offline for at least a week and the hacker demands for them to improve their services and pay back all the money they stole from customers who can\u2019t get their refunds cause they are running a scam at this point. Stealing from unknowing customers.\nAnother option will be a having a huge sign at the tube in Heathrow that says \u201cWE HAVE A HORRIBLE WEBSITE SO DON\u2019T EXPECT REFUNDS IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY TAP WITH CREDIT CARD!\u201d\n\nWord of advice, never tap in or out with a credit card that doesn\u2019t have a contactless limit, or else you will find yourself in my shoes.\n\nIf tfl ever reads this, just know that am not the only unhappy customer and if you don\u2019t reform your services, one day it will all come crashing down on you.",

        "title": "MISSED DENTAL APPOINTMENT",
        "review_text": "Oh dear what a disaster. I was due to attend a 1.30pm appointment Thursday 13 October at the dental clinic in Guy\u2019s Hospital. This required a tube journey to London Bridge and my first time accessing the tube as a wheelchair user. When using the journey planner I could not grasp, to be what I consider a very confusing set of symbols supposedly designed to make your journey by wheelchair as smooth as possible. On entering my trip details in I\u2019m provided with a very simple 34 minute ride using Hammersmith and City Line then transferring to the Jubilee line at Baker Street. By bus it\u2019s a 4 bus journey taking 1hour 10 minutes. This is where I made one of two mistakes. I was always journey planning as a mobile user not in need of step free wheelchair accessibility. The first box you see under cycling and other options includes a full step free access symbol which completely went over my head. The next boxes were the tube journey offered, impossible in the wheelchair then the 4 bus trip which was impractical. I began a Google search on how to access the Jubilee line by lift but was finding this difficult. I downloaded a pdf Avoiding Stairs Tube Guide. This was a jumble of confusing symbols. My second mistake was not going by taxi but I wasn\u2019t sure I was mobile or strong enough to enter and exit the cab. Finally the day before travel and exhausting all attempts to find a solution I called TFL. The advisor gave me instructions to enter at Paddington Elizabeth line and take the tunnel to connect via lift to the Bakerloo line, exiting at Waterloo then using the lift to join the Jubilee line. Arriving at Waterloo the gap was too wide to allow the wheelchair off so we traveled the two stops to Elephant and Castle. A supervisor attempted to get Waterloo to have someone on the platform to provide assistance but they didn\u2019t appear to be cooperative. Finally just before our tube departed the supervisor advised that there wasn\u2019t lift access to the Jubilee line at Waterloo. The only solution was to return to Paddington, missing my dental hospital appointment. In order to find out and to see what another advisor would suggest I just called the TFL number. It\u2019s not a pleasant experience. Not only do they suggest that you avoid using public transport, rather walk or cycle to free up the space for those who really need it but you should only press star to speak to someone if you are disabled otherwise use the automated service. We have an NHS service that we are supposed to protect by not using it and a public transport system we shouldn\u2019t use either. This is really clown town London 2022. Kevin the advisor I just spoke to (Friday 14 October) was polite but seemed to be finishing a meal or taking dishes to the sink. When I asked if he would kindly enter my journey to see what his best option would be he said NO and apologised as the system was down. It isn\u2019t down on my I Pad. In future I will avoid using the tube as a disabled passenger. Maybe in time and with practice it would become easier to navigate but this experience has left me disappointed and dissatisfied. UPDATE 20 OCTOBER 2022. My journey to the dental hospital should have been a breeze. It\u2019s my fault for not using the step free symbol to plan my trip. Had I done so taking the Elizabeth Line from Paddington to Farringdon, then transferring to Thames Link for London Bridge. Why oh why did the TFL advisor not use it instead of giving me the wrong information. Why didn\u2019t she recommended this for future trips. Instead she said grab a leaflet which will give you the information you need. As I\u2019ve already explained the symbols are impossible to understand. I now have to wait over a month for another dental appointment.",

NEVER opt for a callback; that'll just compound your frustration! When I hear about services being privatised, TfL is flagship for THIS TO NOT TO HAPPEN!!! People that work there don't care about your issue & appear to be used to disgruntled passengers. I can only imagine trains or utilities are nationalised to TfL standard....utter chaos & catastrophe!

Loud and annoying music or sound from trashy noisy films coming from the commuters' phones.\nAn annoying recorded voice that claims you can call the authorities if you see 'something that doesn't look right': yea, everything!!! But no security around.\nCommuters zig-zagging left and right like brainless dogs, instead of walking on their lanes.\nRude and mindless people on the platforms, standing outside the doors, right in front, blocking commuters from getting off the trains.\nStations away from London' centre are as filthy as they get.\nSuper expensive tickets, the most expensive in the world for the worst service in the world.\nEscalators that don't work and they take forever to fix.\nA total scam.",

Oh not that simple with TFL and their Technology.\nFirst they told me they could not cancel my travel card on my Oyster and would have to cancel the entire Oyster Card.\nSecond they said I would have to pay an admin fee of \u00a35.\nThird I would have to buy another Oyster Card at \u00a35.\nHowever the worst was they said I would only get \u00a332 back and when you deduct the \u00a310 fees that works out to only \u00a322 refund from my \u00a3147 pounds when only using half the time.\nLegal theft. TFL should be ashamed as its not enough that I lose countless money during strikes but also cannot get  a simple refund back of my own money when I have not used the whole travel card period.\nThey have these unfair terms because they have a monopoly so you have no choice but as you can see its criminal to take advantage of working people.\n\nI refused the insult sum.

Our Coldplay gig was reorganised from the 19th August 2022 to the 21st August 2022 due to the tube  strikes. \nAfter the concert, they overcrowded the tube stations, causing many to faint and panic. The TFL announced there would be no further trains after around 22:45. It\u2019s amazing how TFL have the balls to cancel the last trains and not run later trains. \nIt took us 5 hours to get back to our hotel at Kings Cross. This normally should\u2019ve taken 30-45 mins. Walking around certain parts of London is not safe at that time. \nThere was not even an apology from TFL. We were one of the lucky ones that did get back to our hotel. We know people that waited until 5 in the morning to get the first train back.\nNot the first time you\u2019ve done this. I know the TFL won\u2019t care and they probably won\u2019t even issue an apology.\nI know they won\u2019t learn from this, as it\u2019s happened many times in the past before.\nUtterly disappointed with the TFL, and that\u2019s putting it nicely.",

Their main website gives advice and a link to applying for an Over 60's Photocard, but the process is difficult, frustrating and very time consuming.  \n\nFirstly, the link doesn't work on the main website.  They don't explain that you must apply on a separate Photocard website (had to phone them to find that out).\n\nSecondly, the online photocard application is very difficult to complete if you have impaired eyesight or or suffer dyslexia. You must insert your full 30 digit passport number into 6 boxes.  It's very easy to make a mistake, as those digits are bunched up, not separate entries.\n\nThirdly, whilst the app does warn you if the passport number is incorrect, it does not warn you of other errors. Therefore, if your date of birth is incorrect.  you will get an error message, but it won't say what is wrong. Instead, it generates a letter to take to the Post Office to check your ID details.  But that won't work either, because if the date of birth is incorrect, the Post Office will reject your application and you lose your \u00a320 fee.  \n\nFourthly, you must download a passport photo, which must meet very strictly defined rules for appearance and format.  Even if you follow those rules, your photo application can be rejected by automated email without any explanation whatsoever.  If you phone their helpline, they won't give a reason; they'll read off a generic script.",

They are pricing the poor and working classes and independent businesses out of using London's road as most of us cannot afford new ULEZ compliant vehicles or electric ones nor even have the space or costs of facilities to charge them. When there has been train strikes, heatwaves and their network is down - key workers such NHS staff, firefighters, police, sanitation workers etc who were all holding the city together, working tirelessly and maintaining order (on TfL's sites/ roads etc) did not have their ULEZ or Congestion Fee's wavered so had to pay extortionate fuel fees, parking costs and then a stealth tax for the privilege of getting into a gutty day of work to keep the city going!?!  You could not make that up. Imagine if all these NHS workers, cops, refuse workers, firefighters etc called in sick on those days due to not being able to afford to get to work.\nThere are various FAKE congestion and ULEZ charge payment sites that TfL warn consumers about which appear at the top of a search engine before TfLs own payment links. I find it hard to believe that a big organisation such as TfL/ Mayor's Office with their weighty legal departments and links to big business, government and Google themselves - cannot get these sites removed or closed down or at least alter their algorhythm?!  If they pursued this with the same vigour as they do chasing fixed penalties or fees from the public then they might have a chance of doing some good!",

        "review_text": "Zero stars for Bus line 83 ,route Lycee International (London, Forty Lane,HA9) to Hendon Station (NW4), today 26.06.2022 at 3pm. I was holding the handrail in front of the exit door, because of poor ventilation on this bus - windows really small, and partially closed, and air conditioning non existent. The bus driver had a rant at me because in his imagination people cannot get off the bus(!) if I am holding the handrail. Please note, he saw me moving out of the way when a couple with a baby got off the bus, with the pushchair and everything; he also allowed another young guy to stay in the exact same place I was staying , and he said nothing to him. ( I moved because of his rant).\nAt Hendon Station he stopped the bus, and said he is not moving untill I get off the bus. I did not do anything wrong, all the other passengers to whom I explained the driver's rant agreed that it was a normal thing to hold the handrail in front of the door. However, this particular bus driver threatened me to call the Police- even if I did not do anything wrong. In this time all passengers got off the bus, he did not give them a transfer ticket and he said he didn' t care. He did not call the Police and he lied about it just to intimidate. Then,when he saw a Police car passing by, he started sounding some allarm he had to get their attention. I got off the bus to see if the Police car would pull over, and if I could speak with them. He immediately closed the doors, and started the bus the second I got off.\nWell, it turns out this bus driver totally abused his position (because he could, and nobody will hold him accountable); wasted people' s money and time,as he made everybody wait for no justified reason but his own personal whims, and did not give one single transfer ticket; also, he threatened me to call the Police- even if I did not do anything wrong, but he was immagining things about people not being able to use the hand rail;then he also tried to get the Police to pull over even if he did not even call them. \nI frequently use buses in London, but have never come across such absurd behaviour! For sure it lets a lot to be desired! And it' s not customer service, it' s only this driver' s personal issues, ie : things happening in his mind.  Only for this bus driver delusions -that because of me standing in front of the exit door ( where handrails are actually installed for a reason!!) people cannot use the exit door, or cannot hold the handrail when getting off the bus! All people had to empty the bus, and wait for a new bus to continue their journey because this driver had issues! \nI am not aware in what circumstances a driver can do such things, but if he was capable to stop the bus for no valid reason, and lie about calling the Police, it makes you wonder. \nAnyways, I will make sure to use the buses in London less and less- afterall, the bus fares are paying this individual' s salary, and he allows himself to inconvenience so many people for his imaginary problems with holding the handrail in front of the exit door.",

She was hardly moving and sat on the first seat a front. Near the end of our journey she needed to throw up and to keep the bus clean and the passengers safe I gave her her school backpack to do so. Our bus stop came and I wanted to take her out from the front door, so she won't throw up all over the bus till she gets to the back door. The bus driver didn't open it and said to go to the back one. I repeated few times that my daughter is very unwell, but he insisted to go to the back, even seeing she hardly moving, and with the most arrogant tone of his voice said 'So what's the problem with the back door?'. This could be his own child...The minute she came out through the back door she nearly collapsed on the ground...It's very upsetting experience and this is not the first time, bus driver has been acting in this manner with us. They need to be trained in customer service, also disabilities awareness, my child is autistic too and the experience deeply upset her. Bus drivers must never forget we trust them with our lives and to treat us back with respect.",

Well, when I entered my email address why didn\u2019t it tell me at that point? Jesus wept, who designs this process?\n\nSo, try to reset password and I have to fill out all sorts of details like an account number that I have no idea what is.\n\nThe person who designed this account creation process clearly thanks the only online account people use are the TFL one.\n\nNot only that, try searching \u2018pay ULEZ online\u2019 and you will see fake sites, a page on the TFL website warning you about fake sites, but absolutely no easy way explaining how to pay for it. Clicking on \u2018pay ULEZ\u2019 actually takes you to a 404-error page not found.\n\nNext thing I\u2019m going to do is search LinkedIn and find out who works in the digital design team at TFL because they really could do with a career break and a break for IT completely and let people in who know what they are doing. These people are utterly clueless.\n\nThe street maps, by the way, are a work of cartographic genius, but I suspect that is a very small team within TFL.",

On my third license renewal they want me to under take \u201cAGAIN\u201d the Topographical Skill test as well as the English Test. As Malcolm Gladwell discussed in his bestseller, \u201cOutliers\u201c, to become an expert it takes 10000 hours. I my self spend 18 000 + hours on the road with 15 000 + trips and rating of 4.98* stars on the Uber platform, but you see TFL will bring you back to year zero for a license that requires an IQ of 90 points. I\u2019m fine and cable of doing other jobs but the problem is, I LOVED LOVED LOVED my job. I had a great pleasure of preforming my job. But you see because they have an agenda against Mini Can drivers for the sake of their grumpy old dangerous unskillful \u201cBLACK TAXI DRIVERS\u201d. It\u2019s been 8 months since I applied for license renewal and  nothing. I see less and less mini cab drivers on the road not only in town but also in areas outside town. Ok\u2026I get it, TFL-( Totally Fu\u20ac\u00a3ed  London) wants to make the 1st Zone a Black Taxi Heaven, but in general Black Taxis don\u2019t provide service in zone 3,4,5,6,7 and those areas have lack of Mini Cab drivers because of the deliberate scrutiny against the private hire drivers. I guess Totally Fu\u20ac\u00a3ed  London wants every body depended on their public transport. On other hand they want you to pass an English test Level B1 for a job that requires a level A1 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Yet the hole renewal experience is difficult enough, that requires a significant level of English do deal with the hole process. Calling TFL on its own is an expensive thing and sometimes cost you \u00a340 of a phone bill as it takes hours they to answer your calls.",

I was compelled to contact the driver at the end of my journey.  This was easy to do since my journey, as well as the train also terminated at the same station.  The driver gave me her name as Ms. Serah (Sarah!).  \nI am at a loss for words of showering enough praise on her for making this one of the most memorable journeys out of the countless ones that I have undertaken with tfl underground services.  My journey from Camden Town upto Edgware station was filled with humour, laughter and joy relating to life, the weather and TfL, through her clear voice announcements throughout the journey.  She made the journey and for a short period, life a breeze.  It was not only me but also the other passengers who enjoyed her pleasant clear crispy voice announcements in the journey.  It was almost unlike what announcements you hear by many other drivers.  Most of which are inaudible and feel like they have been forced to or talking to themselves. \nThis lady is joy to travel with and I do hope she gets to be promoted (if there are) to positions whereby she can generate more happiness for the masses.\nPersonally, I think she would make a very excellent motivational speaker if she ever thought of changing her career.\nAlthough it was a very brief encounter she let me take her picture which will stay in my photo collections for a very long time.",

Freight trains always have priority at peak hours, so passengers are normally stranded on platforms. Then join overcrowded services. Appalling.\n\nIt\u2019s shocking to see how a city like London has such a dreadful transport system. Years of constant underinvestment from the Government (normally, a Conservative one) and customers paying more than enough but somehow still suffering on a daily basis. It\u2019s clearly an issue of mismanagement.\n\nThe only thing for customers to do is CLAIM FOR DELAYS, CLAIM AND CLAIM until their finances will call for action.

Out of curiosity and frustration for how many issues, delays and cancellations this line experiences on a regular basis, I started counting how many days I suffered significant disruptions on my journey resulting in time loss, financial cost and psychological impact on me and the people I care. I can confirm without any doubts this line is significantly disrupted at least 50% of the time, most of the time between Queens Park and Harrow and Welstone, making it completely unreliable. When an issue is temporary it can be disguised as unexpected, when it has been ongoing for at leas 6 years is just purely incompetency and terrible management.",

        "review_text": "There is no timetable for the busses or tubes, so you just have to leave 10-30 minutes early to make sure you get anywhere on time. The busses are very slow because there are almost no bus lanes, but even those few are filled with parking cars. Sometimes the busses and tubes will stop randomly to 'even out the service' even though you had to wait for 10 minutes at the stop. Other times there will be 3 of the same bus one after the other but suddenly its not important to even out the service. If you are waiting at a bus stop and there is a bus there (which isnt your bus) often the bus you are waiting for will just skip the stop even if you are frantically waving. The bus drivers believe they are in formula 1 because there have been multiple occasions where I've almost fallen off my seat or fallen down tbe stairs. The 340 bus always says 'due' at the stop, yet somehow never arrives. The tubes will sometimes not come for 10 or more minutes during peak hours. Noone is enforcing any of the rules, people are pushing themselves through the gates without paying, 60% of people dont wear masks, there have even been people smoking on the trains yet noone did anything. If you tell tfl staff about antisocial behaviour like a passanger harassing others they will pretend to do something but not actually do anything.  The tubes are somehow always suspended due to 'planned works' during the weekend yet dont seem to be any better, while the replacement busses are 10 times as slow and stop in random places that the tube doesn't stop at. But worst of all it doesnt seem like any of the issues that people have with TFL are being worked on or fixed.",

After receiving a penalty charge which I found unreasonable, I tried to explain my situation to someone on the phone, and she just referred me to write an enquiry on their website. After submitting a 3000 word detailed enquiry with photo documents from my side, I received a generic reply with no sincerity at all. Completely disregarding my situation and the proofs I attached. Then I tried to call again, and the agent on the phone has been very rude and disinterest to my case. She even told me that if you want to make a complain the information is just on the website, go look it up yourself. \n\nRight now I feel very hopeless and feeling TFL can just charge me whenever they want with a penalty. I hope to get in touch with someone and take a closer look of my case. I have completely lost my faith for TFL and made me very uncomfortable of traveling to London for the next time.",

My car came up as non chargeable for the ULEZ but was ticked for congestion charging.\nI duly paid the \u00a315 so as to avoid a fine. A friend suggested that I had not entered the congestion zone so I rang TFL. They could not tell me if I had been in a congestion zone. If I thought I had not been in a chargeable area I could get a credit against another day if I did it today only and pay an extra \u00a32.50.\nIf I had waited for a letter to say I have been in the zone it is a \u00a3160 fine.\nWhat a rip off by TFL, it is an outrageous situation and just a moneymaking machine to hide the bad management and decisions of others. How can you not give me my money back. \nHow many other people are being totally ripped off?\nI have no desire to visit the London area again.",

They are destroying London culture - not because of road charges but because of the way charges and fines are implemented. Congestion charge is \u00a315 and you have 3 days to pay - but they neglect to tell the unaware that if you pay after day one they\u2019ll charge you \u00a317.50. You can\u2019t check if you strayed into the congestion zone or not you just better pay if you think you have. I called to pay the congestion charge and they told me the van wasn\u2019t mine and they couldn\u2019t take payment. This was a new employee who got it wrong but they still sent me a PCN. Try speaking with someone! Impossible. I hate TFL more than I hate dog sh** on the pavement. Imagine working for them and having to put TFL on your CV. Embarrassing or what.",

Called the number and was told that I didn't register the credit card number NOR my car registration!! What kind of computer system is that? The chap said I was going to receive an email with the confirmation......Nothing! Called again after 2 hours and a very friendly woman (at the start!!) said she would reset my log in details ( as it was impossible for me to do so..) After she did that, I tried and guess what? Nothing!!!! She got angry and said there was nothing she could do about it...it was probably my computer...! Talk about passing the buck!! 3rd rate experience!!",

I had to call tfl endless, the operators do their best, but the system is absolutely careless for us as customers. I have submitted an online complaint on tfl website, after 10mins of completing all the squares needed, told me \" There was an error. Please try again\". We are used and taking advantage of, because they know that we don't have choices other than using their services, here in London. Not speaking about the stations and trains/tubes, very dirty and there is no staff in most of the stations to ask help from, in case of an emergency. On the buses its even worse, all the windiwsare open during winter keeping us freezing on the way home. Some bus drivers stop the screen after 9-10pm , so we never know the stations , if my phone battery its gone or if I am turist, the bus its not telling me where am I going  what the stations are etc, because the driver just closes the screen , just like that !!! Some buses have just half of the writing, you , as a customer, have to guess the other half!!!!!",

The service is absolutely terrible, drivers are rude and don't know how to communicate in the slightest , not to mention i have experienced drivers literally walk off the bus during their shift to go for a cigarette, or because of a driver swap, just leaving the bus in the middle of nowhere. But above all, it is the companies greed that make them unbearable. As a student , i have no other option than to pay for monthly tickets through TFL to get to uni. In the duration of one term i have lost more than \u00a3400 through this tragic company. They failed to send me my student oyster card which makes travel cheaper and also had my tram past on there, due to an ' error in the system.' They haven't answered any of my emails asking for possible reimbursements and they continue to take more money out of my account due to ' unpaid fares' in which i have none, they are literally robbing me.",

Why? \n\nThe answer is simply? Too much money available, tax payer\u2019s money wasted because in the end there will be more \ud83d\udcb7available. \nIf TFL would be a private company, its staffs would care much more about everything. \n\nYet again, lots of TFL\u2019 staffs are counting the days for retirement, they do not give a s**t about anything anymore,  not respecting timeframes, careless about  spending and so on..  \n\nUnfortunately the actual government does not care much about it I guess and therefore there always will be money from central government available for them..tax payers one by the way.. wasted. \n\nIncreasing fees and services fee a lot every year will not solve this problem? \nIt will create anger throughout communities without solving anything. \n\nA strong leadership, competent people, workers who really want to work respecting the rules and following the protocols would be a good start for TFL gain respect and trust again within communities. \n\nWondering if TFL would care about my review and others one written down below?\n\nIt is time for some authorities fire those dinosaurs out of public jobs and tell them \u201cgo whistle\u201d and grab staffs who respects its duties and actually work!",

I knew a little about ULEZ but didn't realise that half of fore street is in the ULEZ area and half is not.( how silly does that sound) On Xmas eve I received 1 letter from TFL stating I have a fine for ULEZ. When I called them up they said I had another 4 fines amounting to \u00a3400 !! I stated that I have only received 1 fine letter and none for the others and that i haven't had anything else. Common sense would tell you that If you had a fine for going to the same road you wouldn't travel there again and if I had known sooner I would not have gone. When i made an appeal they said its been rejected and you have to pay \u00a3400 pounds even though I received 1 letter at the time. The lack of empathy and common  sense from TFL was shocking and made me utterly speechless. Even if they said you can pay half the fine or at least 1 that's fair enough but to punish me and making me pay \u00a3400 pounds just after Xmas was shocking. These morons don't have a clue and will take your money under any circumstances.They need to Look at the terrible reviews from  customers and start treating people with empathy and respect.",

As we were eating breakfast my mum noticed that the next bus was in 1 minute, and the one after in 15 minutes. If we caught the 15 minute one, it would mean my brother would be late, so we stopped eating, grabbed his coat and bag, and tried to get outside as quickly as possible to catch the 1 minute bus. \nMy brothers and I just managed to get outside in time as the bus arrived, however, my mum was just getting her bag. We said to the driver, \"Our mum is just getting her bag, and she'll only be a second. Our house is just here, please can you wait?\" The bus stop is just outside the house, so the driver knew that my mum would only be a few seconds, but didn't want to wait anyway. He quite rudely shook his head at us but didn't say anything, so we were a bit annoyed and tried to linger on the bus for a second as I could see my mum running out of the door, but when the driver started waving his arms angrily at us, I picked up my youngest brother and me and my other brother got off the bus. I had pointed at my mum and said, \"She's just here!\" as my mum ran towards the bus, but the driver shut the doors in our faces and drove off.",

I email a complaint and get a generic reply from a person called Jay telling me how to register my card and change my password, which is what I have attempted and complained about. I go round in circles. \n\nBut, the email says I \u2018can\u2019 access travel details\u2026\u2026\nbut only journeys in last 7 days. W.T.F?They can supply 7 days worth, but not the past 12 months?

When I initially paid the \u00a317:50 my TFL account acknowledged payment but didn't tell me it was the wrong date. My TFL account stated \"no outstanding charges\" after payment. TFL officials say they are standing by their penalty charge notice because I chose the day after instead of the day before. Furthermore they won't reimburse me for the \u00a317:50 they acknowledge was the wrong day of travel and their congestion charge was not applicable on that day. \n\nWe are dealing with mercenaries enforcing a stealth tax.

I don't live in London so haven't a clue. I am shown a lovely map with coloured lines on with an arrow signalling the address but nothing to say what they mean except for zones like inner and outer. Is this CC or ULEZ or the other one. Can't even remember what that is called. Is it too much to ask for me to pop in the postcode then go to a page where TFL tell me what I have to pay? And then I pay? Instead I'm guessing and so will pay all three as I don't want a fine. To everyone funding this website through, I'm guessing very high fees on a daily basis, I feel for you. I really do. It took me 10 mins to pay my local congestion charge. What's up TFL?",

I don't know how the drivers stand it having to deal with the public and drive in busy London streets. It seems very stressful and difficult to me but years ago a bus company would not take my application to be a driver any further because of my medicine. (And No, I am not entitled to a Freedom Pass or benefits). Thank God I don't drive anymore and perhaps I would have a different view of tfl if I had to pay congestion charges. TFL are a vital, useful service for me and for others. Not that I ever voted for Sadiq Khan. I vote Conservative. And when London had its referendum back in 1999 on whether to have a London mayor I voted No. But I can't say I've got anything against tfl.",

Called again (and another wait for a call back) and got NO help from their shambolic excuse for a Customer Services Dep't.

I called customer services for 2 days running, spending up to 1hour waiting for the call to be answered, no answer. This is shockingly unethical service. I am now left with the decision of setting up a new account and paying another \u00a320 hoping that it goes well this time, or letting my 16years old son pay the full fare to get to and from college and hope on the wind that this will be mysteriously sorted. I am really disappointed and disgusted by this experience.",

When they try to phone TFL they have to wait 4 to 5 hours to get someone on the line. The employees are useless. They do not know what they're doing, each time it's a different answers when there's an actual answer. Request a refund? They hung up on me... Give the Oyster Card number? Put on hold for 2hrs then got hung up on. One agent literally told me he didn't know how to request a refund then hung up. Promised a refund in 4 to 5 working days? It's been 20 days - no refund. This is a disgrace and I know that they don't care as they have the monopoly in London. We're literally being hold hostage.

I waited 3-4 hours each of the four times I called. They say they are experiencing high call volumes but the truth is they don't have the staff to cope with it.\n2. The issue I'm trying to fix is simple. The photo card they gave me expired a week from when I ordered it, when it should expire the following year. I have one year left at university. Each time I called, each telephone operator had a different approach, some had no idea what to do, there's no consistency. Each time I called I was put on hold and the phone just cut out.

There was no notification that it had expired. I tried to contact them many times, most recently September this year, as I'm still doing an apprenticeship so I have little money coming in, but my travel costs have increased. \n2. My Apple Pay stopped working and again, I had no luck with advice on what was happening or how I could pay for my travel. \n3. I applied for a photocard and heard nothing - apparently I'm not an apprentice (would love my wages to reflect this belief!)\n4. Bought an oyster card instead and that has been working for a few weeks but I now can't make any top ups. No one at TfL spoke to me - I gave up after being on hold for 2 hours 13 minutes whilst at work. Thankfully my bank were more help and none of the pending transactions are actually going through.\n5. I've applied for a different photocard where I've struggled to pay for the fees with the salary changes and again - heard nothing!\n6. Just to add it while I'm here - why can't stations update passengers on where trains are, any delays, or any information at all? I don't often carry my crystal ball when commuting but don't appreciate being a young girl at silly hours of the morning trying to get from A to B via any station I can. Train staff mocked me for missing my train, bearing in mind I'd been sat on the platform for 30-40 minutes and only saw a bunch of pigeons. Funnily enough the pigeons didn't have a Central Line train.",

Not much of a hobby I know but at least we have the pandemic. I am known as Steve but on my driving licence it is Steven. Registered on the website but would not take my driving licence number. Printed off the verification page and went down the post office. Amazingly post master would not accept the different names.\nOK back to TFL portal. I could not now change my name by adding an N. Rang up. I have to create a new Email and sign up again.\nManaged to create a new Email account. Registered printed off verification sheet paid \u00a320 and waited. \nThe wait was not long and within a week I received.....a letter stating that my driving licence details were different online from what I had given the Post Office. Mmmm isn't that why you use the verification system, because you can't load documents. I dont believe I had entered my driving licence number.\nNo worries ring up again. helpful person the other end of the phone got me to complete a form to say you have a problem. That was on 11th September 2021. I sent a picture of my driving licence with the number visible.\nGot an enquiry number. Rang up on 24th did not know anything about the enquiry number would get someone to contact me back. No callback and no response so called again today\nJust spoken to someone who could not get over the fact I have two photocard accounts, but did say I had made payment. She tried to be helpful. Wanted me to go down the post office and use the verification letter. Groundhog day. \nSaid I wanted to complain. \nShe advised me to complete the same enquiry form that I have not received a response from the 11th September. Today is 27th September and you still have my \u00a320. Just want an  60+ Oyster photocard with the picture I  have uploaded  twice.",

I logged in on my bank to check if there are sufficient funds to cover the cost and noticed that I have been charged the amount of the \u00a320 (pending), however the status of the card online is still awaiting payment and I have not received a confirmation email that the order was completed. \nI have experienced similar issues in the past when I was trying to top up or buy a seasonal ticket online.

Customer service agents trained to give zero service and advice and were the total opposite of helpful. Worst organisation in the government by far full of inept people and backward systems. If you dont pay or forget to pay \u00a315 you get fine for \u00a380. Thats 5 x the original amount and 136% increase. It all ok if its tfl doing this! If it was a private company they would get prosecuted for extortion. My case is clear. I paid two days and I was in the congestion zone two days. The website is built in a way that does not inform customers if they have entered the congestion zone and need to pay. You enter the wrong day if your dyslexic and they have no sympathy or mercy.

Why is it necessary to make everything a link and harder for people to apply for an oyster? And something that I find so ridiculous, is when we're trying to log in our details are apparently incorrect. Trying to log in can take hours because sometimes they don't even send you an email to reset your password or make you wait hours for one to come. The service in every station I've been to is horrendous especially when the staff are too lazy to stop people from pushing pass the barriers which causes the barriers to break down and need assistance. It just makes everyone late for school, home or coming back after a long day; they could at least have someone on guard??",

I avoid using public transport pre COVID because it is overcrowded and very very expensive. The poor are being out-priced and it\u2019s wrong. There was a lot of traffic so Google map re routed me but I came home and paid the congestion charge today as I saw a sign but because I was driving past it I did not have time to read it to be sure. So I searched on the TFL website for a way to confirm their cameras picked up my registration but I could not find a way to check. I signed up for an account so I paid the congestion charge just to be on the safe side  in case TFL send me a penalty charge. Now reading the reviews it looks like I may not get a refund when I call TFL tomorrow to explain to them what and why I did!  Also they need to realise that their opening hours to help customers needs to be extended and they have to understand customers who paid to enter the congestion zone but did not enter it should get a refund. It is unacceptable and immoral of TFL to hold on to customers money for their own gains.",

When  I attempted to pay on Sunday they stick me with an added \u00a32.50 for not paying on the day of travel. Nowhere on their site did I see an alt way to pay. I emailed on Sun to query the uplift with no reply whatsoever. I called on Mon 26 July and was virtually threatened with a PCN if I didn't pay by midnight Tuesday. I explained the situation and said that I even had a screenshot of the message regarding planned maintenance. That fell on deaf ears. Whomever I was dealing with had zero interest in helping. I was also told that any email enquiry or application for refund/review will take up to TEN WEEKS just to get a response. Lord knows how long it would take to get any actual action.  I am beginning to see tfl as nothing more than a money-grabbing organisation with little regard for the communities it is suppose to be helping. Pathetic response to a reasonable request.",

I  have been injured by a loose panel. Hanging away from the celling from a tfl stair way leading into the station, and even tho I have photo evidence and it was seen by the station manger confirming the defect. They still refuse to except responsibility. They failed to keep a accident book which is required from all businesses with more then 10 members of staff which they clearly have more then. To add insult to injury they taped off the area and got workmen to fix the loose panel with no screws. This is a disrespectful act. And needs immediate attention. If safety is not a priority on our transport service then tfl should be closed and the transport contract should be given to another company or group that can assure and provide better safety for all of there paying customers.

But I want to mention the young guy Mustafa \"Mus\" who literally walked all the way to where the taxi was picking myself & my brother up to take us to KC. Nothing was too much trouble for him.

        "review_text": "The changes implemented to roads in Greenwich have been done so badly congestion increased, stress increased, probably pollution increased as a result. So many local people's lives made harder and more unpleasant. Its so hard to get to do a weekly shop. Loads of people don't have time to shop for food one bag at a time, there has to be a way to shop locally for a whole weekly shop. No buses near me to go to the shopping/supermarket area. Bring tubes properly to South East London rather than waste huge amounts of public money blocking off essential routes. It is depressing to allow greenwich council to fine local people \u00a37million (what they have budgeted to receive from ltn fines) whilst implementing ltn's. It is truly miserable living here.",

So how come you first look at distance and then not? Also if you got this social distancing rules you MUST implement your service much better because the service you provide today and saturday was orrible ...  To reach home from canning town was a nightmare and I only leave in Upton park! You need to organise more bus as the waiting time were to long also because a the end of the day we pay oyster for service but you haven't provide a good service. Every weekend there are issue on district. You could have done the job on it during lockdown when less people were around!",

Tfl point to their t&cs which basically say you cannot get a refund even if TfL reject your application\n\nDisgraceful way to treat students with limited funds, don\u2019t know of any other place with such a blatant rip off.

I was so expecting to ring up, go through 100's of telephone options, only to be stressing how I can't be helped. On the contrary! Low and behold, I rang TFL customer service, went through 2 options. My call was answered within minutes. I explained my issues, Gregger asked me all the write questions and dealt with my problem painlessly.  Wow, I just had to write this good review straight away as it's very rear I give out 5 stars.  Thank you very much Greggar for making this phone call stress free \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

        "review_text": "Complain to TFL.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19): Restrictions on bus travel for passengers.\n\nOn the 5th of May 2021 at 07:00am this was my first day going back to work due to the Coronavirus restriction isolation.\n\nThis was on the route for the 140 buses at the Target round about Northolt where after the first 3 buses i managed to get on a bus and then needed to change to get on the 114 bus   toward Burnt Oak at South Harrow and that was after 2 buses. I got to Burnt Oak at 08.40am just in time to get to work for 08.55am carrying a laptop that felt heavy. At the bus stop at Burnt Oak there was no problem to travel to the hospital because there are several buses that go past the hospital.  Before the pandemic this journey took me 40 minutes up to an hour maximum.\n\nSince i was able to make it to work by 08:55 am for a 09:00am start it was not too bad although i did get stressed because of the length of travel time [Two hours].  \n\nBecause i got to work at 08:55 on the 5th of May 2021 i thought the next day on the 6th of May 2021 that it would not be the same as the day before.\n\nSo i left home to get the bus stop at the same time. Except it was so much more worse than the day before. It was after 7 buses at 07:55 am that had gone past that i begged the bus driver to let me on by telling him i work for the NHS and that i need to get to work.  The bus driver said to me that the bus he was driving is for School Runs.  The other Buses that had gone past were the same either school runs, or they were full.  \n\nI got off the 140 bus at Lascelles Avenue Harrow to get on the 114 bus to burnt oak and again after two buses went past that i got on the 114 bus.  I normally change the bus at South Harrow or Harrow on the Hill bus stop but again i thought that there maybe be too many people waiting at these stops so it would be better to change at Lascelles Avenue Harrow.\n\nThe time it took me to get to work on the 6th was two and half hours. I was very cold, stressed and in tears thinking to myself that is this what is happening to all of us who travel on the bus?  Is this how it is going to be with the Restrictions on bus travel for passengers. On the 6th of May when i got back home i could not sleep due to the cold in my body and the foot cramps.\n\nI do understand that at the present time we are all in the same boat. But we see so many buses going past that are not full.\n\nPlease TFL help us as the government restrictions are lifting and more public will be returning to work.  \nAs the government wants more of the public to use TFL and less cars to be on the road it would help if there were more buses on the road.  Please tell me what would you suggest to help me to be able to travel to work?\n\nThank you.",

I get so annoyed with the way the congestion Charge call centres and website operate its not acceptable to be this unreliable. Londoners need the service to be working well, if the website is down. wouldn't it been reasonable for phone lines to be open. I find it really unfair seems like its being managed poorly most often. If you don't believe, me rate customer experience after a call perhaps, maybe with a simple, touch tone questionnaire  there isn't one..",

You now have to wait for the next bus which is too full to let you on, or walk. No refund obviously. \n\n- Bus asked to stop for a period of time to regulate the service. Makes sense but you then get passed by 2 buses of the same service. Surely those that left first should arrive first? Leapfrogging makes zero sense. \n\n- Santander bike docks in commuter areas too often empty or entirely full. I understand this is often due to customer usage but at least pay attention to the distribution of bikes and try to address.",

        "review_text": "Ok, so the service on all forms is transport isn't always up to scratch (delays, cancellations etc), but I recently needed to email Tfl customer services to get help resolving an Oyster card issue.  They answered quickly and, much to my surprise, followed up a week later with a call, to make sure I'd received their email, as I hadn't had the chance to reply / take action yet.  The issue took a couple of emails back and forth to resolve (purely because I'd misunderstood their initial instructions) and I received responses within 24 hours and they were always polite and helpful.  Really impressed with the online customer service team.",

The prices are very reasonable and whether I need a bus or a tube train the waits generally speaking do not seem to be long and more often than not I can find a seat but I do not mind standing too much.\n\nThe only bad points are:\n\n1) As a man of around average height (5'9\") I have had a few knocks to the head near the back of the bus when I forget to duck. However, due to my height ducking is not something I have to do that often so more headroom would be good if they ever redesign the buses.  \n\n2) One bus I was on stopped at a bus stop (reasonably enough) and then the bus driver got out without a word and disappeared. Very bizarre. There was no one waiting at the bus stop at this point. I was sitting on the bus alone for 20 minutes not knowing what I should do. In the end more passengers got on the bus and after 5 minutes longer I got off and chose to walk. However that is an isolated case.",

I live in Kennington and work in Wembley Park and am required to work on site. \nThe weekend of 24/01-25/01 - both Jubilee line and Metropolitan line have been closed. \nSaturday, I had to take the Bakerloo line to Wembley Central which is then a 15-20 minute walk away to work. Bakerloo is so slow, so I ended up getting an Uber so I wasn't ridiculously late to work. \nToday has been the absolute kicker. Both Jubilee and Metropolitan line are closed. The overground is also not running until 12pm and the Bakerloo line was shut!! \nI got to Waterloo at 7am and the man at the station advised that the first Bakerloo train would leave at 7.20am - not very helpful when I start work at 8am and have a 40 minute journey ahead of me + a 15-20 minute walk. \nI ended up tubing as far north on the trusty Northern line and then catching an Uber to work. \nHow is it that in one weeked you can have so many lines closed? I thought having Jubilee and Metropolitan shut at the same time was crazy enough but then to have Bakerloo not open until later, it's just ridiculous. \nI pay \u00a3200 a month for my travel card but this still isn't apparently enough and I'm having to supplement my travel with Ubers. \nIt would be great if the decision makers at TFL could really think about their passengers and the people that do need to make the journey from south to north.",

After numerous phone calls over a period of 5 months I was told Ivstill had to pay the \u00a3240. The staff are automatons with few manners, no listening skills, at one stage I was blatantly lied to after receiving another PCN for the same hire vehicle which had nothing to do with me. Relentlessly inefficient. Complete waste of time attempting to have any rational conversation with staff there. So they spent time and effort refunding the \u00a380 paid for the wrong PCN and issuing me with another penalty notice for \u00a3240. Sincerely hope I never have to contact this hapless organisation again.",

(YT59SFF) on 17/1/2021 at 15:33\n\nThe initial driver arrived Fulwell station at 15:34 & the African driver to take over was no where to be found.\n\nApparently he was running late, all the passengers waited patiently for his arrival, after about 5mins, finally he was sighted walking down the street on the phone, laughing & chatting away unperturbed without any sense of urgency whatsoever.\nHe got on the bus, no apologies to the passengers or hurry to make up for the wasted time, after another 5mins he would not settle down to commence the journey, when a passenger called out to him maintaining social distancing, he simply looked in the mirror & arrogantly ignored, sitting tight in sheer nonchalant lackadaisical attitude. The passenger walked up to him & explained that he should have been waiting for his colleague to hand over, but he had kept all the passengers waiting.\nIn all rudeness, he just waved his paper & said he is obviously still trying to sign in for about 10mins.\nThen he pressed the button FALSELY, claiming \"the driver had been instructed to wait\" ....the passenger told him that was clearly untrue because he was apparently running late & wasting all the passengers time without any concerns or remorse.\n\nTo prove his dictatorship, he sat tight to infuriate already exasperated passengers even more & he parked every 5mins till a bus 281 scheduled 15mins LATER passed him and still he falsely claimed his bus controller had instructed him to slow down.\n\nThese delays subsequently caused an extra 25mins lateness to the passengers trip.\nThis is an abuse of public service!\n\nThis uncouth driver utterly lacks manners, a sense of time urgency, customer service or professionalism & SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING A LONDON BUS\nHE SHOULD BE REMOVED WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT!\n\nTFL should train the drivers to be efficient, accountable & polite to passengers, not driving like they are providing a charity service to the helpless passengers waiting at their mercy.

However as lock-down continued I decided the time was right request the refund. \nMy calls went unanswered therefore I emailed and was told that I had to claim within 8 weeks of my last journey and provide proof of that journey from their website! Unfortunately their systems are not up to scratch and I was unable to do this, even a letter from my employer was not acceptable. Consequently when I requested my refund, it was calculated from July not April,  TFL UNDER refunded me approx \u00a3500.00. Utterly unfair and bad practice.  Who has money to throw away?\nWe are living in exceptional times, we have to be flexible and helpful, such a shame this doesn't extend to TFL.

Hammersmith bridge is still not repaired causing chaos in that part of London due to TFL not having the cash to fix it. Tubes run well as does the DLR most of the time.

This caused a lot of distress and I had a panic attack and immediately had to return home from my journey.\n\n I then phoned TFL and none of the operators showed me an ounce of empathy. None whatsoever. They simply told me to pay full price in the mean time. I was then told my only option to replace the card was to pay a \u00a310 admin fee, in addition to paying full price whilst I sit and wait for the replacement card.\n\nI very reluctantly did this because I had no choice. The website told me 5-7 working days from payment that the new card would be with me. Then the operator told me 10 working days. I asked why the discrepancy and was aggressively shouted at 'This is YOUR fault!! It is not TFLs fault!!'\n\nI was extremely upset by this, as I had not said that it was anyones 'fault'. and to be harassed, shouted at, and blamed when in distress was the last thing I needed when I was already feeling ill.\n\nSince paying for the replacement card, TFL have sent me no acknowledgement of payment, nothing. So I have absolutely no evidence of this should it get lost in the post. There was also no option to choose a tracked service. \n\nThis worries me greatly as royal mail have lost several books due to come to my address. \n\nThis is really terrible service and I have spent the whole day in tears feeling ill. I hope no one ever has to go through this dreadful experience.",

My bus to work was once every 10 mins which was bad enough until they added the school bus services in as every other service. I have been refused entry to the bus a few times, despite the fact that the bus is empty and the \"guidelines\" are just that! I cannot find anything on website to say it's a rule that only school kids can use the service ( and no one enforces the mask wearing regulation!!) It's really hit and miss what time the non school bus turns up and whether the driver is sensible or not! As I should be at work 15 minutes before I get there I am going to try to claim delay compensation, see if that gets their attention!",

I was on the bus for 2 and a half hours last Friday and i also have lots of work being a student and having GSCE\u2019s... the bus system is honestly terrible. Customers and members of the public are very unhappy and outraged by the service. A lady, a  fellow passenger was telling me how she turned to twitter to complain about the 533 bus and she said there\u2019s been a collective outrage on facebook about TFL. I have to wait ATLEAST half an hour every day after school and it\u2019s always dark when i get home... TFL also said there would be buses made specifically for students however i haven\u2019t seen one yet! TFL PLEASE CHANGE! GET MORE 533 BUSES!!",

They will obstruct/prevent your 13 year old them from getting on the tram with all their schoolfriends to get to their school - which is a journey that is free with the zipcard. Your child (who cannot buy a ticket - as you need a bank card, no cash) - will be left soaking in the rain, late for school. They will bully and try and intimidate the parent when they arrive at the stop to pick up their child, and ask them why they cannot show some adult discretion, give them a warning or a penalty fare, just let them get to school - that is the purpose of public transport. Disgusting Low Life - in the midst of a pandemic!. Children are vulnerable people - read your guidelines and apply them in practice. Children are not safe on TFL services, and the inspectors are revenue opportunists....you make us sick! Hopefully the falling revenues mean less inspectors preying on our children.....",

Face masks must be worn at all times and must maintain social distancing at all times\". So on your short journey of about 10 stops after this being broadcast about 15 times and sometimes 3 times before setting off people were becoming infuriated. For gods sake the people getting on the bus hadn't even had chance to sit down before the repeated propaganda messages were blaring out! Not to mention given all the window seats were taken you wanted people to sit down (right next to each other) instead of standing up - no wonder people refused - why blurt out the incessant propagdana but double overfill the bus? Please please NPS, stop this. Have you ever thought by using these incessant North Korean Propaganda style announcements that you are adding to the nation's ever increasing anxiety problems and the nation's mental health crisis!? Have any of you policy makers in TFL ever sat throughout a whole journey and endured it? I thought not.... I know TFL nearly went bankrupt, and with this for my own sanity I will now be avoiding buses were possible and using TFL so TFL are only perpetuating their own funding crisis and at the same time driving users and the population of London insane! I wouldn't expect any other reply than we are trying our best in difficult circumstances or that people need to be informed.. simples bus drivers implement face masks at passenger point of entry and don't overfill bus..",

Its just a nuisance and wastes peoples time as we have to look for a shop that does oyster.\n\nAll national rail ticket machines take cash. Govia treat customers way better than TFL ever could.",

The train should arrive at platform 1 but it stopped at platform 3 and didn't wait for the people to come and they also didn't announce nothing on the radio or something. Today, I took the TFL train from Liverpool Street to Forest Gate but the first stop where the train stopped was Romford. Nobody said nothing about this, so I was forced to go to Romford and then back to Forest Gate! This is for what we pay all this Oyster Cards? So they can do this to us? I am coming from work, I am tired, and you just don't care and you think you can do this to us like that? Shame on you! I am so angry that I cannot even make a complaint, I am to sick to waste my time with you for complaints which might lead to nothing, maybe another waste of time. If you cannot run this service then go and work in a farm or something else and let some competent rail services to do the job properly. Shame on you!",

I contacted tfl helpline to refund this error and even to try and change it to the correct vehicle or at least credit the amount for a future trip. I was abruptly informed that no refunds will ever happen and there is nothing that can be done so I would have to pay for the correct vehicle or face a PCN charge. Of course I know this was a my own fought for not entering the correct vehicle but I cannot understand why TFL do not have a sophisticated computer  system that alerts the customer that the vehicle registration hasn't used the congestion zone and therefore alerting you not to pay and to input the correct vehicle or any other errors on their website.  Conciendently, They do have a system that alerts you that your credit card has been inputted incorrectly and that you should put the right details in.  Effectively TFL have taken my money and possibly many others and still think this is an acceptable behaviour. I cannot describe my anger and frustration in their company and will not use their service where ever possible for future trips.",

        "review_text": "Went to London last year exhibit some of my sculptures I had to drive them into central London. I hardly had any money just enough to get there, exhibit and back. I had not even enough money to pay my congestion charge up front. However I was there 3 days and rather busy as I was back and forth on the bus to the exhibition. I forgot all about the charge until the day after I arrived paying it on the bus on my phone just before midnight. Phew I thought I had just done it.\n No ... a few weeks later I had a bill for none payment of congestion and ULEZ even though I had paid them they had gone through after midnight.\n So I contested it and was told then a straight no ... and now it was \u00a3160 each !! If I couldn't pay it before how could I pay this now ??\nI again sent it off to tribunal to look at it ... as I had paid it and just before midnight ; however the email back from TFL shows the payment time as 0:54... \nThis has only just come back from an independent tribunal ( from February) saying I still have to pay the fine !!! I have now been in lockdown for 3 months ... no work ... single mother on UC ?? Now I have to pay \u00a3160 again ... no heart ... ????",

        "title": "London Overground Not the Most Respectful Outfit",
        "review_text": "This is chiefly aimed at the London Overground particularly Richmond/Clapham Junction to Stratford line.  The only things good about this operator is that it is now cheaper to travel on certain journeys thanks to the integration with the tube network, and the service seems to be more frequent now off-peak when trains manage to run that is.  Other than that it has not much going for it.  The trains have the same smelly carriages, just a bit longer now, the chief reason being that the company will not open the windows to let any air in.  The doors were badly designed so that when the carriages are chock-a-block everyone\u2019s feet catches on the bottom and jam the doors.  My local station had an expensive upgrade following the announcement that the London Stadium would become home to West Ham United.  The result was a cold and uninviting carbuncle owing to the poor design by the appointed architect, who obviously seen the guinea pigs coming.  You also have to go the long way round to get into the station now with no partnership forged with the local authority over disabled access.  That was left down to me to instigate.  Despite several long-term line upgrades over the last few years there are still disruptions to the service on a regular basis.  Another inconvenience is the withdrawal of paper timetables; have you ever tried looking at a whole table on your phone?  Almost impossible.\n\nCOVID19 UPDATE: It seems the windows are still locked over what was said to be health and safety concerns.  I would imagine this allows the virus to linger in the air for longer.",

Was first told that refunds could be applied for online and that payment would go back to the original payment card. 20 days later I received an email to say that instead the money would be transferred to Web Credits and could be transferred to future Oyster cards. The email also mentioned that the Web Credits section has a feature to transfer the refund to a bank account. However 4 days later the Web Credit still registers zero balance despite the email indicating that it should have been processed within a few hours. Multiple calls to customer service totally useless.",

        "review_text": "I would say I\u2019m shocked by how much worse TFL are getting but that would be a lie. Most trains are delayed and today (Saturday) my journey has more than doubled in journey time and cost because of rail replacements.\n\nThe staff at Lewisham sent me to 3 bus stops they \u201cthought\u2019 was the replacement yet this turned out to be incorrect. After the 4th time going back to the station to advise they sent me to the wrong one yet again they just laughed and said they don\u2019t know. After a search online I found the only way home was the normal bus and then a 30min walk to get home, in;rss I wanted to take 2 buses.\n\n30mins wasted walking around and after 2hours of travelling, this laugh was NOT WELCOMED! Your staff are a joke (some of them) but your company is atrocious. If we, as commuters, could strike (refuse to pay for our journey) the transport system would shut down. Yet the staff are stricking every few months because of the service they are given.... what about us? We pay for travel yet aren\u2019t provided even close to an acceptable service.\n\nWhat do we have to do to get you to improve it, any of it. You\u2019ve changed the bus 53 route to no longer go to central so I have to now take 2 buses home if I work late at knight instead of the usual one bus (53). I have to give an extra 30mins-1hour each way because of these crappy changes and yet I\u2019m still paying more for each extra journey I have to make. An extra bus or trains costs money, it\u2019s not like I could just refuse to pay it. If only this was possible.\n\n\nWhy don\u2019t TFL pick up I the extra cost? Because they literally do not give a crap about their service, their customers, their staff... only their POCKETS! I hope they lose the contract and go into liquidation real soon. Someone else needs to take over ASAP!!",

        "review_text": "I used to think TFL were okay when they first took over the Metro Shenfield to Liverpool Street line.  Then came the plan for Crossrail.  I thought that was okay too, a new line from Essex into London, wonderful - it will take a few people off our trains and they won't be so crowded.  Then I realised it wasn't a new line, they were just joining up our old line with a new tube line under London.  As if our trains are not crowded enough, now we'll have even more people on them!  And with only enough seats on the new trains for the lucky few, most of us end up standing, crushed like sardines.  I shudder to think what would happen if there was an accident with all those people standing.  Then there's the barging and pushing on the platforms as people try desperately to get one of the few remaining seats, it won't be long before someone is pushed under a train.  But wait! TFL have the answer for overcrowding!  Just shut off the ticket barriers and stop people going down to the platform - problem solved! That's real progress for commuting in London in the 21st century isn't it? A service most of us have already paid for and they're stopping us accessing it.  Thanks TFL for really messing up what was once a fairly good train line.",

I suggested they send an email to the account holder and I would reply, thus proving I am who I say I am. They refused. So I have no other way of proving my identity as they wont do the one thing that would allow me to do so. Right now, we have a number of cards we cannot manage.

Once the requirements are met (DBS check, License check, topographical test, English test) \u00a0\nDrivers must wait indefinitely (days, weeks, months) without time frame, or service standards for a PCO license. TFL's operatives are delays due to lack of budget and short staff. But each driver is charged hundreds of pounds to finance these processes.\nNew PCO drivers are told that they are prioritize over new applications, and they will have to wait longer as they receive priority, there is no reasonable explanation of this process. amount of money.\nProcesses for TFL have been changed by TFL. Test centers were reduced massively to only 6 in London.\nAppointments to take the test, then increase the massively in time, the topographical test is left for the final stages of the application. Drivers have then 2 opportunities to pass the test. If test is ultimately failed (less than 60% pass mark) drivers will have to pay full fee again.\nResults of these tests remained unexplained. As when drivers received test results there is no break downs of the test.\nThis also brings unquestionable reasons to believe. And if the TFL should only be charged at the beginning of the test, the cost of the application will be reduced.\nIt is believing that TFL is using these delaying tactics for private hire drivers, to discourage new applicants to pursue a new license. Reduce private hire drivers and give an advantage to black cab drivers.\nCurrently, if an applicant meets the statutory eligibility criteria, TFL is legally obliged to issue a license.\nThe Mayor has called on the government to provide further legislative powers for TFL, to cap the total number of PHVs in London. The government recognizes that PHV drivers are willing to provide for their families. So, the government has been reluctant to pursue legislation and the number of PHVs, so TFL now uses an approach of lack of service, lack of transparency, lack of standards to delay the issue of these licenses.\nWE ASK YOU TO SIGN THIS PETITION AS FATHER'S NEEDING TO PROVIDE TO YOUR FAMILIES, FATHER'S THAT HAVE PAID AND COMPLIED WITH REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN WORK AND PROVIDE FOR THE LAST AND DAUGHTERS.\n- TFL must meet the requirements of a service.\n\u00a0\n- TFL must have a standard of service on all applications.\ntimeliness \naccuracy \nappropriateness\n\u00a0\nTFL must compensate for new and existing drivers.",

Than no refund. Called again. Was advised to wait longer as at that point my case was escalated. \n\n4. A couple of days later I receive an email saying that my oyster card is not registered. What an appalling service. Simply lying. I already spoke to many people and my oyster was registered. When it comes to getting a refund they say that it shows as not registered on their system. Absolutely crazy. \n\n5. Basically, stole my money by telling my wait for a long time as if I didn't wait it seems that I would have been able to call the bank and make an indemnity claim. \n\nDON'T USE OYSTER TRAVEL CARD.

By mistake, when I passed my phone at the turnstile, I have been charged with my contactless card registered on my apple pay. I called the customer service, not one or two times but, four times for getting a refund of \u00a32.90! The most ridiculous fact is that I've been passed through different teams. A typical conversation was like: \"Alright, I'm gonna send you to the contactless payment/Oyster 18+ card team\". I've been waiting for ages for someone and, for concluding at best, the system drop me the line. I'm worried about that because It has happened to me but involves thousands of people every day and that is not fair, especially when you are paying for a service that is not worth it. \nDaniele Bauducco",

I arrived at the station last week, however on my way to the escalator, I felt sick and dizzy.  I then managed to walk over to the staff at the turnstiles.  Immediately, they asked if I was ok and led me to a seat to compose myself.  Throughout my recovery, members of staff sat, comforted and spoke to me, to make sure I was ok.  After a while a felt better and Ryan made me laugh about something which made me forget about the stomach pain, completely.\nI got up 10 mins later, feeling much better.\nI just want to say how exceptional, kind and thoughtful your Staff are. \nPlease extend my thanks to the team, especially Ryan and Shakira.\nKind regards \nRachel\n25/11/2019",

Even after sending them a screen grab of the error message and the last 4 digits of the card used, they repeatedly failed to find any entry for my attempts in their log file or give me any idea what the problem might be.  I know the details I was giving for the card were correct as I used the same card to buy other things on line both before and after the TFL failure.\n\nBuying a Visitor Oyster card through their website and paying the postage is a scam anyway.  Landed at Gatwick, went to the Gatwick Express ticket office to get the train into central London, and they sold me a Visitor Oyster along with the Gatwick Express tickets without any extra charge.\n\nAfter installing the TFL app, which was a huge PITA, it informed me that I couldn't register a Visitor card.  No idea why - all I wanted to be able to do was check journey history and amount left on the card.  That information is all available online - the ticket machines at various stations could show me it - but the app wouldn't.\n\nOnce I got past this nonsense, the trains themselves were fairly reliable; a 20 minute wait for a Circle line train one morning being the only real problem.",

Their helpline just insists it's all in the intro that is few pages long. They know perfectly well that people renting a bike are in a rush or in a group and wont have time to read it.

        "review_text": "Last week I found a 60+ Oyster card (which had the full name of the owner on it). I immediately phoned TFL, who said they couldn't discuss it with me because of \"Data Protection\" - as I was not the owner of the card (!!!) - of course I wasn't the owner as I was asking them to get in touch with the owner, the details of whom they would have on file. I then asked to speak to her manager - and I was told that I couldn't because of Data Protection.  I think TFL staff need Data Protection training - as the girl I spoke to obviously didn't have a clue about data protection. I then contacted them on Facebook - no reply received and then on Twitter - who took four days to tell me to drop it in at my nearest Tube or Bus Station - I have neither remotely near me. I also contacted Customer Services by email (and gave them my phone number to pass on the the owner of the card) - who haven't bothered to respond.  The sad thing is they they could have so easily just looked up their record and put the owner of the card in touch with me and then it would all have been resolved.  This all leaves me with the impression that the recruitment criteria for TFL are (1)  Zero Common Sense and (b) must be a cretin.\n\nTFL appear to have no procedures in place for what to do when someone FINDS an Oyster card.  I was trying to do my bit in order to help someone regain his 60+ Oyster Card and to not have to pay for a replacement.  Sadly all I encountered was apathy, no-one within TFL seemed remotely interested.  I suppose they see a lost 60+ Oyster card as a nice little earner and so don't even make the slightest effort to try and contact the owner",

When we submitted refund claims only my friend got the full refund even though we did the same journey same times on the same tubes!!! The reply they gave me was, \"refunds will not show up in your bank statements but will appear as a plus\"!!!! What are they smoking at TFL?!?!?!?!? It's funny my friend got the full refund showing on their statement but mine wouldn't show up! It must be readily available cocaine available in London that TFL Customer Services must be indulging in to send me such a stupid reply! Fraud must be on a massive scale at TFL and we urge all customers to check their Contactless statements as you most probably have been overcharged which is Fraud as they refuse to refund customers that check their statements!",

        "review_text": "I was treated disgustingly by some rubbish staff at London bridge. Firstly, the machine took my money without topping my oyster up. There weren't any staff at new cross gate so I got on a train one stop to London bridge and encountered a woman called Natasha. I told her my story and she looked at my oyster journey on the machine it for her to misunderstand. I made the journey TO new cross 2 hours ago. Now I was tryi5to reverse the journey to go home. She called me fake, a liar and said she knew it immediately when she first saw me. Another male member of staff was there and he was just as unhelpful and refused to answer any questions I asked him. He said I was twisting his words and making racist insults at him. After over an hour if trying to plea my case and even members of public tried to talk to her, only for her to laugh in their faces, a supervisor called Nathaniel came out. He said he wasn't going to talk to me unless I calmed down, but I was hysterically angry at this point because of the ordeal I was put through. Then Natasha started to shout at me, and I shouted back at her to not do that, had Nathanial restrain me with his arm across my shoulder and then he called the police\n The police arrived and said it wasn't a police matter. But I still had to them them the situation, give my full details to them and eventually, 3 hours after getting to London bridge, I got home. Disgusting. I emailed TFL to complain. This was on the 13th September. I still haven't heard anything back.  I rang the next day to get my \u00a35 back and the woman gave me an additional \u00a310 because I told her what had happened. I'm still shocked by the situation though, and sad that there isn't a faster way to get this sorted.",

I had been charged the maximum fare for a journey to Richmond. But I always tap in and out (even when the gates are open) and sometimes, the machines do play up. But Steven looked into my dispute and has arranged for a refund. 5 stars for this.\n\nOne thing I would like to see is TfL compensating customers for delayed journeys automatically or by sending alerts or questionnaires about journeys for which there has been major disruption in between 2 given stations. I have had a few majors delays between Clapham Junction and Chiswick to and mainly fro, where trains were just cancelled one after another and I was fully charged but wasted valuable hours waiting at Chiswick or Barnes station. Hence 1 star for this.\n\nAverage of 3 stars!!!",

Then in September (4 months later) they resent me the fine telling me I need to pay. So in remembering I already paid the fine I went to check my account to verify that no refund had been processed and nope, no refund and yes, my initial payment had gone out. So I wrote to them about it and after about a week I received a response which was basically saying the money was refunded to me and I needed to pay it back. I then went to check my account again and only 3 days before getting their response (a week after I received the letter saying I still need to pay 4 months after I did pay) I see they processed a refund. So basically what seems to have happened is they sent me this 2nd PCN (possibly in error or more possibly on purpose to try scam me) after I replied to them telling them I had paid it and no refund had been issued they realised their error and in an effort to justify their mistake refunded me the money  now telling me i need to pay them back in 14days or the fine will be increased. Is this company the countries biggest organised crime syndicate second to Westminster itself or are they all just a bunch of potato heads who have more eyes than they have brain cells? This is an obvious scam whereby they refund your fines and hope you don't repay it in time so they can charge you increased fees. If I was abroad for more than 2 weeks as I am 2 or 3 times a year when this happened I would have been screwed and would have had to pay their increased amount.

Firstly TfL\u2019s staff are particularly wholesome, they take pride in ripping your money out of you even when you\u2019ve been legally using the service correctly for several years. They each come  smartly dressed in their terribly tamed beards and scruffy dirty outfits as well as the fact that they never learnt how to have a conversation without the help of a megaphone. Next the service they provide is 100% unreliable, I would recommend that you add about 20% extra onto your journey time in order to be prepared for all of the delays you should expect. Each of these services are slow and executed as if the driver is trying to have a laugh at you.

Turns out this is a scam and TFL did not receive the 19.99 that I paid to Paylondoncharges. I get that I have been ripped off and there is nothing that TFL can do however I do feel that as I have proof that I have paid and I provided TFL with the receipt. They should now be asking me to pay the 12.50 charge not pursuing me for \u00a380 which is the fine that you get charged if you blatantly ignore their signs and don't make any attempt to pay.\nTFL point out in their Notice of rejection of my appeal that they  have many signes warning us that we are entering into ULEZ. Yes we know this that is why we paid the charge. Maybe the precious signs should also state where to pay the charge !!!",

I ask the lease company to fight the fine. They are good about it. I collect all the information I have and check the PCN online again as my appeal was through their website. I then find 2 more pictures that would not show before (Funny That!) I can see they have a point and would like to pay the fine. But they have put it on hold from my appeal (Not the registered Keeper) but they cannot take it off appeal as I am not the registered keeper to let me pay the fine. \n\nGet your act together just because you are a large organisation does not mean you can just do as you like. Every time I phone they will not even talk to me as I am not the registered keeper just the person that leases the vehicle and drives it. Yet they can write to me!!! What a shambles.",

They SHOULD have collect enough money by now to catch the scam like this or warn better, as Paylondoncharge came up at the first place in Google. In my honest opinion obviously there must be a relationship between these two and when there is not enough people has been found, TFL makes sure the website appears up on Google again in the first place. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. Anyone is up for a petition or something to fight or stop them? For me \u00a3130 is worth it not to allow and keep TFL to do whatever they want to do.

We don\u00b4t want to hassle more with worker and decide to take the trip... \n\nWe get there and the machine is out of order.... so we lost 5 pund plus the remain money on the card (7 pund) each. Even when we asked for direction we were meet with the worst service.\n\nService: SCORE: -5 This is everything from customer service to their network of transportation. Constant maintenance in rush hour  is a hassle for the customer.\n\nTrains, Busses, Tram: SCORE: 3 can get crowd but that is expected for a capital city with millions of people.\n\nIf you want to use public transportation... don\u00b4t! find a hotel in the centrum and avoid it or mix it with the hop on and off tour busses.",

Train says it is going to Morden via Bank, platform staff say we think it is going to Kennington via Charing cross. Driver says nothing whatsoever. So I'm clueless to where the train is going and so are fellow passengers.\n6. Left job cos of it. Asked for season ticket refund to my bank account. 20 minutes again on the phone. Will take 6 days to respond via email. So you can take my payment within a few hours but refunds take weeks!\n7. Asked for a manager to call back. Was told it would be evening of Wednesday 10th. Friday 12th and still no phone call.\n8. Ask to speak with a manager and I get nowhere. Offered \u00a325 compensation as a gesture of goodwill and promised a manager call back after call recordings are listened to.\n\nFrustrating that I have to wait for a refund when payment is taken within a day.

Yes, we pay the most for the transport but we get more than anyone else too. Too bad that we can review each line individually because Central line is simply the worse. \nWith what we have, I think the tfl is doing pretty good and I believe they are customer oriented and not profit driven. If anyone check tfl financial statements they would know that tfl is loosing LOADS for not increasing prices in the last few years. Yes, there are things that could change without investments and that would on-site station staff who aren't the kindest or bothersome for the most part. Crowd control isn't the best but I don't see how it can improve. People complain about trains being packed but they don't offer solutions - there is no solution. When you get a packed train and the next one is 1min away also packed - you should know that they can't put an extra train because it's already coming every minute. Keep in mind that there is over 10m people in public transport every day and yes, it will suck. \nBuses on the other side, for most rides I had the worst experience and it makes you wonder who gives the licence to most of those drivers. I don't need them to smile and be polite (as most are not) but I need them to be a good driver. Most bus rides makes me nauseus and I feel that drivers are being inconsiderate of standing passengers.",

It's like excuse me, what are you talking about? (no rwfund for that by the way, still working on it, been over a month)\n\ntrains, bus and customer service the whole package is pile of feces, especially for the price, THE MOST EXPENSIVE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICE IN THE WORLD!!!! and we the customer get nothing out of it, not even a decent service, SHAME on you TFL, you disgust me with your practises",

The destination also changed from Stratford to Canonbury and then Hackney wick all with in ten minutes. The most frustrating part though was looking at the screen waiting 13 out of 15 minutes for the train to arrive and then it beingq cancelled. This happend four times which is unacceptable to paying customers and calls in to question the competence of TFL rail. Especially since my experience is reiterated in most of the reviews written on this page that are entered pretty regularly.

        "title": "a young black woman gets shooketh by the help of two white men",
        "review_text": "Saturday 08/12/2018\n\nI left my purse on the bus after a long day of work and got off at the last bus stop on the 320 bus route, Catford Bridge. When I went into my pocket to get my purse I didn't find it, I checked every pocket in my bag, my jacket, my work apron at least 3 times. I then came to the realisation that I must have fallen out of my pocket when I was sitting on the bus. So I looked around to find the rest stop of the 320 bus and ended up following another 320 bus all the way there. Being a young, black woman, one who happened to be wearing a headwrap because this English weather is really testing my type 4 hair (meaning most people think I'm Muslim so that's another 'reason' for ignorant people to discriminate against me), I had already made my mind up that I wasn't going to get my purse back as I assumed if the bus driver wasn't another minority they would just shoo me away. So you can imagine how scared I was when I saw that the bus driver was a 6ft 4 older white male. However, I never been so shocked in my life. Not only did Stuart, the bus driver, phone up his superiors and make every feasible contact he could, he assured me that everything was going to be ok. He was able to get into contact with the bus driver of the bus I had taken, this other bus driver checked the bus and found my purse! Stuart then let me get on the bus for free and drove me all the way to the bus stop where the other driver was waiting with my purse, he even gave me a free travel voucher just in case my oyster card had be drained (we talked the entire journey about life, the fact that I'm in uni and he said he wouldn't want his daughter to be stranded because she's in uni). When I got to the bus stop where the driver was waiting what I didn't expect was another older, white male waiting outside in the cold for the 30 min journey it took us to get there waiting with my purse! I thanked both guys and wished them all a Merry Christmas. So I promised as a token of my gratitude, that I would write a review for my Christmas Angels, John and Stuart, they challenged my own pre-conceptions of white people, men and bus drivers and made me reconsider my own contempt for a lot of humanity. Everyone always likes to point out the negatives in life but it's times like this, when two kind people went out of their way to help a young, tired woman that make you realise that maybe all the awful stuff happening in the world hasn't completely doomed us. I want people to realise that we need to be kind to each other, because going out of your way to help others is the greatest gift you can give anyone.\n\nBIG UP MY GS STUART AND JOHN, YOU MAN WERE ABSOLUTE LADS <3",

        "review_text": "I am disgusted and in shock after a phone call i had with an agent who goes by the name of amelia haywood. This agent was rude and in her aproach to my fraustration showed absolutely no empathy during the call and blantantly could not wait to get me off of the phone on friday evening leading to her breaching data protection which to me is very serious. \n\nI called to pay my congestion charge fine and had to do it before 8pm it was around 7.45pm i had little time left and had already attempted to do it 6/7 times with no joy and was getting a little fraustrated which is understandable. \n\nI told her of my frautration and\nShe hung up the phone after trying to tell me how to speak. I was not agressive nor loud. \n            Then to my surprise. When i called back and was on the phone to another agent.  Just as he asked for my details she proceeded to shout out in the background is that ---------!! (shouting out my name in the background) breaching data protection and totally unprofessional. The agent i was talking to agreed that this was out of order. After paying the \u00a380 fine to the automated service i waited on the phone to speak to someone who could launch the complaint, i got through to a chap called Andrew who was clearly sticking up for his colleague and brushing off the fact that she broke data protection, but that was not my concern i wanted to complain.. during my call to andrew i could hear a female voice laughing not once not twice quite a few times and i pointed this out to him, his reply was very unprofessional and it was really fraustrating me even more. No way could the person in the background be having that much fun on the phone to a customer being that it is a fine payment service and not a comedy club! it happened the whole way thought the 30minute call. Half way through the call I told Andrew that i am now forced to record the rest of the call due to bad practice and unprofessional behaviour from his colleague in the background he did not object to this. It was as though she was listening in to the call and laughing at what i was saying which i found very immature. So Instead of rising to it and getting more angry i told Andrew i was recording the call and to get a manager so i could speak to him/her, he replied there is no manager here and said he will get one to call me back within 48hours...   \n\nNever in all my years of calling any company have i experienced what i experienced today on the phone this is wrong on all levels yes it is friday and yes im sure amelia wanted to go home asap but you still have to carry out your duties up until 8pm in a professional manor and show empathy if a customer is a little fraustrated. Clearly she is not customer service material im surprised and shocked.",

Every person who works for tfl and is making a strike should be fired immediately. QPR service is useless, they just stand and chat, I never had a help from them, when I asked, but I had situation that one of them called me a 'f**ing client' in my face when he wasn't able to solve my problem. I hate this company so much, so I'll start to use a bicycle from next month. TFL sucks, treats his passengers like a cattle, I feel like my grandmother who was in train to the german extermination camp, when you struggle to catch a breath in this crowded busses and tubes every single day. That's madness! But to rise a prices of tickets they're very keen but quality of service is rubbish, even worse. RUBBISH! 1 star is too much!",

The worst one is when I tried to buy a months 1-4 travel card tried it and it failed so tried it again it failed tried new machine it failed called a member of staff they try it failed was allowed through got to the other end staff wanted to fine me for not having a ticket charged me \u00a310 in the end, started to go mental at this point went to guy in ticket office explained what happened and he said what do you expect me to do about it. I lost it wanted to fight him as I checked my account they took 4 lots of travel card money almost \u00a3800 has come out of my account and having to deal with the most rude staff ever. It took days to get all my money back and every time I spoke to them on the phone just got me more wound up as they were thinking I was not telling truth. The latest time is tried to top up an oyster by \u00a320 machine timed out and they took money, literally do not bother ringing I rang 5 times got told loads of rubbish. Until i complained on twitter then I got some help but still Its been almost 3 weeks and they have not refunded the money now put a claim in with the bank so hopefully the money will come back. Another time tried to top up it failed twice at least with that time i got my money back on my oyster quickly. Basically the best way to top up your oyster is at a local shop DO NOT DO IT ANY OTHER WAY! as eventually you will get stung.",

When he came to check my ticket/pass, he was shown my blue Oyster card. He asked where the accompanying discount card was. I told him that I left it at home.  From there he asked me my name and address which I wrote on a small notebook he gave me. My blue Oyster card was valid with credit lasting to 16 May 2018. After he acquired my name, address and date of birth he started to make all inquiries about my Oyster card to someone he was talking to on a phone. I assumed that he uncovered that I was indeed holding an oyster card whose details matched with the information I gave him. Unfortunately, I was wrong and have received an unfounded Penalty Fare Notice letter from TfL which is intimidating me to pay \u00a340 before 29/05/2018 and \u00a380 after this date. The badge number of the inspector: LB3607.",

On top of this, busses are randomly cancelled, diverted, impossible to get a seat into on certain routes at some hours - this reapeating every single day of the year with no improvement brought into the service since 5 years. And yet you are still expected to pay for the journey. Can say these ones are a good business for TFL: a smoky bus from the 20th century jammed with god knows how many people all paying 1,5\u00a3 is a great affair for a compagny! It takes on average 45 minutes for this exciting journey to take me 4 miles away from home. Extremely unwelcoming staff with no clue of basic politeness and utterly inert about the issue \u00ab\u00a0uh no I ain\u2019t got a clue how to complain ma\u2019am\u00a0\u00bb. Have also heard stories about some bus drivers sniffing coke before the service which makes them on top of this lack of common sense and politeness unefficient and dangerous. Poor poor service.

To my amazement.\n\nI would like to say a big thank you to both Roni and Asma\u0131t. It would not have been possible without them.\n\nTFL should be honoured to have staff like this.

        "review_text": "Either this bus arrived at least 8minutes late or the previous bus departed early from the bus stop I boarded at.  I was at the stop at my usual time.  Given the bus was late, two arrived at the same time.  Upon boarding bus there was no alert from driver that other bus be boarded instead as this is a 'SLOW' bus. Driver drove bus slowly, definitely not more than 25miles per hr, if that.  He appeared to wait for traffic lights to turn red before joining lane of traffic, stopping at bus stops without request from aboard the bus [ringing of bell] or the bus stop [no one there].  When he stopped bus at obviously closed [yellow notification with black writing] bus stop, I approached him to clarify reason for his actions.  He then told me he was following instruction to 'even out' the service.  All well and good, TFL but not at the expense of commuter's time.  Especially when commuter allows sufficient time and pays for the service in advance of using it!  It is ever more noticeable that since the introduction of 'pay before you use' Oyster TFL public transport treats the commuter [the financer of the service] as irrelevant.",

Why is it that the other branch of the Northern Line has plenty of bus support (even all the way into central London?)",

No burn. No death. The only spark was the very small ignition driving the very limited intelligence of the TFL operative. If there is a serious emergency then my current belief is that TFL staff will create more of a danger with their presence.  Thank God for Uber. \n\nTfL. You rarely miss a chance to be rude.

        "review_text": "A Bus tried to drive me out of my lane in busy traffic. I had nowhere else to go as there was oncoming traffic in the other lane. Despite this, the bus continued to pull out into my lane. I had to stop my car to prevent a collision but the driver continued to pull out, scraping along the side of my car. I signalled repeatedly with my horn but I believe the driver only stopped because the traffic lights had turned red. My partner got out of the car & told the driver he had crashed into the side of my car. The driver responded in a confrontational manner & then drove off. I contacted the police & informed them of what had taken place. I later contacted TFL & informed them of the incident. This happened in May/June 2016 & I have heard nothing back. Thankfully no one was hurt in the incident. The scary thing is, I normally have my 1 year old & 2 year old in the car with me, & my car has signs that state that I have Children on board. I am just grateful that they were not in the car on this occasion. I have a complaints reference number. I also have a reference number for my police report as well as photos of the damage to my car. I also have photos of the bus pressed up against my car.",
