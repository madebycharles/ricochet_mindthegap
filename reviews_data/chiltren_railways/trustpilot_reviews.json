He advised of train timings, to look out for him, where to queue etc.\n\nWhen we arrived after the game he met us, took us down in the lift, told us where to stand for the wheelchair access, collected a ramp for the wheelchair, phoned ahead to the train to advise that we would be using a ramp and then helped us get our friend on to the train.

The 15:54pm train got as far as Warwick Parkway, when we were told there was a problem, and it had to crawl to Leamington Spa, I could have walked quicker. We were then told the windscreen wipers were broken, so we were off loaded (by the way it was not even raining). I then had to wait for the third train of the day which was the 16:49pm which was overcrowded, and I had to stand all the way to London, I am 63. I arrived 2.45 hours later at 18:26pm instead of 16:46pm. I put a complaint to Chilternrailways, and requested a refund. Chilternrailways have given me a derisory \u00a312 refund, and do not seem particularly bothered by what happened! \n",

The passengers finally settled on the opposite platform, but then the train at 5:30pm arrived at the original platform again, and people had to run towards the original platform to catch that train. The staff had no clue before giving instructions and the experience was incredibly unpleasant.",

The journey is 1hr 20 and there are no plugs or tables available, not even folding ones on the back of the seats. The trains are regularly crammed, everyone is uncomfortable. The seats are tiny and the legroom negligible (and I\u2019m quite short!). These trains would be fine for short journeys but it\u2019s insane that they are used for journeys of over an hour. \n\nGiven that the company do own and run better/newer trains, I cannot understand why they want their passengers to be miserable. \n\nChiltern rail is just the most awful way to travel.

On some other trains that would actually be a problem but these are walk through so for most , simple , just walk through. I looked at the accessible one near the end of the journey (think we'd just left Dorridge , around 100 miles from London) . Was clean and everything .\n\nNote that boarding in Leamington Spa / Warwick was absolute chaos . I think extra dwell time at Leamington Spa is needed , even if this means some calls have to be removed  on this departure . \n\nI also found all staff to be polite and friendly\n\nEDIT: This ride ended up being free because another train company cancelled onward trains .(isn't Chiltern's fault!)",

So many signal failures, points issues in between strike action. Not sure if this is a new policy but if have purchased a ticket from a station office/machine you now have to waste your time claiming a refund directly from the station you purchased from. All well and good but most of the time I travel at weekends so no staff from CR are on duty\u2026 Basically if you have to use CR, always buy on a credit card so you can easily do a chargeback via your bank rather bother with 4 forms and countless emails.",

It drives me crazy will move from the area just because I hate riding with them. Wifi does not work, and mostly they are trains with 2 carriages. Whould not recommend this line to terrorist let along working people.  \n\n\nThe prices does not reflect the services provided.",

        "review_text": "Awful experience! Caught the 16.18 service from Marylebone to Oxford yesterday 19 December. Just after leaving Marylebone, the driver announced that one carriage had smoke in it, but not to worry it was probably just from the engine, due to poor maintenance and that he\u2019d stop unscheduled at Wembley to check. He stopped, checked, we heard no more.\nThen the lights went out in the front carriage. It was pitch black outside. I alerted the driver through the door into his cabin. He stopped unscheduled again, checked, and continued. The lights went on briefly. The driver announced that the lights and air conditioning in the front carriage would probably go off again, and that he had no headlights! The lights went off. It was pitch black.\nWe arrived at Oxford over 20 minutes late. Shocking customer service from Chiltern Railways! It has really declined since Arriva took it over - lots of cancellations, terrible overcrowding, and now serious maintenance and customer safety issues!",

Getting there in the morning, the train was reasonably full but seating was available. Coming back was a totally different story. The six o'clock service from Marylebone to Birmingham service was already jam packed at Marylebone with passengers from the London Marathon. Passengers getting on at subsequent stations were treated like sardines as the aisles were already full to capacity. The next train would have been full with football supporters and also the rest of the London Marathon attendees, I shudder to think how the service would have coped with that! I got off at Banbury and the train was still overcrowded with more people people adding to the crush. I suspect that most passengers were going to continue their journey by changing trains at Birmingham. I understand that it is difficult to gauge capacity however common sense should have prevailed and either extra trains or carriages should have been provisioned. Must try harder....",

It used to be a really good service, particularly compared to Worst Great Western, which I was previously using.  However, over the past years, I think since it was taken over by Arriva, it's slowly deteriorated - short trains, late trains, over-crowded trains, trains which aren't called until the last minute at Marylebone and Oxford so a whole trainload of passengers trying to get on at the same time.  So in the past week or so - a massive delay on a Friday with a broken down train at High Wycombe, a long delay on Weds last, last night (2nd Dec) the 18,18 nearly  half an hour late - this morning the 07.25 from Oxford Parkway only four carriages due to a train fault - so rammed.  All for the princely sum of nearly \u00a36k a year???!",

        "review_text": "I have to agree with the majority of other comments. Yesterday (10th May) I caught the 07.30 Aylesbury to Marylebone train. Despite the automated station announcement and electronic displays stating that it would have four carriages there were in fact two. On departure from Stoke Mandeville every seat was taken and from Great Missenden there was barely any standing room. The platform at Amersham was crowded (the train was scheduled to run non stop to Marylebone so obviously a popular service for commuters) but it was impossible for anyone to get on the train due to the crush. The driver was very apologetic and said there was a shortage of stock due to an earlier breakdown. To be honest, even four carriages would have been nowhere near enough. Most trains on Chiltern Railways are far too short and the Class 165 units are horribly cramped with their ridiculous 2+3 seating and virtually no legroom. Also the Aylesbury to London service is no faster than it was 60 years ago and is being slowed still further with the new timetable! Another problem is at Marylebone, where platform numbers are not announced until a few minutes before departure, followed by the inevitable mad rush to the train, which is usually at the far end of the platform. All this for the extortionate fares being charged....almost \u00a320 for a single journey of 38 miles. Not good enough.",

All trains are shorter than they used to be. It is almost impossible to get a seat on any of the principal commuter services. On many occasions, the overcrowding is simply dangerous and it\u2019s difficult to believe they are actually allowed to do this. The service has been particularly hit by industrial action in the last 6 months. The upper deck of the car park has been closed off for several years awaiting demolition because it\u2019s unsafe - yet everyone is still expected to park underneath this apparently unsafe structure. Trains are dirty and seating etc hasn\u2019t been upgraded in at least 10 years. \n\nIf you are looking to move to the area and the commuter line is a big part of your thinking, think again.",

Yes, the line is busier while the bridge at Didcot Parkway is being repaired and everyone from the Oxford via Reading to Paddington service uses the Marylebone line. But why oh why does Chiltern Railways like to 'play' with us passengers by constantly putting on two or four carriages for busy journeys? Am on the 2307 train from London Marylebone and people are sitting on the floor because some geniuses put on two carriages for the last train of the evening. We've missed events because of this maddening two carriages policy and ensuing safety issues on the journey. One journey was delayed by 50mins, less than the 60mins+ delay required for a full refund. We were offered a \u00a35 refund, after paying \u00a340+ for tickets. Nothing of course for \u00a390 in tickets to a play we were travelling to see that we were not allowed in for because our train was delayed by 50mins so we arrived at the door too late. Every journey now involves people sitting on the floor, standing or feeling faint due to overcrowding. There's got to be a better way. Please for the love of God can you stop putting on just two carriages during busy times. And stop saying 'thank you for travelling with Chiltern Railways...'. We don't have a bloody choice do we? I would suggest nationalising the service but am unsure if the government can be trusted to do any better...",

Ageing and frequently short formed and poorly maintained trains that have damaged seats or interior panels hanging off (to a level it damages your clothing or air conditioning fails and pours water on you), insufficient cleaning, poor communication during delays, detached management and customer services, and high fares that cannot possibly be justified given all of the above.\n\nWas once abandoned for two hours on a platform during winter after they cancelled our service part way. Provided no available ongoing transport other than to pay for own taxi and no communication on how to get home.\n\nChiltern just seem to be running the clock until the end of the franchise. Avoid if you can.\n\nUpdate on damaged clothing (13/12/19): \n\nChiltern will only deal with the claim if I post them my only coat in the dead of Winter and they refuse any flexibility on this (such as my offer to bring the coat into a station for inspection of the damage). No apology offered, and a complete lack of empathy from customer service.",

As I got off at the station there were a line of ticket inspectors waiting and asking for my ticket, I nicely pulled up my ticket and the man asked to see my railcard, I pulled out my railcard and didn\u2019t realise it said it had expired, he asked me when it expired and it was only 6 days ago, I offered to pay the full fare (which was \u00a35) and he said he was going to charge me instead, it was very humiliating and completely unreasonable for such an honest mistake that a loyal customer has made. I\u2019m shocked at how they bullied me into paying their ridiculous fee. Perhaps this isn\u2019t so much to do with railcard but just the unhelpful chiltern railways staff who were very rude and hardly gave me any chance to talk about the money I\u2019ve just wasted on them.

The train was initially delayed until 1439 and then as usual just disappeared off the phone app. At 1455 a guy stood next to me went over the footbridge to the ticket office and when he came back he said he'd been told that the train was just delayed. \nWind forward another half an hour and still no train so after checking the app and finding that the 1533 train was also going to be delayed I went to the ticket office to ask for a partial refund on my return ticket as I was already late and going to have to get a taxi. The reply was \"Did you pay by card?\" To which I answered yes and was told \"Oh, you'll have to telephone to get a refund.\" I didn't even get a telephone number as he went on to serve someone else! I would desperately urge anyone thinking of travelling by this method to think again. I paid to stand on a freezing platform for over an hour for nothing to then have to give up and pay for a taxi on top of the train fare. By the way, this isn't the first time and the lady stood next to me on the platform also had to leave to get a cab after waiting over an hour!\nI noticed the ticket office staff wore a body camera, I presume in case they were mistreated, but it doesn't surprise me in the slightest that they have to do so as the service given by Chiltern Railways is shoddy at the best of times and probably drives customers to be abusive.

When she booked the weekend with her sister some weeks ago there was a warning on the CR site that maintenance work was going on that day and that a portion of the return leg of the journey would be provided by bus.  Not ideal but she didn't want to change the dates and the end result should just have been a longer journey time.\nIn the event when they turned up at Stratford-Upon-Avon station they found the station locked up and a number of passengers wandering about trying to find someone to help.  Eventually someone managed to contact CR on their 'help' line and was told \"We don't have any buses and we don't intend to provide you with transport\" adding that it was her own fault for trying to travel on a maintenance day !\nNothing more to add - this is a railway company with a serious lack of leadership and customer service. I have resolved to avoid traveling with them at all costs in the future.",

The final straw for me is the response to the cancelled strike on 7 November 2022. I can understand that Saturday 5 November was difficult; the strike was called off at short notice. BUT, surely three days later the managers at Chiltern can do better than 'one train an hour Marylebone to Banbury and no trains north of Banbury'. I regularly travel Leamington to London and prefer to take the train, but this is not a joke. Get a grip; clean up the trains, get some modern rolling stock on the line and enough of it, and get organised so that you don't have to cancel 90% of a day's trains when you've had three days to fix it. I'm giving two stars for the cheerful service by station staff who work for this organisation; zero stars for the management and owners.",

I have used trains from Marylebone to Birmingham and Stratford regularly for more than twenty years. The Stratford service is suddenly of poor quality: cramped seating and very slow journey times. The Conductor on Saturday was most interested in harassing passengers to pay more money even when their connecting trains were cancelled. Our own train was being delayed so that another delayed Chiltern train could overtake us. No grace or sympathy at all. Is he on commission for onboard sales?\n\nHe did explain that most of the Club trains have been diverted to the Oxford route. These used to be a major part of what made travelling on this service a pleasure. Perhaps we need competition on the Leamington/Stratford service too: the trains were packed in both directions, so the business is there.",

Why ???? Why can\u2019t I change it from the app? That\u2019s why there is an option there. \nWhat\u2019s the point of having a railcard for cheaper tickets if you are asked to pay extra cause of their new timetable???\nWhat on earth is that ?\n\nPlus, I could have wait, no problem, but I was going to see my mum which she is in the hospital- mentioned this twice.

        "review_text": "Today\u2019s experience...\nBicester Village Station is my local station which serves Bicester and the local rural community of which I am. I turned up again today to catch a train just before 11:30 and once again NO WHERE TO PARK. The station was never ever built with enough parking and is there only to serve the Chinese/Japanese Bicester Village visitors.  If you are not one of the 7 - 7:30 London commute crowd you can\u2019t hardly ever park. The impact if you want to go to Oxford is that you then drive, Oxford if you know are clearly trying to keep car pollution away. Anyhow not being able to park I then went to Bicester North to get my London train. After fitting traffic I arrived parked and went to get a ticket for travel and parking. As the train I wanted arrived I went to the empty ticket desk to get the tickets as I thought it would be quicker than the machines, wrong, I was told I can only get the parking ticket from the machines. I chose a machine which is touch sensitive, I tapped next customer, tapped again and again and again, absolutely nothing. I waited for the adjacent machine and guess what the train went. Eventually got tickets and and additional wait for over 30mins that I shouldn\u2019t have had. So all in all the 10 minute drive into Bicester to catch a train on time turned into over and hour event.\nTo add insult to injury Chiltern railways have put up all there prices (Arrivia) but facilities and service isn\u2019t going the same direction at the same pace, even though they have put notices up saying the price increases are for investment in better services. They are also changing off peak reduction times in there favour to create a bigger peak time window.  I suspect the senior managers, board of directors and share holders wages, bonuses and returns on investment don\u2019t suffer the same lack of progression.\nChiltern railways have known about Bicester Village parking issues since the Station was opened as it is always a problem.",

Introduction of an hourly fast running service would be practical and benefit many, however the timetable is never rescheduled to meet the needs of the paying public.\n\nThe line and trains have not been updated for a significant period of time, and trains are often slow running behind their scheduled arrival times and are frequently late during the evenings.",

It was a hot day and my Mum and l were waiting at Oxford Parkway station platform  to travel in to London and had forgotten to buy a drink for the trip . One of the staff at the station must have overheard say this to each other because as l was walking back towards the ticket barrier to get a drink from the cafe , a young man approached me with 2 bottles of water. This was a very kind and thoughtful gesture. Way above the call of duty . Thank you",

We then were conducted to the station after this one by another terminating train. First stop was at Denham Golf Club, and then we were conducted to the next one that was Gerrads Cross.\n\nBy the time we got there, the fastest option to get to Stratford would take 3+ hours and comprise three different trains, implying we would lose our commitment there.\n\nTherefore, we decided to go back to London, and even then CR personnel was unhelpful to aid us to get the correct service to Marylebone.\n\nAlthough staff at London Marylebone assured us we would be reimbursed for the tickets and any other expenses incurred in the journey, that's not what happened.\n\nCustomer service was very slow to respond, and said they would not compensate us for the expenses incurred in the journey, which were caused by the fact that I had a trip planned that did not occur.\n\nFurthermore, I had other issues in relation with the missed appointment that I didn't even take into account, although I should.\n\nAre you going to do anything?",

Booked advanced tickets from Birmingham to London, had always previously booked with Virgin but Chiltern were irresistibly cheap so I booked with them. Damn should have stayed with Virgin. The train was filthy, so so so filthy. Food on the seats, suspect stains on the tables and this was a morning train - what on Earth went on! Dread to think what an evening train would be like. On the return journey we wanted to catch an earlier train and because we\u2019d booked an advanced ticket we couldn\u2019t do that without paying over \u00a340 per person for a new ticket inc a \u00a310 admin fee. I understand that it\u2019s their policy - it\u2019s a dumb policy as the trains were not full or anywhere near being full and we only wanted the hour earlier train which was in the same price bracket (Super off peak) so personally I don\u2019t know why they couldn\u2019t have just let us on for the sake of just being a good person but that isn\u2019t what annoyed me it was how RUDE the customer service woman was. As soon as we asked to change our tickets she acted like we\u2019d asked for upgrade and a bottle of champagne. She reeled off a bunch of script and shrugged her shoulders as if she doesn\u2019t get paid enough to care. We spent the hour wait having a Nando\u2019s where we received 10x the quality of customer service. I will never be sold by cheap tickets again, it\u2019s not worth it in the end.",

Their website randomly changes tickets times you selected to random other times before the final step! \nThen they refused to amend the tickets on the phone despite tickets being amendable on the confirmation. Only amendments i was offered was to buy new tickets or pay \u00a310 admin charge! the actual tickets were only \u00a314 but i am so shocked at the service i had to write and share about this. I actually recorded a video showing what their website doing is their error not mine, but i was told its my fault because i didn't check the 5th confirmation page for the 5th time! who expects the already selected and checked and confirmed and reconfirmed tickets to then randomly be changed for no reason? NOT ME clearly! the company is a joke. i rather walk then travel with them again. i will buy new tickets elsewhere, Chiltern, enjoy the money you have taken for your error!",
