I had to climb out holding on, pulling wheelchair onto platform after throwing handbags out first. Wheelchair ended up upside down,  damaged wheel alignment, injured hand and shoulder in the process. On platform trying to upright wheelchair someone in high viz said \"did you book\"( which I had done) he walked away without helping me upright chair and get back in it saying he would \"get someone\". By the time they arrived I had got myself back in wheelchair but no apology etc i explained about hurting my arm and hand in process expecting an injury report but again nothing. On return journey again at Reading no assistance/ramp etc buffet staff got me off using internal trolley ramp. Left on platform in pain dealing with a wheelchair not running properly from previous incident, heavy luggage on back. Finally found railway person after long wheel. He was aggressive and abusive, his response to no ramp etc \"no one told me\". Initially refused to help. I told him my connecting train was still in station  he was insisting late at night I wait an hour for a different connection. He spoke to me like I was an imbecile for asking to get on my original connection. Gave me a lecture about not being frustrated by his lack of help wasting more time. Absolute disgrace. Left in pain, stressed, shaking all the way to Oxford with a broken wheelchair. Thanks GWR. As usual I have reported it but Passenger Assist just does not improve and is not fit for practice",

The trains were clean and comfortable and every member of staff that I encountered was friendly and helpful. It was an absolute treat to have a buffet service (operated by yet another friendly and helpful member of staff). Seats are bookable and there is a helpful light system to indicate which seats are booked and where exactly they are booked to and from. Tickets were not expensive either although to be fair I used splits. I understand that we all have different experiences but mine could not have been more different from the negative reviews that I have seen below.

Told I could only travel on a train either immediately before or after original journey even though LNER let you get on any train you can. Submitted a claim through the national train delay scheme for an almost 2 hour delay to a journey travelling with 2 children. This was rejected by GWR as I travelled on a later train. The compensation is meant to be for delay and clearly states you can travel on an alternative train if you're able to.  On top of this, when  I submitted an appeal, they bizarrely cut the compensation they said I'd be entitled to by \u00a340. Nearly \u00a3200 for a journey on a crammed train with no seats and no trolley service to at least try to distract children because it couldn't get through the crowds \n\nTo add an update. following GWR response I contacted customer service who kindly confirmed that on their screen they could see my refund had now been authorised following my appeal for the original amount and that I would receive an email confirming this within 2 days. I've now recieved said email telling me the appeal was unsuccessful. For some reason they continue to claim I travelled on an earlier train which is completely untrue. am happy to provide receipts of food I bought whilst waiting for the later train seriously need to sort out their customer service.",

How do they get away with it? \n\nThe trains are almost always delayed or cancelled. \n\nA few weeks ago, I had accidentally bought a ticket for the wrong time - my fault completely, however was totally an innocent mistake.  As I said, I attend university, hence not being famous for having extra cash to spare. The man told me I can either pay \u00a380 for an \u2018any time single day ticket\u2019 or get prosecuted. I continued to pay which left me pocketless, I planned to spend the \u00a380 on food and travel for the week. I had already paid \u00a322 for the single ticket so that single, 50 minute journey cost me \u00a3102. I later did some research, a single any time day ticket is \u00a355. Bloody scammers. GWR only get customers because it\u2019s literally the only option we have. \n\nNeeds to be changed, why am I paying so much money? What does the customers money go towards? It\u2019s certainly not improving train quality, train punctuality or efficiency.\n\nI would rather die than travel with GWR. They\u2019re lucky most of us have no choice. I despise these trains and get angry sat on them. F\u2019ing scammers. ",

        "review_text": "Gwr gets worse year by year. Or at least its management and train controllers do. I appreciate some things are outside their control but when delays are encountered now they seem to take planned  stations stops off at a whim and then they change it again and then today a third time in one journey . For the customers who don\u2019t really know where they are and have to re arrange transport and lifts a numbers of times in a row it\u2019s a nightmare . I have travelled up to london from Cornwall a few times recently and every single time they have been delayed significantly.  Today I\u2019m on a train that has been delayed and stops taken off and people told to get off at Exeter. So we stayed on and then they decided to take even more stops off. Upon the second round of planned station stop removals we were advised to get off at Plymouth and catch the 18.21 instead, with no concern  shown it isn\u2019t really the 18.21 because that in turn is delayed but they don\u2019t mention that. Then something that is 100% in GWR\u2019s control . The unreliable catering. It is so hit and miss and on last three legs the trolley wasn\u2019t there or \u2018they couldn\u2019t get to all the coaches\u2019. To travel four to five hours with no catering is abysmal and this happens to me on at least half my journeys all the time.  I feel for the poor staff who have to deal with grumpy customers , it can\u2019t be easy for them and probably accounts for many shift absences. It was so easy when they had buffet cars. Other companies have new trains and manage it. Anglia have buffet cards AND trollies. I love travelling by train and have lived in many areas of the country but Gwr seem to have a knack of making travel miserable and frustrating.  They need to take a hard look at themselves and start putting their customers first and provide a better service than they seem able to. It\u2019s getting worse every year. However as always the train staff are fabulous , the catering staff, ticket inspectors , train managers , they are all just brilliant but I feel for them where management, bean counters and train controllers, all of whom,  don\u2019t have to face customers make all these decisions from behind the safety of a desk . Thank you to all the train staff doing such a fabulous job but as for Gwr train designers and buyers , senior managers and the train controllers it so often feels like a complete shambles . ",

My thanks to GWR and all the staff involved. I would give them 10 out of 5 stars if I could",

I also have problems with balance so getting off the train is even worse and very painful for my knees. As I don't drive I used the train a lot. Short and long journeys. (Including First Class).  I am no longer able to use GWR trains. If I have to (to visit my daughter in London) I absolutely dread it. I am glad my children are grown up because getting a child, pushchair and suitcase on board and off again would be a nightmare! I imagine GWR have lost many passenger's fares due to this! GWR ought to build a hump like the station in Wales (Ibelieve it's called the Harrington Hump) in every station affected. They make enough money in expensive train fares!",

My son stayed very calm and didn\u2019t come across violent or aggressive to this lady, however she then decided to call the police. Minutes later my son was banned from the great western train line. The police escorted him to a different train line which would take him nearly triple the time to get home (2 hours) when his original train would have only been 20 minutes. I am furious of the way the manager has treated my son and if i could give the railway zero stars i would. No minor should have to be waiting this long and be told to take a different train at his age and so late at night over a situation provoked by another person. Furious.",

However with the right approach from staff the a difficult situation can be mitigated. Again read the reviews. Today my wife with disability and I had a terrible return journey. Some staff contact upon review was terrible, whatever the process helping the customer should be a great priority. We do recall in all of this great service on the Bristol to Penzance 2.55 from Bristol today. That service came from the guard/ticket inspector. He made a point of returning to us when train arrived in Weston super mare to see if he could assist my wife having noted her disability earlier. With more actions like this GWR could improve overnight. Sadly I can only conclude that management are to weak to travel on the service themselves and take up issues when they come across them. Asking passengers to fill in a complaint form is really quite poor. My experience today was not good. We have been using the trains more frequently of late & I can understand why customer satisfaction is at a low level. I have been responsible for customer service of millions of customers and if the culture is not right poor outcomes are unavoidable. There is confusion in GWR as to who is the customer. The customer is the passenger and not the regulator looking at targets. ",

I challenged a guard who let this happen and he was so rude and had a disgusting attitude you can't treat people like this. Its their job to move them or make them upgrade. Passenger assistance booked well in advance often doesn't turn up. When trains are cancelled they give no alternative way of getting there. Staff at ticket office run by them give no help either. In first class they don't offer free meals or alcohol like on avanti or lber you have to pay for it an utter con. Staff at Paddington first class lounge have a go at you for eating the fruits thsts on offer that's the whole point. There's nothing first class about their services.

They frequently pull one of them) leaving a half-sized, overcrowded train where uour seat bookings are for a non-existent carriage.\n\nAnd the strike service is woeful. I've had a 1.46 (normally) service (for which they happily sold me a ticket) take well over 3 hours/3 different trains (one of them dangerously overcrowded). Their answer-delay your journey or accept the service (with no delay repay-apparently I wasn't delayed because they chose to double the duration of the journey).\n\nA great service, once, which has been consistently run down.",

There are different types of ticket - an off peak ticket purchased in advance does not equal an advance ticket, and unless you're a born bureaucrat you don't check when you book.  For an adance ticket you can only claim a refund for unused tickets if you buy a new ticket before the original travel date.  GWR refused to accept a covid test, and not collecting the ticket as evidence for a refund.\n\ni think the moral of the story is a) book as late as possible, b) never expect them to refund anything if they can possibly find small print to avoid it and c) personally i will try and avoid gwr altogether where possible",

For the past two years, I never made it to my change station on time, and the train was departing without me. Every single time I have to wait until midnight to get the closest next train, with the wait another 30-40 minutes in dark and cold station simply because swr train didn\u2019t make it on time, again. Recently a delay was TWENTY minutes, bear in mind I\u2019m only given 8 minutes to change in between the trains. Right now I\u2019m once again taking the train which arrived to me on time, there were no strikes or warnings that it could be late - however somehow I\u2019m once again 8 minutes behind, leaving me with no time to change for my next train. I only ask to be humane and understand that people can have multiple changes and delays in 5-10 minutes will result in the failure of the whole journey. I was meant to meet up with my friend this evening for the cinema but now it\u2019s cancelled because they won\u2019t wait extra 40 minutes. No one will. However I\u2019m forced to do it when it\u2019s cold and raining, at the time when my journey was planned.",

As for striking for more pay, they don't deserve it, can't keep trains on time, trains are always being cancelled, no care towards their customers and over inflated prices. Supposed to be travelling by train on Thursday again, but that certainly will not be happening, I would rather not travel then have to travel on a train again.

Then: 'The next train to arrive is the 11.10 to cardiff Central ........consists of THREE carriages!' People were packed like sardines into these 3 carriages.

I looked on the GWR app again and it said the train had stopped at the platform I was on, which it obviously hadn\u2019t because I was standing waiting for it. I could\u2019ve been on the bus home if GWR hadn\u2019t updated the app stating there would be a train at 19:43. I then had to wait in the cold until 20:40 when the train finally showed up. By the time I have got home, I am too tired to cook myself dinner. The rail line has been shut for the past three weeks because they\u2019ve been \u201cupgrading it\u201d. Where is the upgrade GWR? I am fed up of waiting for hours on end for trains. When is this issue going to be resolved? I spend \u00a350 on trains every week, though for the past month, every train I have caught has been delayed. I have missed hours of college and hours of work due to GWR. Also, \u00a36.40 for a 15 minute train journey is absolutely appalling. I can not wait to drive so I will NEVER have to rely on GWR AGAIN. What a waste of my night.",

        "title": " Unacceptable Service at a Premium Price: The Great Western Rail Maidenhead-Paddington Debacle",
        "review_text": "Paying over \u00a34500 a year for the Great Western Rail (GWR) service between Maidenhead and Paddington should guarantee a seamless commute. Instead, GWR offers an experience that borders on the intolerable, blatantly disrespecting both the time and finances of its passengers.\n\nPunctuality is Nonexistent: GWR\u2019s concept of timekeeping is abysmal. The routine delays and cancellations are a direct insult to any notion of professional commitment or personal time. The lack of communication during these delays only compounds the frustration, showing a blatant disregard for passenger convenience.\n\nSardine Can Conditions: The overcrowded trains during peak hours are a clear sign of GWR\u2019s failure to accommodate its passengers comfortably or even safely. Charging a premium for what amounts to a daily ordeal in cramped conditions is outrageous. The deteriorating state of the train interiors further demonstrates GWR\u2019s neglect towards maintaining a standard of service.\n\nCustomer Service is a Myth: Encounters with GWR staff, on the rare occasion they occur, have been utterly disappointing. Their indifference towards passenger grievances shows a systemic failure in training and customer service ethos. The robotic and impersonal responses to complaints are a testament to GWR\u2019s disregard for its customers.\n\nA Gross Mismatch of Value for Money: The audacity to charge exorbitant fees for this level of service is astonishing. GWR appears to operate in a bubble, oblivious to the standards of value and service that customers rightly expect. This isn\u2019t just poor service; it\u2019s a comprehensive failure to deliver on basic promises.\n\nGWR\u2019s Maidenhead-Paddington service is a textbook example of how not to operate a train service. We, the passengers, are not mere revenue streams but the lifeline of your operation. Our patience has its limits, and they have been thoroughly tested.\n\nImmediate and significant improvements are non-negotiable. GWR must take drastic actions to overhaul its service, focusing genuinely on enhancing the passenger experience. Until then, passengers have every right to question the utility of their investment and explore alternatives that respect their needs and contributions.\n\nTo GWR: It\u2019s high time to recommit to your passengers or step aside for a service that will.\n\nThis version intensifies the critique, emphasizing the need for urgent action by Great Western Rail.",

After every single south western rail train cancelled for the last two days, stuck in Somerset, we decide to head to Yeovil Penn Mill for the great western experience.

We spend \u00a345 on a taxi to get out here, hopeful to return us to London and not be fired from our jobs and lo and behold the West country druids have decided that this is where we must remain until death. \u00a3100 of GWR train tickets, \u00a3100 of South west rail tickets, a \u00a345 taxi, lunch and my cat traumatized beyond belief. All we want to do is leave this God awful county and it's rubbish transport system behind. Big up Dracula cabs though for getting us through the floods. Because excellent driving and he knows our address. \n\nUpdated as per below reply - we used the WhatsApp service throughout the whole time and unfortunately received no response. What we would like is compensation - we arrived for one train, was told it was cancelled went to a pub to wait for the next, return to discover it did in fact run and the later one we were told to wait for was then cancelled. We were then advised to taxi to castle Cary - despite the road being blocked so wasn't an option and eventually we're re route to WEYMOUTH to get back to London. 10+ hours of travel, exhausted and contracted flu. But thanks for the reply GWR - but no you don't answer your WhatsApp so best not recommend it...",

Finally after pushing into a seat occupied by a bag of a std class passenger and heated argument from three std class passengers who told me first class was declassified which was ridiculous the train departed. It was very distressing as a lone traveler to be berated for trying to find a seat, the stewards stayed out of the carriages until the train set off instead of helping, why do GWR not seat passengers with first class tickets before allowing std class passengers to take seats?

Cancellations appear to have become endemic, are unexplained, and invariably without passengers being offered an alternative such as bus replacement.

One suspects this is to ensure that as many persons as possible purchase tickets for a service that is not available to them. Station staff seem unable to offer apologies or empathise with what is often substantial inconvenience. It is as if the travelling public are an inconvenience. Why is it seemingly so impossible to run timely, clean, state of the art trains such as are enjoyed by the Spanish?   The problem is the travelling public soak up this dire service whilst there is little means to hold top management to account. I suspect that taking the Trans Siberian Express from Moscow to Vladivostok would be less of a challenge for the traveller than attempting a timely, uninterrupted journey from, say Newbury to London Paddington. However we will all continue to shuffle like so many lemmings onto these dire services when the inevitable price hike hits.  I suppose we just have to be grateful that any train is running. One of a number of reasons to emigrate.",

        "review_text": "GWR\u2019s Hitachi trains give a ghastly rail-travel experience. 1) The terrible seats are surely the most uncomfortable seat on any train that\u2019s ever existed.  Your posterior will be sat on a metal bar - that\u2019s thinly covered with a layer of fabric; it\u2019s like sitting on a rock.  The thin and far too upright back-rest is no better (seats in First Class are barely better; an utter waste of the extra cost).  You\u2019ll be squirming and aching within 20 minutes. Evidently every expense and consideration for physical comfort has been spared by GWR. This is not my opinion; every fellow-passenger and GWR worker that I\u2019ve ever spoken to agrees that the seating is horrendous. 2) The loud and CONSTANT tannoy announcements will frazzle your brain.  You can\u2019t think without interruption (aside from the ongoing agony of your posterior and back) for more than a few minutes at a time, before you\u2019ll again hear a set of inane, unnecessary, repetitious-to-insanity-producing announcements. 3) All year round the carriages\u2019 temperature will almost invariably be too cold.  For whatever unfathomable reason, there\u2019s seemingly a policy of \u2018we\u2019ve got air-conditioning in trains now, so let\u2019s use it maximally\u2019. 4) The harsh, blinding \u2013 interrogation luminosity \u2013 lights of the carriages at night will ensure you cannot relax, doze or sleep (even if you could do so miraculously through your bottom\u2019s pain and ignore the tannoy).  5) The demise of the buffet car, and its replacement with the trolley service, is a sad, sad thing.  In addition to a notional buffet car motivating you from your stupor of discomfort to stand up and walk somewhere to try to ease your seat-induced aches, and warm up, the buffet car was an institution \u2013 for the opportunity it gave to chat to fellow passengers. 6) The water dispenser for washing your hands in the WC cubicles almost never works well or at all.  Thus back to your torture-seat you\u2019ll stiffly hobble, with liquid soap all over your hands (until you learn to never pump soap until you\u2019ve experimented firstly to see how bad, if at all, the water is dispensing).  You arrive at your destination, even after (hopefully) a short trip, aching from the awful seats, freezing from the temperature, brain dead from the tannoy, squinting with tiredness/eye-strain from the glaring lights, and with sticky hands.  GWR clearly holds its heritage and its customers with utter indifference...or even contempt.  For with these trains GWR could hardly have engineered a more unpleasant train-travel experience if they tried.  And GWR merely reply with words that would deny us - thousands of us - of our (very) painfully real experience; they\u2019ll write such as \u201cour trains\u2019 seats are ergonomically designed and are supportive on long trips\u201d; as if their hollow words magic-away the incontrovertible GWR-shaming facts, such as that of their seats being horrendously uncomfortable (for all trips) and so that of our bodies seriously aching from sitting on the back-breaking, bottom-agonising, presumably cheapest seats GWR could buy for their Hitachi trains.  This is the age of the pain.",

Both ways the train was so overcrowded that i ended up sitting uncomfortably in the aisles. No major events in London, so i can only assume that this is a regular occurence. No food service at all, not that a trolley could navigate through the aisle, couldn't use the loo because the train was packed, corridors are narrow and difficult to navigate (bruised hips abound), doors also very narrow, suitcases spilling out into the aisle because they have space for about 5 cases in a 60+ seat carriage. For \u00a370 i would expect more than a small square of dirty carpet and severe leg cramp. \nStill not my worst experience with the new trains...took the train to Reading a couple of months ago to go on a bike ride...LOL! The tiny broom closet bike storage was already filled with 2 bikes, which apparently is the TOTAL storage for bikes on the train. Kinda glad, watched someone struggle to get their bike out, which involves climbing practically into the cupboard to lift your bike up above your shoulders to hook it onto a tiny hook...no chance i would do that. I just stood in the aisle with my bike, fortunately train was again so busy people were standing as insufficient carriages were provided, so no-one could move even if they wanted to. \nNever getting GWR again, such as shame as the service was prompt and fast but a company run this incompetently, it's clearly easier to drive to a town on the outskirts of London, park and get the tube in. So much for 'let the train take the strain', more like 'let the train give you pain'. What idiot bought these new trains?",

The staff themselves I find are unpleasant, it's like they're ready to scald you if you've made a mistake but yet you still brought a ticket end of the day. Generally their tickets are just so overpriced, I've stopped traveling with them unless I have to, because of this people look for ways to get cheaper tickets like the split ticket method, but then I find myself in predicaments where the train I arrived on (1 stop train) is then all cancelled when I'm trying to return home after a day at work so I have no choice but to jump on a direct train to just get home at all, to then hope I don't get checked otherwise I have to pay for a whole new ticket.",

I ordered return tickets online for a trip with my mother, i recieved an email a few days before our trip to make me aware the train was cancelled and if i wish to claim a refund - do so online. The refund system is not the best , you need to make a different account in order to make a claim for this and your made aware that there will be a \u00a310 'admin fee' on your refunded tickets which for me means i will only recieve one full ticket price back and Gwr keep the second ticket purchased for 'admin fees' although i filled out all forms online , provided evidence myself & correct bank details for a refund , wheres the admin in that process other than making it difficult and tiresome for people to request refunds. The journey was cancelled by absolutely no fault of my own but i loose one full price ticket because of Gwr cancelling the train , this to me seems very unfair. I could almost grin and bare a \u00a310 admin fee on one ticket but they have taken \u00a310 off BOTH tickets. Even the wait time on confirmation of refund is severly slow, i do appreciate the level of upset customers probably waiting for responses as well leaving the company a little snowed under. Can i also add that i purchased both tickets under the same order and they both have the same reference number on them - under one single order for two guests travel BUT im still being charged for two seperate ticket ' admin fees'. Its no wonder the trains are always cancelled as you must make enough money off the admin fees. \n\n Times are hard , people are struggling and that is food taken off my familys table so close to christmas. I had to front more money on the day of the event for alternative transport which i did not account for and i am still waiting to recieve half of that price back . I spent months saving for the trip at a stressful and financially pressuring time christmas can bring. \n\n'Great western railway' certainly not the name this company deserves , its by no means great & gives little emphaphy for its customers.\n\n In response to GWR\u2019s response below this is incorrect , i Whatsapped , rang & emailed and still received the same outcome . NOT a full refund issued nor any help .",

        "title": "GWR: Dreadful Service Gets Worse",
        "review_text": "I am shocked and appalled by the dreadful nature of GWR. They clearly believe they are a cut above the rest of us and have NO perception of what customer service looks like. \n\nBelow is my copy of the appeal to the ridiculous penalty fare I was given. \n\nToday I received notification that the Appeal service have decided that I have missed the deadline to appeal and therefore they will increase the fine. \n\nUNBELIEVABLE. I could not Appeal as their system blocked me out as GWR Person had filled in their form incorrectly. \n\nSmacks of a money making scam from GWR. Who's service is appalling - making people late or not able to get places due to strike action. \n\nIn my work commute I travel from Hungerford to Liverpool Street via train and tube.  As I travel on demand I buy tickets as required. There is no way to purchase the travelcard required for my commute from the machine on the station only a Anytime Day Return travel card which is more expensive.\nIf time and queue allows it (there is only one ticket machine) I will purchase the more expensive option, otherwise I purchase it from the conductor on the train.  On this particular morning when attempting to purchase my ticket on the train from the conductor, I was told that he did not have a printer that printed the correct ticket.  Due to this the conductor suggested I could purchase the ticket at the ticket office at the barriers coming off the trains.  I'd note I've always purchased my tickets and never ride a train without paying.  \nI went to the ticket booth and got in line roughly 10th in the queue.  I was talking my 7 year old daughter on the phone whilst waiting when a revenue office pulled me from the queue when I was next up to purchase my ticket.  I assumed he had the mobile ticket machine like the conductors and was going to sell me my ticket as this does happen sometimes.  Instead the officer asked what I was doing, where had I travelled from and he then rudely informed me that I he was going to issue a penalty notice for not paying for my ticket.  \nI explained to him what had happened but he kept insisting that I was trying to cheat the system, which is categorically untrue.  At this point I told my daughter I had to hang-up as this rude officer was harassing me.  He accused me of abusing him, again untrue, (I had only called him rude for interrupting me on a call without even an apology), and threatened to call over the police.  I requested he did as it would be helpful to get someone capable of rational thought to explain this situation to.  But it was an empty threat and he continued to tell me he would write the penalty notice.  I tried to get one of the ticket officers to intervene as they see thousands of customers using this same approach to pay for their tickets when unable to purchase on the train.  Whist he agreed with me he could not intervene due to the fact the officer had already started to write the ticket (he did not have my details in which to do so, so he can\u2019t have really got far).  After getting the notice I still waited in line and bought my ticket as I had originally set out to do. \nYou can check the CCTV in the station as I'd assume we were in a place that would be recorded.  In fact I encourage you to review it, talk to the ticket office, and even the rude revenue office.  The story won't change, I was waiting to purchase a ticket at Paddington Station, as agreed by the conductor.  The officer was totally out of line and represents the type of bullying we frankly do not need.  I'd expect that the footage is reviewed and appropriate disciplinary actions are taken against him.\nPlease note the time of this harassment was approximately 9 AM not noon as stated on the notice.\nI would appreciate your prompt review and expect the evidence of my statement, interviews of the ticket office, revenue office and of course the camera is surely enough to overturn this penalty.",

Started well with the 1103 Paddington to Bodmin Parkway via Plymouth departing on time with an allowed 5 minute changeover at Plymouth. Then apparently \"congestion\" near Exeter St Davids made us around 5 minutes late. This then became 8 minutes and by the time we had gone far beyond Exeter to arrive at Plymouth it was 15 minutes.\n\nIf you allow just a 5 minute change at Plymouth then you really need to be able to run the incoming service on time! The Paddington train was so late arriving at Plymouth that we missed the connection, with the result we then missed onward bus connections to North Cornwall and had to get a taxi at our expense. \n\nTrain \"captain\" had already radioed ahead to hold a branch line service somewhere, but apparently the service from Plymouth on to Bodmin could not be held despite it being obvious the connection would be missed. Not impressed. Later 1446 Plymouth to Bodmin was also only 5 coaches so was rammed due to passengers like us who missed the 1418.\n\nSpoilt what should have been the start to a very special weekend. Our first journey on GWR for around 20 years and we were both really looking forward to it. Never again - we'll drive next time. My wife doesn't like watching me go purple.",

        "title": "WARNING - GWR ARE FRAUDSTERS!!",
        "review_text": "I am writing this review so to warn other passengers of the abysmal customer service the Great Western Railway.\n\nOn the 31/07/23 I went onto GWR website to book a ticket for 02/08/23 from Redhill to Swansea, I proceeded to the card payment section and entered all the details. However, after waiting a few minutes the GWR website advised me they were having problems with their site and I should try again later, I therefore cancelled and logged out understanding my payment had not gone through! Later in the evening I went back onto GWR website and this time was successful with payment being accepted and my booking made to travel on 02/08/23, I had an e-ticket which I travelled with on the booking date and as far as I was aware everything was fine.\n\nHowever, on 18 August I logged onto my bank account where I could see that 2 payments for the same amount had been taken from my account for the same journey!!  I immediately contacted GWR customer service, waiting 40mins to get through, to explain the situation and was informed by an unpleasant and indeed unhelpful customer service member that I had to wait 28 days or at least until the 28th of August to receive an automatic refund which she informed me was called a \"ringfence payment\" I was very sceptical that this would the happen but gave them the benefit of doubt  and waited until the 28th of August but to no surprise I did NOT receive my refund! I had no option but to waste another half a day trying to contact them to find out why I had not received the refund as previously informed!  \n\nAfter waiting another 55 mins to get through I did eventually speak to another advisor who was far more helpful and explained that the \"ringfence refund\" was not for my situation and she was going to log a complaint and request my refund for double payment for the same journey be refunded asap. I waited 10 days as I was advised it could take 7-10 working days for the refund dept to sort the refund  but I would definitely get a refund this time!! \n\nHowever, you can guess, no refund was ever received!! \n\nTo my astonishment however, what I did receive was an email from a customer Support Advisor informing me that they only offer refunds on claims made within 28 days of the tickets expiry date and as it was now 11th Sept they would NOT be refunding me as it was over the 28 days!\n\nDouble payment had been taken erroneously by GWR, they had given me incorrect information by way of the \"ringfence payment refund\" they had advised my to wait 28 days and again to wait another 7-10 days to receive my refund and YET they have the audacity to inform me they are not returning my money because I am out of time, not only is this unbelievable it is FRAUDULANT and I following trading standards advise I will be logging a formal complaint as advised, however, this does not deal with the distress and time wasted spent trying to get my money back which GWR should never have taken in the first place!!  BEWARE, if you pay by card be careful they do NOT do this to you!!\n\nIf I could have given a zero score I would have but as 1* does not reflect their total incompetence!!",

So on holiday without return rail tickets . Contacted GWR apparently it was my fault as I should not have used the post. Buy new tickets GWR said.  I did without choice, not from GWR . I have since tried to obtain refund for my tickets which did not arrive in time . This has been weeks of excuses from GWR and repeatedly asking for proof of tickets which I submitted 3 times. Today they have said refund unsuccessful as they do not have any evidence of tickets..... Blatantly factually incorrect.  Avoid GWR tickets as customer service does not exist.",

No common sense. Please reprimand Anisha as this is little Hitler syndrome and not what you want from your staff. The earlier train was empty and  later train is full. Also 10:03 is cancelled. \nThe trip is also a bus replacement from Plymouth to St Erth.\nNeed I say more - If you can avoid using this service i would.",

The host Arianna was exceptionally attentive and rearranged our travel assist and waited with us until my mother was collected directly from our coach.  Omar the driver was a little more maverick and persuaded a couple of the ladies to squeeze up to allow my mother a precarious place on the back for which he decided no seatbelt was necessary.  He gave me instructions about how to get to the taxi rank to meet them and to be fair delivered her safely but I wouldn\u2019t say he had the clearest idea about managing disabled passengers.  However, I do think Arianna should receive credit for her customer focus.  Despite being in first class, I am still not impressed with the new stock of trains - they are definitely not as comfortable as the pre-electrification stock.",

The ticket prices are outrageous for the service we get.  Today for example going out there was a five instead of nine carriage train and coming home was nearly an hour delay due to a signalling problem between Didcot and Reading and the driver getting off at Reading so a new driver being needed.  After a year of travelling weekly, I have now lost patience as there is at least one problem nearly every time.  From now will be requesting refunds so the delays have to be logged by GWR.

However, the earlier 18.50 train was reduced to 5 carriages instead of 9, there was no seat reservation system on the train, and because it was so overcrowded the trolley service was suspended. If this was a one off, it would be OK, but almost every train out of Paddington I have been on for the last 6 months - 12 in total - has had an issue. I have complained 3-4 times and you get the same patronising rubbish about how much extra capacity they have put in. Funny that, because I am on an overcrowded train every journey back from Paddington to Bristol Parkway.",

My partner and I travelled from Worcester to Bristol return with our bikes, on both train journeys we were treated awfully, train conductors were almost offended because we had bikes and it was like they found us to be a problem even though we had done NOTHING wrong. On the return train the doors were open for what felt like 30 seconds not giving my partner enough time to get off with his bike after me. I shouted to the train conductor to please wait and all she did was blow her whistle and say it was \u2018too late\u2019???? This caused my partner to have to get off at the NEXT station almost 20 minute drive away and all we got was a TOO LATE? If you are taking your bikes on the train then it\u2019s not worth train conductors being so rude to you for no reason. I won\u2019t be getting on any trains for a very long time - disgusting.",

Didn't think much about it. I got to Paddington in the late evening GWR offices were closed. I took the 11.45 pm train to Cornwall. I only then noticed there seemed to be a technical glitch as I couldn't find the ticket. The onboard inspector was understanding (he could see the proof of purchase etc). However, when I got to Truro, the ticket revenue employee demanded I pay for a second ticket despite me showing I had already paid for a valid ticket for that particular train. I wrote to GWR customer services 100% certain I would get a refund.  But, no refund, just went on that I didn't travel with a valid ticket... TLDR this company has gone downhill so badly, from being a trusted company, to being a technically incompetent bully.  Dreadful attitude. The fish rots from the head I suppose. They should be happy when passengers pay for journeys and be reasonable when something goes wrong ( with their systems).  ps. After looking at GWR response below, didn't I make myself clear? Did they actually read my 'review'? I only got angry AFTER the response from the Customer Services Complaint team. Bad service and lacking common sense is one thing, doubling down on it, is completely unacceptable (and shooting yourself in the foot as a company)",

I\u2019ve lost complete faith in the service and it\u2019s not cheap and when you try to get compensation you get \u00a34! Refund. Never mind that I\u2019ve missed my key business meeting and spent far too long on a platform waiting for my train. It\u2019s so poor that I\u2019m going to consider driving into London again.

I asked if he worked for GWR he said yes but who why on earth would I think I could get a QR code at the station. He took enjoyment from the fact that I'd only been sent the ticket part and said it wasn't his problem. I asked if there was a manager I could speak to he said no. I was told by the website team to just buy a new ticket. I said I can't afford to. They said they would write it all down and make sure it's recorded so I get refunded but I wouldn't be allowed on the train. I was never refunded. They said they will not refund me because I didn't purchase another ticket. I said that would have put me \u00a3220 in debt. I never made it to Plymouth.",

I got onto the Train and the first thing that I noticed it was packed. I walked down 2 Carriages and there were even People sitting on the floor despite having paid for a Ticket. Admitted that it was a Sunday the 6th instant and I guess People were heading home despite the fact it was just after 5pm. After having gone through 2 Carriages I noted the First Class being virtually empty. Rather than having People sit on the Floor all the way to Paddington,bearing in mind they have paid probably an extortionate price, why not downgrade one of the First Class Carriages and let People sit in comfort? \nI saw an empty Carriage and said to Robert who was on Duty that I had a bad cold so he said nothing and I remained seated and he even offered me some water.\nBlow me down 5 minutes later Mr Ticket Inspector comes along and rudely demands \u00a310 extra. I told him that Robert never told me to move whereupon Mr Ticket Inspector was virtually shoving the Machine under my Face and demanding extra money.\nI left in disgust.\nLesson to be learned\nManners Maketh Man as my Dad used to say to me.\nGo back to School Mr Ticket Inspector and learn something called manners\nI shall be bringing The Health and Safety Executive into this and a Screenshot of this message will be sent.\nGWR you are putting your Passengers at risk by allowing them to sit on the Floor. \nWhat if the Emergency Brake were to be pulled. There were People sitting by the Doors that would have been at risk plus anyone sitting anywhere on the Floor could have been thrown by the impact of the sudden stop\nAs for me, I got a seat eventually as a previously gready person taking up 2 seats ( one with Luggage) lifted said item onto his Lap when I flashed my over 60 Senior Rail Card\nDisgusting performance GWR leaving 2 Carriages virtually empty and have everyone else being treated like Cattle in a Cattle Truck",

I said she was with me and was quite shocked she did that\u2026..she then scanned my codes and it seems they were the ones for the cancelled train I had purchased. I had tickets for this new train at extra cost to me , and we were sat in the reserved seats . I showed the jnfo for this booking, however I was struggling to access the wifi to show the email with the new tickets. ( I thought they were the ones I had given her) I had to make several changes due to the strikes and didnt delete original cancelled codes as was worried about deleting the wrong ones)\nShe was rude, instantly said I had to pay for new tickets and I refused as I had tickets. Then the penalty was brought out. When i eventually managed to locate the correct codes she just scanned them and said nothing. I felt like a criminal and told her so. Poor carriage full of people who had to endure this\u2026.. sorry \u2026\u2026 but I am not prepared to be bullied by people like her when I had done nothing wrong. She ruined my trip and caused great distress. Very very bad attitude towards law abiding people.",

At Taunton was asked to give up seats for an elderly couple, which we did and stood in the packed carriage. It was like a sardine can and could not even access the toilet. Staff said we would get refund if we wrote to GWR 1st class which I did; but nothing back. Only paid us back \u00a311.30 for two tickets due to delay. This was not the first class experience I paid for and will be intouch with my credit card company for \"goods as not described etc\" \nSnacks had to be passed around, as the train staff could not get through. \nIf I pay for first class, I expect first class and not having to stand in the middle of the carriage for nearly 2 hours.",

He wouldn't even listen(no human feeling at all). Just wanted to issue me a new ticket of \u00a360 when I already have a \u00a3123 ticket. \nI then told him to issue me a penalty(hoping to appeal and make the appeal team sea reason with me). This must have upset him. He just went funny on me. Smirking and giggling at anything I said after. Holding my ticket hostage(Apparently he wants to go get the people to issue me a ticket).\nIf you are not the one to issue me a ticket why not give me the ticket I paid for back and go get those people. \nNo he refuse, continue to make fun of me with his funny attitude. \nThis went on for like 10-15 minutes. Eventually the revenue team came through and took over the case. The 2 ladies were very nice. Issues me a ticket(fair, I hope to appeal it because I do have a ticket and the one I booked was more expensive than the other one there so I thought it was valid and never encountered an issue like this I didn't check it much)\nThrough out the time these ladies dealt with my case. They never held my ticket hostage. Gave it back when I asked. I even asked for some explanation why they gave me back my ticket when I asked and Vincet decided to find it hostage. No vivid explanation was offered except that it states on the ticket that this is a property of the train(even though it doesn't). You see lots of used tickets in the bin. That won't be the case if it's a property of the train.",

We paid just short of \u00a3100 for 2 1st class seats for comfort and refreshments but as they allowed standard class passengers to sit in the corridor they couldn't get through with the trolley. They said for safety they can't provide refreshments. They managed to walk through with water so I am at a loss why the crisps/biscuits/snack boxes could not be carried through with the reason given was for safety, hot drinks I agree there is a safety issue but the snacks could have been carried through. We contacted Customer Services to complain as the staff on the train told us to do that, but Customer Services couldn't care less. They requested copies of the train tickets which we provided and they basically said its better to run a train with less carriages than to have it cancelled and nothing about not having the refreshments we had paid for. Why ask for ticket proof if that was going to be the response. Had the train been cancelled at least we would have been given our money back on the delay repay and potentially had a better service on a later train. This train was packed so they made money on that and also saved money because they did not provide refreshments to all the first class passengers who had paid for them on that train. I will avoid this company in the future unless it goes back into public ownership.",

My disability is invisible but I am in constant pain and struggle to breath due to cancer. I made a complaint and was told there would be an investigation but I would hear no more. Unacceptable - surely a refund and apology would be appropriate and the opportunity for me to tell the man about the effect his behaviour had on me. This was an opportunity for conciliation and learning which was lost. It's awful travelling as a disabled person and has made the end of my life more challenging. I now stay at home....it's not worth the risk\n\nUPDATE: letter from GWR saying refunds not offered as people could make up incidents. What happened to me was witnessed by a train manager.

        "title": "Poor Treatment of Customers on GWR Falmouth to Truro Route",
        "review_text": "I strongly dislike the way this company treats its customers, particularly on the route between Falmouth and Truro. The entire experience is consistently unpleasant. Their approach to customer service leaves much to be desired, as they manage to make passengers feel unwelcome and tense. The staff treats everyone as potential criminals until they provide proof of their tickets and railcards. It's a given that they will check your tickets and railcards without fail. \n\nIf you attempt to purchase a ticket on board, you will promptly be scolded for not buying it at one of the smaller stations along the Falmouth to Truro route or online. If the company insists on policing everyone, it would make everyone's lives easier if they installed gates, clearly indicating that the only way to board is by purchasing a ticket in advance. Alternatively, they could at least put up some signs to inform passengers of the proper procedures.\n\nRecently, I witnessed an elderly lady, between 80 and 90 years old, attempting to buy a ticket on board. She was completely shocked to learn that she would be fined next time and that she must acquire a ticket prior to boarding. This is particularly concerning considering that some people only use their service once a year or may have difficulties with their memory. Additionally, the machine at the Penryn station is hidden from plain view, making it easy for passengers to forget to purchase their tickets. To make matters worse, there have been instances where the machine has food smeared on the screen, making it even more difficult to purchase tickets. These issues are clearly evident from the accounts of other unhappy customers. It's disheartening to see how the company makes its customers feel, especially considering that it has only been six months since they installed new machines and everyone is well aware of the strict ticket checks.\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you for taking the time to respond and provide the link GWR. I appreciate your confirmation of the policy. While I understand and respect the need for ticket checks, I would like to emphasise the importance of a customer-friendly approach. It can be discouraging and stressful when customers, who have valid tickets and railcards, feel intimidated and stressed during the process.\nI have noticed that some passengers still believe it is possible to purchase tickets onboard the small service between Falmouth and Truro, which suggests a gap in communication. Installing ticket gates and clear signage directing customers to the ticket machines or online options could be effective in ensuring everyone boards with appropriate tickets.\nContinuing to make honest and paying customers uncomfortable may discourage them from using the service and potentially lead to them seeking alternative means of transport. Additionally, it could create a sense of hostility within the community.\nI genuinely believe that by adopting a more customer-centric approach, the overall experience for both passengers and staff can be greatly improved. Thank you again for your attention to this matter.",

Nothing except biscuits or a mystery snack box (bread sticks, hummus, pretzels - all mini). Then we get to lunchtime and... No food on Sundays, just the choice of biscuits or a mini snack box (see breakfast). I can't eat 2 snack boxes - nutritionally terrible. So I'm bloody hangry instead. And furious that I've paid so much more money for nothing. Absolutely appalling and unacceptable. And this is after my outward journey was delayed 3 hours and GWR is trying to reject my refund request. To say I furious is an understatement. How is this a justifyable service?

The CHEAPEST ticket was \u00a399.80. I caught the 10:42 from Taunton (which was on time- miraculously) I had a seat booking which I was told by another passenger was void because the previous train had been cancelled. I would have liked to leave London about 5:30pm, but if I had done that my one day travel card would have gone up to over \u00a3125- which is just ridiculous for one day. The earliest cheapest train I could catch was 19:04, which was much later than I wanted to leave. I had a seat booking for this train too, and had requested a window so I could see where the train was. The train left approximately 20 minutes late, got slower and arrived just after 9:20pm, not 20:47 as it was timetabled to. My booked seat was not a window, it was a blank wall- why was I given seat 92 as a window when it's a blank wall? This is not the same. Expensive and unreliable- do better!",

        "review_text": "GWR's cancellation of the Night Riviera Sleeper this week has plunged me into a dystopian nightmare, trying to get a refund on fares and sleeper reservations, not to mention connecting services. GWR gave me three days notice of the cancellation, but are refusing to refund four sleeper berths because I needed to apply more than seven days prior to travelling. It has also charged a \u00a310 admin fee for refunding the fares, and a further \u00a310 for cancelling a GWR connecting service. The refund procedure is awful, and there is no telephone help line. I will never, ever risk using GWR, let alone the sleeper again. I will get my refund if it takes going to the ombudsman, but it will take hours of effort. My advice is, steer clear.",

Similar to the reviewer below (@Richard de Neufville), I got all the way to the end of the booking procedure, indicated my address, ticked all the boxes and pressed \"Buy now\". Nothing happened, the page just kept reloading, without giving me the possibility to enter my visa card details, and without any error message popping up either. I tried again multiple times, on two different browsers, unsuccessfully. \n\nI then decided to try to buy the tickets through the GWR app, downloaded the app, but as soon as I tried to enter London as my starting point I received the following error message: \"We're sorry but we can't complete your request at the moment due to a technical issue, please try again later\". \nI contacted Customer's service via the online chat, who was unable to explain what had gone wrong with the booking through the website. \nIn the end, they found the explanation: the system blocked because it turns out that when you book from abroad (France in my case), you cannot choose the electronic ticket option, you have to collect the paper tickets at the train station. Aside from the absurdity and environmental impact of such a policy, it is nowhere indicated on the website, which does allow you to tick the option \"electronic ticket\". \n\nCustomers' service was completely inadequate, and said the issue would be fixed very shortly. Three days later, nothing has changed on the website and the \"temporary\" glitch on the app has not been fixed, making it effectively impossible to book a GWR ticket.",

This was a demonstrable mistake that was clearly evidenced. The charge from GWR for the mistake amounted to being punitive. Particularly when there was no hot water, the train was running late (as usual) and multiple toilets were out of order. The trains are cheap and falling apart, the service is utterly unreliable.

        "title": "Inflexible luggage policy and a very unfriendly member of staff",
        "review_text": "I arrived to London Paddington to catch an 8am train on a bank holiday Monday to Bodmin (Cornwall) with a 6 foot surfboard in a board bag. When I arrived to the gates, I was informed that the GWR policy states they don't allow surf boards. Now, despite this being the case, I was able to do this coming from Bodmin to Paddington a week before without any issue.\n\nWhen I arrived to the gate, a man (kindly) notified me that I couldn't take my board on the train but perhaps because it was quiet I could ask at the information desk and they'd make an exception. So there I went, and I spoke to another polite man who said the same thing: that it's against policy but perhaps because it's quiet the train manager would allow it.\n\nI then attempted to get back through the gates so that I could speak to the train manager, one of the staff at the gates was immediately unfriendly to me and told me that I couldn't go through and that I will not be allowed to board the train. After trying several times to politely ask if I could just go through and have a conversation with the train manager (as I had been instructed to do) he started shouting at me. I ignored him due to the fact he was being totally unreasonable and then went to back to the gate where the first member of staff (who asked me to go to the information desk) allowed me through. The extremely impolite employee, then came round and proceeded to shout at both myself and his colleague who permitted me to go through so that I could talk to the train manager. He then threatened to call the police to remove me because I was not permitted to be there - to be threatened like that was, quite frankly, a disgusting level of customer service. I ignored his threat and proceeded to find the train manager.\n\nI spoke with the train manager who, respectfully, employed his common sense and saw that my 6ft surfboard would fit in the bike storage of this practically empty train. I was then allowed to board the train and put my surf board in the storage (of which I have a photo - it's an empty bike storage with a 6ft board bag upright in the side, perhaps taking up 10% of the storage space).\n\nAfter being on the train for a few minutes, just before departure and just after I'd eaten my breakfast, the train manager came and found me and asked me to leave the train. It wasn't worth the argument and it was clear that the shockingly impolite employee had escalated the issue and made a big deal out of nothing. I felt as though he was purposely going out of his way to ruin my day.\n\nI got off the train and then as I walked back to the gates the impolite employee proceeded to raise his voice at his colleague who let me through to which point they got a manager involved to speak to the polite member of staff. I was then asked to leave and not be involved but I can't help but think what a sad, pathetic situation this is that the manager is talking to/perhaps disciplining the member of staff who was kind to me and tried his best to help out a customer  despite a nonsensical arbitrary policy which says I can't bring a surf board on an empty 8am train. Instead of this incredibly rude man who repeatedly raised his voice at both me and his colleagues and was nothing but unhelpful, unfriendly and unreasonable.\n\nI then had to get the tube with my board to London Waterloo where I caught a train with SW trains to Exeter St. Davids and then ask my girlfriend to drive 1.5 hours to come and pick me up. A huge inconvenience to both of us.\n\nNot being able to take a 6ft surfboard in a bag on an empty train that would have made no difference to anyone's journey and only served to completely ruin my day - what a ridiculous policy. It should be at the train manager's discretion. I purposely got up early and caught a super off peak train because I wanted to ensure it wasn't any hassle.\n\nThe fact that every member of staff had to deflect the decision of permitting me onto the empty train with my surfboard to someone else makes me question how GWR treat their employees. I would perceive this as there existing a work culture where your staff members are discouraged to use their common sense and initiative in favour of upholding your inflexible, nonsensical policies to avoid being disciplined. I truly hope nothing has jeopardized the career of your polite employee and that you read this and consider changing your policy to something more flexible. Perhaps you could also consider identifying and educating the impolite employee on what is considered acceptable customer service.",

There's multiple issues with GWR. Where do I start. \n\nIt is quite clear that this company doesn't provide enough care for their staff. I heard this from the horses mouth only yesterday from someone within the organisation overhearing my partner's displeasure with the train service, and we were given all the real reasons why. Insufficient staffing, the closing of kiosks, track maintenance issues, several companies are involved in the participation to keep the railway track together rather than one consolidated rail service, no pay rises for the last 4 years etc (the list goes on). Morale is at an all time low. \n\nCustomers want to speak with real people; whether it's on the train, or at the train service. Stop closing the help desks and making staff cuts. \n\nAs a customer it is incredibly difficult to claim a refund. I use the trainline app in most cases and the app deletes my ticket. Most of the time I have to have a printed off ticket, and I provide this ticket for friends and family that I pay for to use the service. If that person doesn't keep the physical copy of the ticket, and a train is delayed or cancel, you cannot get a refund. Despite the organisation has full proof of the transaction and the code etc (which I can forward) Why is that? Surely that's proof enough?\n\nThe UK needs to nationalise the railway service in my opinion. It's evident that private companies don't have a handle on the situation.",

Other operators such as SWR and Cross Country are just not reliable, with bad timetable management (e.g. stopping every 5 minutes on a direct train). Overall, the trip was very nice and the train ride was comfortable with kind staff. I then got into Bristol Temple Meads and got on a train to London Paddington, the train was comfortable and is a chill ride overall. This is how train rides should be like in this country, GWR is a good example for other operators to follow, absolutely amazing experience.",

In any event, I do not use Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp... so your Customer Service continues to be useless.\n\nWhat Happened...\n\nOur train was an hour late leaving the station and then terminated altogether before our intended stop.  The train manager was most apologetic and advised we could get a full refund plus the cost of a taxi etc required to get us to our destination.  However, when we applied for the refund and costs it was a completely different story.\n\nOur first refund request was rejected with a short email that stated refund \u201cunsuccessful\u201d.  There was no reason provided.\n\nWhen I complained, an agent said they would look into it and asked for more evidence which I provided.\n\nA week passed and I heard nothing more\u2026 hence this bad review.\n\nTo date, GWR have simply washed their hands of the fact they failed to provide the service I paid for and have actually incurred me additional costs.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been robbed.\n\nGWR trains are, in my experience, frequently overcrowded.   Why is there no regulator to ensure safety on trains? \n\nIf you must travel via GWR, book with The Trainline who have an exceptionally good and easy refund policy.  GWR do not appear to want to refund their passengers at all.",

        "review_text": "App takes time to load digital tickets and there have been cases where the tickets haven\u2019t worked at barriers due a technical issue. Don\u2019t like the fact that if a train is cancelled, you can\u2019t get a refund on a ticket paid for through the app/online from the teller at the station. Need to have bought a paper ticket to get refund from teller. Don\u2019t like the fact that you have to set up separate login details for GWR ticket refunds. Why not integrate refunds into the single online GWR account already set up to buy tickets in the app? That way, if there are cancellations, already frustrated customers don\u2019t have to become more frustrated going through the long winded process of logging into the separate GWR Refunds website that also crashes on you whilst you\u2019re providing all the proof requested. Also, again on the GWR refunds website, if you already have a ticket reference that you can only obtain after purchase, why ask the customer to upload the actual ticket also? What\u2019s even more frustrating, after you\u2019ve finally managed to go through the long winded refund process, you get a message at the saying \u201cwe will typically respond to your claim within 28 days\u201d. Reduce this period to an acceptable 3-5 working days. The customer pays you there and then to buy the ticket but then due to an error in your train service, it takes nearly a month to refund the customer? Now the customer must bankroll GWR whist finding alternative transport. It\u2019s not often that train services are cancelled but when they are, an already frustrating situation is made even worse by how GWR deals with these situations. Why not provide a better experience as per feedback above and have returning customers that\u2019ll be happy to use your services again?",

        "review_text": "I use the train on a frequent basis from Cheltenham to London. It stops too frequently before Swindon with an idiotic reverse journey over to Gloucester. On many occasions, it saves me 45 minutes by driving to Swindon to get a train from Bristol to London. At least a few services should run direct to Swindon, maybe stopping once at Stroud. It is far too slow. On a positive, I always find the staff excellent. I have suffered cancellations, but usually for reasons beyond GWR control (incidents on track) and the refund process is swift and painless. Sadly you cannot say the same for the new Hitachi trains. They are awful. Could anyone design a more uncomfortable seat? You are sitting on a block of wood. I miss terrible the old HST trains. They might have been 40 years old but had more space and were far more comfortable. As a passenger, the new trains are a disaster.",

However, staff were pleasant and apologetic about this, and certainly not at fault: there is no promise of any catering delivery in the Ts & Cs anyway, where external factors are a cause; but they do their best. For some reason the staff were a lot chirpier on the return Penzance to Paddington journey, and very nice. Trolley service to seat was frequent, decent and friendly, with generous complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits, crisps, nuts, water etc. Good, comfortable solo window seat, affording nice views of the Cornish, Devonian and Somerset countryside. Both legs of the train journey ran like clockwork.\nI go 1st class if the ticket price is favourable, and to mitigate against the risk of a busy, noisy and cramped Standard class carriage. It depends on what you pay for a 1st Class seat, as to whether it's worth buying/upgrading to it. I'd use GWR 1st class again as it was sufficiently good for me.",

At one point in the journey (Cheltenham) we were all warned that the train was going to be packed with people leaving the racecourse - oh my god - if you know this already then you need to either limit the number of people getting on or lay on another service.  Gangways and exit routes completely blocked. \nFinal incident, just after Plymouth, involved a number of people in drink/drugs fighting. It was a very violent incident with one member of the warring group already prepared wearing a stab vest. \nI feel sorry and concerned that staff have to deal with such situations and it begs the question why allow people to travel if they are not fit to do so. No reassuring words from staff after the incident - I was completely traumatised. \nThe whole journey was a nightmare. \nNo decent refreshments either outward or on return - a technical issue meant there were no hot drinks - how about getting a new kettle??? Seats incredibly uncomfortable for one who is 6ft 2ins. with back and neck issues. Lavatories were unpleasant. Just the most expensive,  traumatising, unsafe experience. Arrived an hour late. \nThe suggestion that trains should be un-manned, from this experience, is putting innocent people at great risk of harm and vulnerability - you just simply can not heard a load of people into a tube that (when it\u2019s all working ok) is travelling at high speed and have no one overseeing the situation - this is a very dangerous move and one that must be resisted. \nIt\u2019s been a long time since I travelled by train - this whole experience was disgusting - MPs and the rail bosses should be made to travel standard class on a long journey on a full train to experience the progress achieved in the 21st century. You seriously need to learn from experiences like mine and do an awful lot better. \nFlying is safer, more comfortable and has better services for passengers but sadly not good for the environment.",

        "review_text": "On 8/11/22 I booked tickets for 12/03/23 whilst in Spain. After paying I found i purchased two tickets, in error. After dozens of emails, phone calls and three visits to Swindon Station I was getting nowhere with a refund. Then one of the trains (Elizabeth line) was cancelled, so I had to buy a third ticket. On 12/03/23, after Swindon Ticket office intervention, a fourth time, I received a refund on one of the tickets, thus one refund is still outstanding. I\u2019ve expended dozens of hours on this issue and can no longer tolerate any more, I give up. However, all praise to Swindon Ticket Office staff who have been bent over backwards to help. I\u2019ve been dining out on this story for months for it is as example of a dysfunctional organisation. Bring back BR.\nUpdate: message received to say the refund debt will be settled. 14 separate communications: including 2 x complaints 4 x visits to Swindon stations, hours on the phone, return call promises unfulfilled and web templates completed to no avail. There\u2019s got to be a better way GWR? After all if I get it wrong its \u00a3100 penalty fare plus full fare, or a summons to court (such as you did to my son). Thanks anyway, we got there in the end.\nUpdate: 5/4/23, all refunds complete, phew that was a struggle. Lesson learned: buy at the station not on-line.",

        "review_text": "I'm a frequent traveller who only source of transport is trains I was travelling from Redding to bath spa on the 9 March. In reading I was direct to a train after they check my ticket and told me to get on turns out they put me on the wrong train I quickly realised this and spoke to staff who completely ignored me and kicked me off. I got of in Swindon I saw 6 GWR staff talking I approached to ask for help the all ignored me completely. So went in side to ticket, information office no one there. I was able to find someone else I asked them they said platform 4 but you missed it there be another one at some point today. I went to ask when he shrugged walked off. I spoke to manager in bath spa about the situation and explained to me the mistake that happened in reading how too trains where beylayed so the train I got on was an earlier one that was beylayed and there staff member most likely didn't realise. Easy mistake it happens I have no issues there but with the staff who completely ignored me as the conversation were to important than there job. The managers I spoke to were very apologetic about it. However similar issues happen again on the way home from bath spa to reading on 11 march the train was delayed about 30 minutes.they also tried to get people to get on the next service as there was to many people trying to get on it was a struggle getting one lots of pushing and shoving shouting but I need to get on as at that point I could make my connection but through delays meant I missed it. I ask staff on the train if the now the next train I could take to make my connection. She said no I want to he\nDeal with something  else. Very pleasant encounter. Not. At this point I gave up trying to deal with any staff from GWR. So went to south western railway they were more than happy to help even though I wasn't travelling with them they went out of the way to help.",

She said she had to recharge me for the entire journey all over again as her colleague in the ticket office ignored the peak hour ticket on the smart card and gave me a off hour ticket, cost me an extra \u00a316.40. These people are a rip off so all in all, I payed for a journey there times over. If you should include return which was to zone 6 border. On the way back, missed my appointment by over and hour, every train to Paddington delay delay delay delay delay delay by 25 to 40 mins. I took the train because to cutbtime trave in car but it took me longer than the car. I know who won't be travelling on GWR no time soon.

        "review_text": "So I am traveling from Swansea to Bristol, booked via trainline. The app that basically everyone uses. Anyways they offer what's called a split save ticket where they manage to find a set of tickets that get you where you need to go. So I got a ticket that is from Swansea to bath spa to visit my mate the ticket inspector on the train from Swansea to Cardiff (destination London Paddington) insisted to scan both legs of the journey. I tried to explain that it's going to cause me problems down the line because it's scanned on the wrong train but he insisted and was horrendously rude about it (I suspect there is a racial factor in as I am an expat working in UK). On my leg from Cardiff to Bristol to change trains (I purposely wanted this itenery because Mark 3 coaches is comfortable and I am not sitting on ironing boards for the whole duration on their class 80x which causes me severe backpain) the train ticket inspector tried to scan my ticket and it got rejected stating it has already been scanned and it's not going through on him because it's been assumed I'm changing at some other station and I should not be there or something similar. Explained it to hrr what has happened and she was understanding to let me go my marry way, which redeemed them the 1 single star, or else the entire experience would be 0 stars. Not to mention their class 80x trains (IET I think they market it as)  is really uncomfortable and caused my already bad sciatica to be worse than it is. Made worse by their 'lumbar support' not doing anything other than pushing your spine in the wrong direction at the wrong ppacr (I work as a physio) anyways I'm writing this at bath where I have taken gabapentin to dull the pain when it's really bad",

The guard takes the trouble to walk the length of the platform and insist she get off as she is not in the bike carriage. She does so but is clearly in distress. Why didn't the guard instead take the trouble to help the customer reach the correct compartment? After the train pulls out, the guard makes an announcement blaming the customer for the train's late departure. 2) Reading, 30 minutes later. The same guard makes an announcement providing a physical description of a woman on the station platform.  She is, he says, responsible for a further delayed departure.  He asks any customers who know her to phone her and ask her not to do so again. Is this even legal?",

This ticket allows for 8 journeys in a 28 day period. Knowing there were some scheduled strike days falling on my usual commute days I asked if the ticket could be extend beyond 28 days to account for this. I was told no  but that I could claim back via the refund repay scheme for any days I would have been travelling in but couldn't due to strike activity. When it came to paying a claim it was rejected twice, saying I'd abandoned by journey. I'm in the process of escalating this as I feel I have been misled and lied to in the interests for gwr's profiteering. Don't use these tickets around strike periods or ever trust what gwr tells you. 8 in 28 days is also a breach of promise in legal terms too. I trust sense and fairness will prevail, but shouldn't have to go through so many hoops to get back my hard-earnt money!",

You simply can not rely on this as a service and its a roulette every time you want to get into work.\n\nTo add to this it is often exceptionally busy, with people having to stand in the aisles and doorways because of them using short trains with 5 carriages, and the back up caused by the delays. Its just an omnishambles.\n\n**UPDATE** \nTHE DAY AFTER I submitted this review I am now, yet again severely delayed on a GWR train.

        "review_text": "The customer service for our trip from London Paddington to Bristol and back was the most pleasant journey. Comfort, ease and we had an issue that the staff were exceptionally kind with. The trains, toilets, tables everything was cleaned, staff available and the best thing was that when our train from Bristol Parkway 1L36 was delayed due to a broken down freight train the train manager called through and saved about 30 passengers having to wait for about an hour for the next train. They held the train for 5 mis and told us exactly where to go but asked us to be careful due to cold weather and ice  . We were updates with the exact information all the way in. It was refreshing and a testament to great customer support.  Excellent , even the snacks staff and assistants were excellent.  We had been to a funeral so they gave us a chance to have a warm drink. I am astounded at the level of care I thought it dis not exist. Also as a woman of colour I sometimes get paranoid at bad  treatment but was so warmed today Thank you station managers Mathew in the morning, thank you Chris on the  21.52 1L36 service. \nThank you GWR for training your staff so well.",

Today (1 month after my claim) I received an email saying that's impossible for them to refund my first tickets because I don't have the pdf tickets for proof. Eeven if the purchase can be clearly seen in my GWR account! Unbelievable!\nAnd as you can see with the answer received below today, they propose to look at my claim but they didn't read my message because I already get through all the possible ways to make my claim (with at least 3h of time wasted on it): phone, staff at the station, refund service on line. And that's true, I forgot to tell that I tried also the WhatsApp channel who told me to call the customer service, who couldn't do anything. They just advise me to talk to the staff at the gates on the day of our departure to make us go through even with no pdf tickets! Which of course, was not possible on the day of the departure.\n.",

        "review_text": "Bad service and no compassion at all!\n\nWe went on holiday to Devonshire. I bought tickets in October for our holiday end of November. We were staying at the Traveloge in Barnstaple. At 25th November we went to the train station to inform about the train for 26th which we had booked.\nThere won't be trains on 26th because of the strike he said. We did not know this and had to take a train back on 25th. \nWe were able to use our original tickets on the way back but we lost a night of accommodation for 25th November at Traveloge. \nTraveloge said we don't refund because GWR had the strike and this is not our fault. GWR showed no compassion at all and just said they don't refund because they let the strikes no in advance.\n\nWhen I booked the tickets in October I did not know or I would have not booked for the night of 25th.\nSo we lost a night of accommodation because of this strike.\nEveryone had less money now and we are suffering the cost of living crisis but the trains keep striking when everyone has problems. Bad service from all staff Karen etc no we don't refund. Show some humanity and compassion because of the strike we lost a night of accommodation. Do at least a partial refund for the inconvenience but no. We don't do any refund!",

I boarded the train at Worcester Foregate Street and forgot to change trains at Worcester Shrub Hill and didn\u2019t realise this until the ticket man on the train said that I was heading towards Weymouth! So I had to change at Tewkesbury. When I boarded this train, the ticket man asked for my ticket and I explained the situation, he was very understanding and wavered my fee between Tewkesbury and Worcester. Despite the rail strikes and the disruptions, I was blown away by his compassion and professionalism. People are always so quick to read about the negative stories about our rail network but on this occasion I was really impressed with the service I received.",

        "title": "Compensation claim through Delay Repay - constant road blocks",
        "review_text": "When the GWR service I was on recently was delayed, the conductor announced that we were eligible for compensation and we should apply on GWR\u2019s Delay Repay. Grand announcements indeed, which don't match with the reality of the system, which seems set up to keep successful claims (even legitimate ones) to a minimum. \n\nMy return journey from Newton Abbot (NTA) to London Paddington (PAD) on 5 December was delayed by about 34 minutes on arrival. (scheduled departure: 12:55, actual departure: 13:14; scheduled arrival: 15:29; actual arrival: 16:04). So, I go to Delay Repay to make a claim but it was rejected because I submitted my booking summary (downloaded from my \"Past bookings\" in my GWR account, which had the booking ref but not the ticket - but that was the best I could do. GWR\u2019s \u201cAction Required\u201d rejection email said: \u201cPlease provide a photo or scan of your travel ticket(s).\u201d  The problem is: (a) the email confirmation from GWR did NOT attach a PDF of the ticket (like it was supposed to); (b) the QR codes with the ticket numbers on the booking have since been wiped from the app (apparently, the app erases them once the journey has taken place); and (c) \"Past bookings\" in my GWR account shows the booking reference and date of travel but NOT the TICKET NUMBER. I even went to the Paddington ticket office and spoke to a supervisor to ask for assistance, but he said they couldn't print a duplicate copy of my ticket because what I had bought was an ADVANCE TICKET. This supervisor was sympathetic to the fact that my ticket on the app had been wiped by itself and that the email confirmation had no PDF attachment. He even looked up the online schedule of train delays and confirmed that this train (No. 1A84) from NTA to PAD on 5 December was indeed delayed, and assured me the information was verifiable in the system. \n\nFortunately, before the trip, I had gone to Paddington to change to an earlier train for the return journey (NTA-PAD). The person at the Paddington ticket office was kind enough to write down the ticket number (starting with A-xxxxxxxxxxxx) on the back of each seat reservation stub. Thankfully, because of that, I do have the A-xxxxxxxxxxxx number, but it is handwritten and not printed on a ticket.\n\nSo, I scanned those seat reservation stubs with the handwritten ticket numbers and submitted them on Delay Repay. But I got a rejection again. The \u201cUnsuccessful\u201d email said: \u201cYour claim has been checked using a set process and the details of any delay verified using industry systems holding historic train running information. We have reviewed your claim and can confirm the following: \u2026 Decision: Unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nThe fact is the train conductor on the NTA-PAD service scanned my QR codes when doing ticket checks, which should prove that my partner and I did indeed travel on that particular train on that day, on that particular booking reference. With all this being electronic, the information is there and verifiable. \n\nWhat is in theory a straightforward process is made impossible by the fact that: (a) Delay Repay insists on having the ticket (not just the booking reference); (b) GWR's email confirmation failed to attach a PDF of the ticket like they claim it did. The \u201cAction Required\u201d system-generated email saying that I needed to produce a copy of the ticket stated \"A PDF of the ticket(s) purchased should have been emailed to you.\" Well, \"should have been emailed\" isn't the same as it actually having been emailed! (c) the app wipes out all QR codes and associated ticket numbers after the journey has been completed; (d) our past bookings in our GWR account only provide the booking reference but NOT THE TICKET NUMBER! B-D above show how impossible it is to get hold of the ticket. Why insist on us producing it when you are so keen to erase all record of it? I suspect this is designed to make the process difficult so as to keep GWR's compensation payments to a minimum. I also wonder if the non-PDF-ticket bearing email was on purpose so we couldn't produce a ticket to make a claim.\n\nAnother fault with Delay Repay is that it doesn't have a box for explanations. It only accepts a scan of a QR code or upload of an image/PDF. There\u2019s no way for one to tell them \u201cI can\u2019t provide the ticket because of X\u201d (though I suspect it's set up that way on purpose). GWR customer service repeated the same lines: that the email confirmation should have a PDF ticket attached (no, it didn't!) and that I'd be able to obtain it from my GWR account (again, no!). \n\nThose purchasing advance tickets online should bear in mind that the QR code & ticket number disappear from the app once the journey is complete. Print paper tickets at the machines so you have a hard copy!\n\nAnd beware the Delay Repay sham!",

        "review_text": "On 28 July 2022, I was subjected to degrading and upsetting behaviour by a GWR staff member.\n\nI was unable to scan my eTicket to leave the platform side, so I queued up to get help from the GWR staff member.\n\nAt least one customer pushed in front of me. The GWR staff member allowed this to happen. When I came to the front of the queue, another customer, who had been idle and allowed several customers to go before them, suddenly berated me for pushing in front. I apologised for not noticing this customer.\n\nWhen I approached the GWR staff member for help with my ticket, I was told to scan it. I tried to explain that I'd already done this but the staff member was disinterested.\n\nWhen I unsuccessfully scanned my ticket a second time, the GWR staff member finally decided to do something to help me progress. Unexpectedly, the staff member decided to put on their glasses to carefully inspect my eTicket, something which they did not do for other passengers with ticket scanning issues.\n\nWhen I passed through the ticket barriers, the GWR staff member berated me for pushing in front of the previously-mentioned customer. Given that other customers had pushed in front of me without challenge, I found the GWR staff member's intervention to be nonsensical and upsetting.\n\nWhen I approached the station helpdesk to raise a complaint, I was instructed to re-approach the GWR staff member I wanted to complain about in order to raise my complaint. I challenged this but was told again to do as instructed.\n\nI re-approached the GWR staff member to advise that I wanted to raise a formal complaint against their conduct. The GWR staff member appeared indignant and stormed off to get another member of staff to take my complaint. I could hear raised voices behind the ticket barrier wall.\n\nWhen I raised an online formal complaint against GWR and their staff, I waited over 4 weeks to receive an acknowledgement of my complaint.\n\nGWR failed to offer any compensation for the experience I had with their staff. This was because they \"don\u2019t offer compensation for staff complaints\".\n\nI decided to take my formal complaint to the Rail Ombudsman. GWR decided to offer \u00a325 in rail vouchers as compensation. I declined, because I did not value my upset at \u00a325 and I did not want \"store credit\" for a company I am actively avoiding.\n\n---\n\nIf GWR employ staff like the one who bullied me, with that person possibly being a supervisor, then it speaks volumes about the calibre of people that GWR employs.\n\nNeedless to say, I do not recommend GWR (Great Western Railway) to anyone.",

I needed to attach a LETTER from my GP stating I was ill.\nIn these times, when we hear the NHS is on their knees with work, my GP would have been outraged to have to provide a letter.  Indeed their advice for the flu is, \"Get in bed an deal with it.\"\nGWR should be ashamed!!  Did they learn nothing during lockdown!! about communicable diseases!\nI am pursuing this with GWR.

The staff are invariably helpful and friendly, trains are clean and on time.\n\nYesterday I left my case on the platform after helping a young mum into the train.\n\nI contacted GWR who were incredibly helpful, keeping me updated on the search.  They kept my case safe for my husband to collect.\n\nI think this is great service.  People are quick to criticise when things go wrong but I have always been happy with the service provided.  Thank you GWR",

The train was delayed at Swindon for about 40 minutes due to a missing driver, so I put a claim on their delay repay website.\nThe website wouldn't let me search for trains to Gloucester to I put in the train to Cheltenham, and uploaded my ticket to Gloucester. They denied my claim as I used a split ticket, despite the fact they well know that there is a rail replacement service from Cheltenham to Gloucester. There is no way to add comments to my claim, and when you call Customer Service they say use the delay repay website. The entire compensation system seems designed to not compensate people, but frustrate them instead. Considering they have a monopoly on the line they can get away with this tragically awful service, because what choice do we have?\n\nLet's not mention that at Cheltenham I missed the rail replacement service as the staff had locked the gate that leads to the car park, despite their being a sign to go through that gate. I then had to wait 30 minutes for the bus replacement.\n\nSo I lost 60 minutes of my journey. I tried claiming for 30. They rejected it on a technicality, unaware that there was a rail replacement on that service and making out it was my own fault. They'll get away with it too.",

And in the end of Tuesday my boss told me that there would be train strike and asked me don't go to office for the whole week. \nToday on 11Oct I went to the counter and asked for refund for the days I didn't take any tain from 5Oct to 9Oct. But the counter refused and gave me a form for applying DelayRepay. That form is the most tricky one, start from it it said 'If you did not travel, you need to apply for a refund instead of compensation. Refunds should be requested from the place you bought your ticket.' Or go the gwr.com refunds portal. I tried that gwr.com refunds portal, but on last step you couldn't ever see a submit button for refund. That is cheating people.\nAnd the counter said you should try DelayRepay, but on that DelayRepay portal, it states that you can only claim 'DelayRepay' after you have travelled.\nThis is dead loop here, the counter they don't let you refund for the 'Train Strike Action', and the GWR 'Refund portal' never allow you submit the claim, then their 'DelayRepay' portal also never enable the 'Submit' button even you have sumit the photo of touch card.\nThis GWR and the whole railway system is so corrupted and greedy, they are cheating people, service is completely bad sometimes you have to stand from Reading to London for the 30 mins, but they charge you so much expensive fee. Why the government can't get it nationalized?",

        "review_text": "Love, love, love the Great Western Railway! \nMy wife, myself and 2 friends had to take the train a few stops. When we approached the platform a GWR employee named Busola asked if we wanted a free sandwich from a large container full of drinks and sandwiches. I thought it was for those less fortunate so I said no. Busola continued to explain however that it was for everyone to enjoy and this was because of the Queen's passing. She went on to explain that whenever there was a holiday or special commemorative event that the GWR gave away free food and drink. Busola was so friendly we ended up chatting a bit before our train arrived. Of course we had a delicious sandwich too and enjoyed them on the train with a clean table and comfortable chairs. We will definitely ride the Great Western Railway again in future and we hope you're working Busola when we come through! Thank you so much Busola and the GWR!!",

        "review_text": "I boarded the train from Cardiff to Paddington at around 2pm. Loads of people got on and all the seats were taken up when I got on with my suitcase. Me and another guy were both with a suitcase and stuck in the doorway because people were standing in the corridor of the carriage. The suitcase stand was full so we were left standing in in the doorway unable to move. The train guard came along from the First Class carriage and demanded we moved down. Is he blind because it was too full to move down especially with a suitcase. We told him we will try but we have to wait till there is less people. He said no go now as we were blocking the doorway but we said we can't it's too full. I said can we not just stand in First Class as there was space there he said no you don't have a First Class ticket. How ridiculous. That would of solved the problem but him being a Tory snob said no. I don't get why we couldn't we are not using the First Class privileges like the seats or free drinks and it would of sorted the health and safety. Obviously snobbery comes before health and safety according to him and maybe GWR. In the end me and the other guy waited in the doorway with the guard lingering around us and we eventually moved down after ages. But it could of been sorted straight away by moving us to the First Class carriage were there was loads of space to at least stand without blocking a door. But this snob could not have that. It makes me angry that everyone says oh don't drive it's bad take the public transport. Yet this is evidence as to why I will not do this.",

The excuse was that a 10th coach had been attached to the 9 coach train. Although this was initially frustrating, the extra carriage sounded as though it would be helpful as the train was expected to be busy due to strikes. \nVery quickly the train filled up, which meant there was no space for luggage or people. My luggage was taken off the train to make room for another person's suitcase, and luckily I noticed this otherwise my belongings would have been left at Plymouth. There is just no way that you can keep an eye on your belongings, which also highlights that if there was a suspicious package, no one would know or be able to escalate this- again putting customers safety at risk.\n The air conditioning is not  working and there is no way to purchase water, for a 4.5 hour journey this is unacceptable and dangerous. Furthermore, there are no access to bins or toilets and there are people piled up like animals. \nIf an emergency was to occur, it would be a tragedy as there is absolutely no way that ANYONE can access emergency points. \nThere is no food carriage, or any way to purchase water. Understandably, passengers are becoming irate because we are literally being treated worst than cattle. To make matters worse, WE are having to pay for this treatment. \nThere is no justifiable reason for this horrific journey. GWR are opportunistic, greedy and do not care for their customers safety one bit. \n\nI think that everyone on this journey should receive a full-refund for this journey and GWR should stop exploiting there customers, by regulating how many tickets are sold.",

        "title": "Rude disminatory staff shouting at me...",
        "review_text": "Dear Team,\n\nI want to bring a matter to your attention regarding my journey today whereby I was mistreated by staff. \n\nI was heading from Plymouth to London at 16:50 today: 12/08/22. The train experienced a half an hour delay today and staff checking my ticket instructed me to move from first class to standard. However, someone was sitting in my reserved seat there. Staff passing by told me that twice as they were handling the trolley. I was unable to go the first time because people were in way. The handling trolley was in the way the second time. In the third instance, the older brown haired lady in a ponytail with glasses rudely yelled and shouted at me \u201cyou still haven\u2019t moved!\u201d. I know I\u2019m a younger adult, but she does not need to yell at me especially when I couldn\u2019t move on the train. I don\u2019t know whether she had a bad day, but I apologised for the inconvenience. I had to sit in a seat that wasn\u2019t mine because the person was not going to move. What can I do about that?\n\nAnother man was also sitting at the end of the first class section; and she and other staff did not check his ticket as he was in the toilet when they were checking and he was also sitting in a seat in first class where it said \u201cavailable\u201d, as were others. I honestly feel upset and discriminated because of my minority ethnic or religious background. If others could sit there and they weren\u2019t supposed to, why was I yelled at rudely?\n\nI sat in a seat that wasn\u2019t mine in another GWR train multiple times however I\u2019ve never been treated this rudely before and shouted at. Today I experienced a delayed and nearly four hours journey I was not going to sit on the floor. Please see that your staff are trained on etiquette, customer service and discrimination training would be good. No customer should be shouted at by staff when paying over a hundred pounds for a train ticket and be discriminated on. I would like a total refund. \n\nTicket number: TTC7RSP9FPT",

Every point of contact is designed to put you off claiming - the delayed payment website which *does not work*, the long holding times on the phone, they \"lose\" the information when you make a claim by telephone and you are forced to be on the phone for over half an hour just to lodge your claim. They don't answer emails at all, so you have to phone up again. My claim has taken over a month and endless hours of my time, with over 10 emails unanswered by the completely useless GWR contact team. Only escalation to an Executive complaints handler finally got me my payment and any proper communication. \n\nGWR also initially falsely recorded the delay time internally as \"1 minute delay\" when it was over 20 minutes. I questioned this - I suggest every customer does too. Do NOT believe their own records.\n\nIt gets even worse. In addition to all of this, while stuck on a very hot train for nearly an hour whilst it was sat at a station awaiting a new driver after GWR messed up on that too, the refreshments trolley \"Host\" refused to serve anyone desperate for water or food who left their seat and approached her. She said she would eventually come to us, but she failed to. I was ill from the effects of heat and dehydration as a direct consequence of her refusal to serve us.\n\nScandalous from start to finish.",

        "review_text": "My train was cancelled so I had to take the following train. On my journey to my destination I received an email telling me I could claim a refund. When I tried to fill out the form it wasn't working so I reached out to GWR via Twitter to ask for help - which I have proof of. On my way home I tried again and the website was working so I connected to the train's WiFi and filled out a form, in fact I have a screenshot of the compensation part of the form.\nI then set a reminder for 1 month to check on the progress of this refund.\n1 month later I reached out via Twitter to ask when I would receive my refund.\nI was told no refund had been logged to \"clear browser cookie and cache\" and try again again, but by this point I learned it was over 28 days which is the GWR time limit for applying for a refund. The agent telling me to clear my cache makes me think that this might be an issue they've experienced with other customers, that my claim was correctly submitted but that something went wrong in their end, particularly because the website wasn't working a few days prior to me submitting my claim as I know for 100% that I filled the form in. I have been trying to fight this case with GWR since May 24th and its still going on because they take so long to respond, and the gaps are getting further apart - 3 days, 5 days, 8 days, 24 days and now 5 days and waiting.. - it's ridiculous. And each response is restarting the conversation from scratch, dragging it out further, perhaps to make me give up? I won't. I've now reached out to an Obudsman to look into this case and their refund practices. My advice to others would be to keep a close eye on the progress of your refund and reapply/reach out long before the 28 days end to check on the progress of your claim. Going through these reviews, I see many others have very similar situations which I plan to share with the ombudsman and I reccomend you do the same!",

        "review_text": "What an absolute joke and possibly not even legal!\n\nImpossible to claim delay compensation because of GWR\u2019s own rules. \n\nThe delay compensation that a person can claim needs a copy of the Ticket which gets kept by the barriers / turnstile at the final destination, making it impossible to claim for the delay.\n\nEven a copy of the receipt for buying the ticket at the station by card, will not be accepted because GWR say there is not enough information on the receipt, even though it is GWR that decide what information to put on the receipt. Is this done purposely to stop people being able to make a claim?.\n\nIn my situation, I had the receipt showing I bought the ticket in person at London Paddington at 15:19 and paid \u00a365.20 for a single which is the correct fare to Weston Super Mare on the 15:32 train. Later trains would of been cheaper. This means that GWR can see I was physically in London Paddington at 15:19 and paid a higher fare to get on the 15:32 and naturally anyone wants to get hone and not sit in the station waiting around, especially having paid the higher fare for the next available train. They can also see by my home address I live in Weston super mare.\n\nThe 15:32 was late leaving Paddington and also terminated its journey early meaning that ai needed to get off and wait and get another train rather than one train all the way.\n\nHowever GWR who decide what info goes on their receipts have informed methat there is not enough info on the receipt and they are the ones that set the final destination barriers / turnstiles to keep the actual ticket, this making it impossible for anyone to claim, nice one!",

Only one train manager who had to cope with an over-crowded, declassed train full of irate passengers.  Sun 17th July, hot weather, but not the extreme of the following 2 days.  2 other trains heading south west were cancelled and their passengers redirected to my train (which appeared to be a shortened version of the usual train).  GWR clearly had no plans in place with to cope with the unusual circumstances. The station lacked staff as did the train.  Apparently one train manager is enough for a train.  A rule made by someone who does not appreciate what happens on trains.  The overworked staff on the ground were left to cope with an extremely difficult situation with no help.  People were complaining because they had seat reservations but other people were sitting in their seats. One male passenger was taking 2 seats, intimidating anyone who tried to sit down and harassing the young lady sitting opposite him.  The train manager could do nothing and when reported to them, the British Transport police did not want to know as no crime had taken place.  So much for their \u201cSee it, say it, sorted\u201d slogan.\nThe train manager did an exceptional job under difficult circumstances.  There were tourists from abroad who had been moves to this train and needed advice on connections.   2 older couples were struggling with the heat & crowding and she tried to keep an eye on them, providing water. \n\nClaiming for the delay was fairly straight forward although the amount given was paltry considering the awful journey.\nWhen I commented on that, I was told that there were rules re what could be paid. \n\nI will look into taking the bus next time.",

Not only was the process very difficult and I had to register for another account but it also took a long time and the platform was difficult to understand and to use. \nI then finally got a decision that I got a refund-in the form of an e-voucher. As I no longer live in the UK, I wanted a refund to one of the cards I had to register throughout the claim process. So I called the customer service. I was on the phone for 50 (!!!) minutes altogether, speaking to 2 people. One of them seemed understanding and willing to help, however could not change the reimbursement form so he redirected me to another department. After I explained my situation I only got a \u201cthis is in our t&cs, there is nothing I can do\u201d. I explained that I no longer lived in the UK and an e-voucher is GWR effectively robbing me as I am unable to use their services. Even though I purchased two tickets for both ways, the system somehow managed to show that these were single advanced tickets and hence \u201cthere was nothing GWR could do\u201d. I find this reimbursement handling and I also find it hard to believe there was nothing GWR could have done when I was asked to give 2 bank account details in my claim submission and even in the email I received after submitting the claim, it said that GWR always tries to reimburse in the same way the ticket has been purchased. This is a blatant lie and as a customer, I woyld have had the right to get my money back when I asked for it, not having used GWR\u2019s services. Also, buying a ticket for both ways and GWR somehow still managing to have it sold as single advanced (buying a few days before the travel, what would it be: single immediate?) just so that they can rip off customers is not best practice! Very unsatisfying and disgusting claims handling.\nA never returning person (not customer) from the continent.",

Cancelling my accommodation took 3 minutes and was free. Please consider what improvements you could make and clarify why it seems people are striking for more money when they appear to get more than most people anyway? We need trains where is the plan for sorting this all out and when will you share that with the public.",

The train became solidly packed during this time with passengers standing. We were eventually told to change trains by the driver, to a longer train at Reading, as the longer train was being given priority to leave. We did as asked. The longer train then had to wait for a replacement driver due to delays. We eventually arrived in Paddington on the longer train. That evening I received an email telling me to request a refund. GWR are now saying I did not complete my journey by train and are refusing to refund?!\nUpdate. I appealed the decision. GWR have now agreed to my refund. However, they are not refunding to the card details I gave them, as requested on their form. They have chosen to send me a cheque. My daughter, who travels regularly with them was entitled to a recent refund from GWR and again, GWR sent a cheque. I can only guess in the hope that some will not bank the refund cheques.",

I requested a refund following the instructions on GWR website and am annoyed to say the least. 15 days later I have been contacted by email requesting I resubmit images of my tickets cut in half!! I foolishly thought that when my request for refund was resolved the tickets would become void and unable to be used for travel therefore making the need for the ticket to be defaced unnecessary. I do not see the need for companies, of which GWR is a prime example, to deliberately prolong the refund process. I personally think 7 days is an acceptable time frame.",

The train arrived at BTM 23:40 and the shuttle bus supposedly would arrive 23:50 and every twenty minutes after that  however after waiting one hour and being stranded at a very precarious spot we found out the bus did not run in the early hours and we had been wrongfully sold a ticket for that bus. We were slightly lucky as we were a couple but they had also done the same with a single female and a 18 year old exchange student. We eventually had to get a taxi as we would miss our flight, we have tried to claim but @GWRHelp declined to help and have not accepted responsibility for there misleading sale! We always use GWR but on this occasion we are very angry and upset that they have treated their paying passengers like this. Please please please be very careful especially if you are travelling on your own when booking this particular journey. We will think twice about using @GWRHelp again and will be contacting the @RailOmbudsman for further assistance",

No explanation, just no refund accepted. \u00a3400 down the drain. On their website it says they will refund the full amount less \u00a310 admin fee, which is still a con, but I can accept \u00a310, even \u00a310 per person if they want to be greedy, but not to give me any of my money back in times like these is basically theft. They are not a reputable business in my eyes. There is no competition so they are able to charge ridiculously high prices for a tiny cabin and can then just choose to keep the money if something happens to you which means you can\u2019t go.

I had received no notification of this and was completely unaware of this. I apologised and said I would renew it on the spot, with the conductor watching. He said that it didn't work like that and I had to buy a new, full price ticket (despite having already purchased a ticket at 2/3 of the price). He refused to charge the difference and refused to get a manager that I could talk to about what had happened. He said I could appeal the decision after if I disagreed. I asked him to please allow me to renew the railcard, as that would make my ticket valid, and that I had very little money in this cost of living crisis. I was forced to buy a new ticket and when I went to appeal this, was told I could not appeal a new ticket and this was my fault. So I was forced to pay twice for the same journey with everyone I was interacting with being incredibly rude and unhelpful. In addition, the train was completely overcrowded (people sitting on the floor), and there was no refreshment trolley as a result (despite it being a boiling hot day). The train was also late. I was charged \u00a3100 for this journey (Totnes to London). I was absolutely disgusted and will not be travelling with them again.",

They made my say out loud why i didn't have one and I had personal reasons for not managing to get one in time which I didn't want to say, but I was always going to buy a ticket!! I told them how skint I am... they then made me say my home address out loud in front of a carriage of strangers who were staring at me, I said I don't want strangers knowing my address (as I've experienced harassment) but they were just like \"oh...\" and then still made me say it out loud. I have mental health and learning difficulties and this was really embarrassing as I get anxious enough being out in public anyway. Then when I got to the station I tried to tell one of the staff there that I wanted to make a complaint in person and she was like \"there's not really anything we can do, I suppose you can talk to the station manager\" She gestured at the station manager standing next to her, who then promptly walked off very quickly! way to receive feedback... I guess this is the only way to get you guys to listen to me now. Still can't afford the fine....",

They got everyone on an earlier train to pick up the delayed one at Reading and continue our journey without delaying anyone. They kept us all informed about everything continuously and everyone working within any of the stations knew exactly what was happening and could point everyone in the right direction.

The journey to Reading ended up being delayed on route and diverted to Westbury where we were asked to switch to another train on an adjacent platform. The scheduled train was due to arrive in Reading just before 13.00. We eventually arrived at 14.10. By the time I arrived in Guildford I was an hour later than the original schedule. Applied for a refund via Delay Repay uploading the pdf copy of my ticket. Shortly after I received an email advising that my claim had been unsuccessful as 'the uploaded ticket was not valid for the journey undertaken'. What nonsense! The ticket had been checked by on-board ticket inspectors. I have appealed but don't hold out much hope. I suspect that I will have to pursue the matter via the Rail Ombudsman or Small Claims Court.",

        "review_text": "I am heavily pregnant at 8 months and had taken my son for a birthday (day trip) to London from Bath. As we all are aware, train prices are exceptionally high having been raised recently but as it was a birthday trip I had no problem paying the high return fairs, unfortunately I felt unwell during the day and with shooting pains was instructed by my midwife to return for a check up immediately. We caught the 4.32 Taunton train (an earlier train back to Bath)  it was relatively quiet) only to be accosted by the train manager ( who's shift was between Paddington and Swindon) He demanded we pay \u00a350 extra to continue our journey and when I explained my situation he had absolutely no interest or regard. He could obviously see how pregnant I was and in considerable discomfort, He then threatened to eject myself and my son at the next station to wait for 5 hours on the platform for the right train. For someone in management for GWR This man* demonstrated an incredible amount of hostility, discrimination, chauvinism, lack of empathy and dismissive attitude  towards not only women but also pregnancy and health and safety. Being forced to pay \u00a350 extra to travel two stops further with him threatening  to throw me off the train is a DISGUSTING abuse of power and quite frankly I will NEVER travel GWR again if this is their policy of grabbing cash over the safety and health of their passengers. BEWARE! seriously \nmisogynistic senior management aboard GWR train services. This particular service went on to have significant delays on track stopping for over 30 minutes both at Swindon and just outside Bath which caused even more anxiety and distress both emotionally and physically. The next train manager ( a lady) was much more compassionate but asked me to lodge a formal complaint online ...I received an automated reply stating I wouldn't receive an official  response for 4 weeks!!!!! I am outraged and appalled at such blatant discrimination, greed  and lac of care from one of the largest rail networks in the country. The least I can expect is a personal apology and a refund but I highly doubt either of these will be on the cards.",

The conductor made no further checks.\n\nThird, the onboard catering was awful. Limited choice - far less than the standard class trolley service.\n\nIn sum I won't use GWR First Class again as Srandard Class is broadly equal.",

It is a normality rather than exception. For them everything shorter than 15 minutes delay is absolutely daily routine. There are even more nasty tricks they're doing to their customers. They can change the platform within literary 1-2 minutes from the departure time very often leave you no time to walk between the beginning and end of the station. Did someone from GWR thought about disables and prams? I have used SWT trains and GWR service is not even close. Their timetable is all over the place. It looks like they do not now what to do if even slightest thing on rail go bad...

        "review_text": "My son (18) recently travelled back from Bodmin Parkway to Paddington to return to University from a family holiday in Cornwall.  He was travelling with an adult ticket +16-25 year railcard.  When the ticket inspector came round to inspect tickets, he could not locate his Railcard on his phone wallet as he had recently got a new phone. He called me for help (he is dyslexic and has mild ADHD) and I forwarded the receipt for the Railcard and the reference for the card.  I also sent him a copy of the railcard from my phone.  THe inspector would not take this from him and refused to talk to me on the phone.  My son was verbally abused by the inspector which was embarrassing in front of other passengers, who seemed horrified by this.  He threatened my son and made him pay \u00a325 cash as he could not find the actual railcard.  He was told he could get this money back at Paddington.  The ticket inspector then exited the train at the next stop.  My son was really shaken by this but went to the Ticket office to get his \u00a325 refund.  He was told he could not get a refund and was given a \"Delay Repay\" form which is the wrong form.  I have complained on multiple times to Great Western Railway (online as there is no phone number to contact them) and I have heard nothing.  I still have not received the refund for the excess he had to pay.  My son is living on student grant, and a full time student.  This is outrageous behaviour and there Great Western Railway have done nothing to act on the complaint or refund his money.  BE CAREFUL TRAVELLING ON GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY.  Inspectors apparently receive commission for all the excess payment they can get from travellers.",

This rabble do not deserve to run a line as busy as this. \n\nIn short, the level of delays from GWR is quite frankly a disgrace. Delayed trains are the norm; on time an exception all underpinned by friendly but poorly informed staff who will try, but invariably fail to help.\n\nOccasionally, despite best intentions, they may even hinder your journey by sending you on a travel merry go round that leaves you really stranded.\n\nAvoid GWR and the stations they run from if you can.\n\nMay I suggest unicycling along the M4 as a safer, faster, cheaper and certainly more reliable way to get home.\n\nAnd do please do utilise delay repay every single time you're delayed.",

I rang customer service they don't change tickets but I change them at a station. I live four hours away!\nTwitter agent said buy two new tickets and cancel the ones I have and fill in a form to get reimbursed! It means I have to pay again for more tickets and they will cost more than the original ones I bought!\nWhat is going on with GWR?\nA change of train time on a journey should not cause so many problems!\nI am not prepared to spend more money! Why isn't your app and website conveniently not working when it comes to making changes on train tickets? However, it works if you want to buy tickets. Disgraceful!!",

        "review_text": "GWR used to be a decent train operating company, but since mid-2020 their conduct towards customers has seen a dramatic decline.  Most recently my wife and I used GWR to travel to Heathrow airport. We were greeted by a poster telling us to wear a face mask, even though this is no longer mandated by the UK government.  After buying our (rather expensive) tickets, the barrier attendant made the snide remark 'I don't know how you'll get all that luggage on the train' (we were within the luggage limits specified in the National Conditions of Carriage and GWR policy, travelling on a quiet and large train with ample luggage capacity).  We were then greeted by a poster advising us that simply staring at someone is now considered sexual harassment and perceived offenders would be reported to the police.  As I was moving our luggage along the corridor (no GWR staff had offered to help), another member of GWR staff decided to declare an item 'unattended' even though I was nearby and the luggage was within eyesight at all times.  He then became aggressive, lectured me that this was a major security hazard (this was at a provincial station not a major London terminus) and I wasn't allowed to bring so much luggage, though I knew full well I was under the conditions under which I had bought my ticket.   I said I was sorry for the disturbance caused and asked that he apologise too, reminding him that I was a customer - he declined and continued to be abusive.  Sadly this is not an isolated incident.  Earlier the same week, I witnessed a train manager spend twenty whole minutes giving a formal caution, to be followed-up in writing, to another customer simply because he had bought a ticket with disabled discount without a disabled rail card (this customer remained calm and co-operative throughout).  Furthermore, over the past two years, I (along with other customers) have frequently be threatened with fines and physical eviction from GWR trains by the British Transport Police if we fail to adhere to COVID regulations.  At times when these regulations were no longer mandated by the UK government, GWR staff accused those who didn't adhere to them of 'not respecting others.'  This has been accompanied by ubiquitous announcements, posters and platfom-mounted roundels promoting a COVID narrative that went well beyond anything sanctioned by official government policy and could be viewed as pschological abuse.  It's not the service I expect from a company I spend \u00a31000s a year to travel with (usually with little or no luggage).  Cancelled, over-crowded and late trains I can accept; abusive behaviour towards customers I cannot.",

        "review_text": "I am a regular traveller between Bristol and Paddington. First the positives: by British standards, this is a reliable railway. I travel every week and generally my trains run to time and are rarely cancelled. Here endeth the positives. Standard class passengers on the new intercity express trains can look forward to levels of comfort comparable with a park bench placed underneath a light source brighter than the Sun. It\u2019s clear that absolutely no attention has been paid to passenger ergonomics. The seats lack any thigh or lumbar support and are way too hard and upright. These same seats are used in commuter trains on the Continent and are not fit for intercity purposes. The arm rests are at the wrong height and anyway offer no comfort given they are made of a hard plastic over metal with no cushioning. As mentioned previosuly, the lighting is bright and ice cold. Combine all these factors together and even a sufferer of acute narcolepsy would struggle to rest, nevermind sleep in these moving torture chambers. There is no buffet car and the trolley service - if it appears (big if) - never has any sandwiches left. The staff make the best of the situation but there is no polishing to be done of these turds for trains that we are now lumbered with for the next 30 years. Whoever at the Department for Transport is responsible for procuring these mobile gulags should be made to spend the rest of their lives living in one.",

        "review_text": "Swansea to Paddington with GWR return. First time I'd been on this train since they retired the Inter-City 125s. I can honestly say the new trains are worse for passengers. The comfort level is poor. The standard class seats are like those on London commuter services, Ok for 50 mins, but not for nearly 3 hours. They foam is already compressed so you are sitting on steel and it feels like concrete. If you don't have back ache when the journey starts, you do by the time it ends. Really uncomfortable. Did anyone at First Group actually try sitting on one of these for 3 hours before they bought them? Compared to the seats on the West Coast Pendlino trains that Virgin Trains ran, that I would score as 8 out of 10, for comfort the GWR seats are 2 out of ten. Also the carpets are disgustingly filthy - they desperately need deep cleaning. Again on West Coast Virgin did that regularly. Now Avanti (First Group own part of Avanti) have taken over West Coast, no doubt standards will be dropping there too. The ticket cost an arm and a leg, far more than a comparable distance on West Coast. Why? To finish off, the lighting is a bright white LED. Come day or night it's on. Impossible to doze or sleep properly. Passengers have no control over it. Hopeless. Contrast GWR with West Coast - on West Coast each passenger has their own light so they can sit with it on or off. Much better. GWR are treating trains as if they are buses on rails. They are not. A train coach should have the same comfort as a road coach, not a double decker local bus. NEVER AGAIN. Just AWFUL.",

        "review_text": "I have had absolute shoddy treatment by this company. I'm not a train user and certainly won't be after this experience. I bought a return ticket through a company called Trainline for a service into Paddington from Bedwyn. In retrospect I realise I was travelling at peak time with an off peak ticket, a genuine mistake, that wasn't made clear to me on the app and they took my money for this ticket. At the station machine I couldn't retrieve my ticket with the numbers given by Trainline. On the train the conductor told me I had purchased the wrong ticket and to sort it out at Paddington. There I explained my situation saying it was a genuine mistake and I was happy to pay the balance. This was not accepted. I was told Trainline would sell any ticket regardless for what time, line etc!  I was asked to pay the full fare of \u00a350+ which I refused. I gave my address and now GWR are threatening me with court action if I don't pay them \u00a3139.55. Been told to take up the matter with Trainline.........I have not been given a fair opportunity to redress this, I have tried.\nIf you purchase an airline ticket via a third party, a travel agent for example, you would expect the airline to accept your ticket! They always have done in my experience.\nWhy does GWR allow their tickets to be sold via Trainline and then not honour the purchase? \nWhy would GWR not accept a genuine mistake?\nNever again.",

They make you pay for reserve Seat when the seat isn\u2019t available because they\u2019ve reduced the carriages. So I had to collapse on the floor as I couldn\u2019t stand any longer with my heart condition.\nThey make you buy ticket for trains that don\u2019t turn up and then you don\u2019t get a full refund amazing how a scam/ poor service like this can keep going on and on and on and on and on.  Train stations without ticket machines and then overcharging children who haven\u2019t got a ticket because there was no machine at the station. To say a poor show is not enough. If only we could all boycott the most expensive terrible service in the UK in my opinion. They never reply to Complaints to find out what the issue is. And probably they don\u2019t care",

On the 20th June I had an unexpected arthritis flare-up and was in considerable pain. I cancelled the holiday - the B+B Hotel immediately agreed we could switch to other dates at no cost. I know the ticket type with GWR did not provide for a refund. I booked the B+B for 4/10/21 to 6/10/21. I asked GWR if - in the circumstances, they would switch my tickets - I was happy to provide medical evidence - they refused and offered me nothing whatsoever. I paid ANOTHER \u00a3194.80 for the October journey. I also have to say it took repeated calls to GWR to get any type of response - they effectively have NO real Customer Service Team.\n\nGWR deserve to lose their franchise.",

Anyways on realising his mistake Chippenham rang Bristol and we drove there to collect only to find they hadn\u2019t rung the lost property but the train coordinator who has now gone home! Disaster! But we talked to the train supervisor, Ian who worked out where the train was now (on its way back to London) phoned the train manager in the train a lady called Tracey and tracked down said missing suitcase. Another gentleman in the office (sorry I didn\u2019t catch his name) then phoned the manager on the returning train (London to Weston super mare) and Ian collected it from him for us as it passed Bristol again.  Fantastic team effort from conscientious staff. Thank you to Ian and his team. \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf81",

The amount of people trying to get on a teatime train with 3 carriages was crazy. We were the first on the platform and the only ones who couldn\u2019t get on the train as people would not move along the carriages and the staff didn\u2019t move them. This left 5 woman, one 6 months pregnant and a 75 year old stuck on the platform for more than an hour to wait for the next train, with no guarantee we would be able to get on that either.\n\nGWR charge so much for the train and should not be able to sell tickets if you cannot have a seat. \n\nProfiteering at its worse - money over the safety of their passengers.",

I had to book another ticket and apply for refund which will take 28 days. Coming up to christmas, Cardiff to Paddington return tickets are not cheap. I have to go to London for work but cant afford this. Lady not interested. I said I wanted to complain. She couldn't understand me so I had to use phonetic alphabet. If this was another industry such as financial services, the regulator would be all over it. Surely, they cannot get away with treating people so appallingly. As I havent been able to sort...guess what, as journey date is now closer, ticket prices has increased!",

So I arrived at the train and asked the conductor if that was possible, as there clearly were quite few free seats (double green lights), her answer was flat no, but I \u201ccould buy full fare.\u201d When I protested that it was being quite inflexible the response was \u201cI don\u2019t make the rules\u201d. \n\nSurely some discretion and flexibility, where possible, can be adopted.

But they were both advance tickets which I learnt complicated things. Online amendment not suitable. Phoning hopeless, complaint process ridiculous (4 weeks later got answer to complaint saying cannot help as short staffed owing to covid (November 2021!). Read similar experiences from trust pilot with one review recommending Facebook page. Sent Messenger on gwr fb and within 5 minutes Jo replied with a link taking to a form for cancelling tickets which if submitted within 24 hours, amendment charge of \u00a310 each way would not be charged. 4 weeks later refund was in my account.

The ticket office staff Corrie and Jo were immediately friendly and obliging.  I had a very large suitcase with me and we briefly discussed my concerns about navigating the escalators on the London underground and Corrie suggested I enlist some help from one of the staff for my change of platform at Castle Cary which involved steps up and over the bridge.\nHaving provided my tickets, a few moments later, Corrie came on to the platform to let me know there would be no staff at Castle Cary to assist me and offered a solution, to instead change at Westbury where the platform change was a mere few yards at the same level.  The arrival time at Paddington would be the same.  She printed new journey information for me and endorsed my tickets.  These two ladies seemed to work together exceptionally well, provided great customer service, had excellent knowledge of the stations, trains and staffing and are an absolute credit to Great Western Railway.  I am indebted to them for my hassle free journey, thank you.",

If you are reading this GWR, hope you are a shamed by your poor service, this has now gone through the Railway Ombudsman which I hope your name is gone. Could have made it easier for yourself, but decided as always to not listen and not bothered to do anything. Will be driving than using the train. Never ever use this company unless you have to.

Later on into the journey conductor arrived only to find drunk passenger had no ticket and too was abused by him. Was told to get off at next stop....surprisingly didn't. Conductor didn't return and we heard him laugh as we pulled off and laughed an hr later when we arrived into London. There was also 2 other passengers who decided to get on this train early (never paid the extra and never got off) preventing a family of 4 sitting together around the table they too reserved.

        "review_text": "Just got home after a trip down from London on the 1848 London to Swansea service on 27th Sept. From the second we turned up at the dining car to the minute we arrived home, the whole experience was superb. The crew greeted me by name when we arrived at the door to the dining car, showed us to our table and got us settled. There was no rush to take our orders, nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel so welcome. Even though it is a limited menu, the food was fabulous. I had smoked trout to start, cod loin and plum tart for dessert. We jokingly mentioned that we enjoyed custard and they certainly obliged! The starter and main course were gorgeous and the dessert really was the metaphorical \"icing on the cake\". The chef even gave us an extra jug of custard to ensure we did not go hungry. Julie, Diane and Kay, you were superb. Absolutely superb! Chef was not bad either!  The \"Custard Boys\" went home happy and We Will Be Back! Thank you so much for making our trip so enjoyable, a real Dining Club atmosphere.",

After booking return tickets from Liskeard to Gloucester I noticed I had no reserved ticket for return leg Bristol Temple Meads to Liskeard on 11 th Sept .After numerous phone calls eventually a customer representative informed me via Twitter that ' nobody can reserve a seat on this train. This is totally contrary to previous information stating ..You must have  a seat reservation to travel !!! So frustrating to have wasted so much time trying to reserve a seat on this service. You can do better than this GWR.",

No Guard to be seen or heard on this service.\nAre GWR aware that there is a pandemic ?\nReturning on the 1710 from Southampton, there were no toilet facilities working on any part of the train and reportedly not to be fixed before the train arrived in Bristol. There was a Guard who offered to oblige customers with comfort stops at stations along the way. \"Please sir, I need a wee\".\nNothing like C21st travel on GWR trains!\nMembers of the GWR Board should try travelling on trains like these. Might it be pointed out that the service is for human beings and not for cattle. Noting, of course, that many services offered by GWR, at least those seen to be passing through Salisbury, would not qualify to carry cattle, as assessed against Health and Safety standards for livestock - too hot, too crowded and inadequately ventilated.\nFor many people, this service is a necessity in getting to Bristol, Cardiff, Southampton,  etc., perhaps to access the hospitals. They do not have the option to travel by other means, or to pay less elsewhere.\nHow about providing them with a service that is consistently fit for purpose ?\nIs this so much to ask for the ever-increasing cost ?!",

Tried to get on the website to complain and found I had to answer so many questions and upload my eticket onto the email. I couldn't do it so wasn't able to complain. You see, l don't actually believe they cancelled all those carriages because of staff shortages as there were plenty of stewards on the train. I believe it's because they couldn't fill the train so it was a cost cutting exercise. Not so many customers since covid and that's why they are advertising. Problem is they don't tell you GWR is not so great! And not hygienic. Go by car or bus!",

Not after the 19th July....I booked my ticket on the 4th July and bear in mind this was my first time on a train since coronavirus since I was so anxious about the covid rules....so on the 21st July 2021 I decided I would still take the train hoping things would go okay.  No they didnt.  As soon as I boarded I was verbally abused by another passenger and then the Train Manger of this train James proceeded to also harass, intimidate and bully me on the whole jouirney - I have never felt so scared abused and intimidated he was trying to force me off the train the whole trip and acted very unprofessionally and rudely - he obvious had some sort of agression issues and was shouting at me the whole journey.  Is this how GWR treat their loyal customers and abuse and harass them by their own staff?  It was outrageous and unacceptable. This specific train manager took it upon himself to bully and intimidate a young woman because he felt he had the power to do.  I am still awaiting my refund.  GWR have really gone downhill, the service is awful and ride and crowded on their trains.  No people were wearing masks, no social distancing in place at all.  Your trains are not safe this is not right with the Delta variant going around.  I will never use your trains or your service again.",

        "review_text": "On 5 July I bought an advanced first class ticket on line from London to Plymouth. I paid extra for the ticket to be posted to me as I did want the hassle of picking it up from the station. By 14 July it had not arrived. I telephoned their customer services and waited 20 minutes for the phone to be answered. After a discussion I was told that due to Covid19 Royal Mail was delayed. However I said this was rubbish as a few days earlier I had ordered some euros which had been delivered promptly. I was advised to go onto the website, ask for a refund and buy another ticket. I did so but was unable to get a refund because advanced tickets cannot be refunded! I therefore telephoned again this time waiting 30 minutes for the phone to be answered. I was told how to use the help to claim on the website. I decided to wait two more days in case the ticket arrived. It didn\u2019t so went online to book a new ticket. To my horror the price had increased by \u00a383. \nObviously I did not purchase one but telephoned again saying that no one had told me that the price would increase. My only option now I am told is to telephone the day before I am due to travel (and no doubt wait ages for the phone to be answered) to tell them my ticket has not arrived. I am told that it will then be a \u201cmanager to manager\u201d agreement that I can pick the ticket up from the station; something I did not want to do in the first place!\nIncidentally I have made a formal complaint on line and have heard nothing, not even an acknowledgment. \nWhy could they not have posted another ticket? Why couldn\u2019t they have emailed me a ticket?\nI will never book with them again!",

It's like they teach their staff to be rude and unfortunately they can afford to due to capitalism there are no alternatives. We all have to pay the ridiculous prices and then be treated appalling for the pleasure. I like trains but hate great western.",

Time after time it fails. Then you call GWR and after 40 mins they say they can\u2019t help you over the phone but you should go to the station. \n\nExcept that NO train station will help you change a GWR ticket bought on line even though the ticket office is operated by GWR. \n\nThanks to a wonderful man  whose identity I shall protect I managed to get a refund and compensation\n\nBut I shall never ever use this App again until GWR realises that in 2021 the only thing that matters  to a consumer trying to book on line is that its App is fit for purpose.",

Everytime I went to reserve a seat and pay, it would tell me there was an issue (though wouldn't tell me what that issue was) and it couldn't process the booking. After doing some research it seems you can't book more than 6 weeks in advance at the moment until timetables are confirmed. A little annoying but fine, I waited. \n\nWent to buy the tickets this morning and it finally let me reserve my seats, so I went through to the payment, confirmed through my banking app, and the GWR website said booking failed. Tried it again, and the same thing happened. Checked my bank statement and I have been charged TWICE and don't have a booking to show for it. \n\nI try to call their customer line, twice, and both times was waiting for an hour with nobody answering the phone. Tried to message on Facebook and Whatsapp as they otherwise recommend, and I did get a response here, though very unsympathetic saying I had to wait for the bank to refund me.\n\nTo add to the context here, each attempted booking was \u00a3250, so this is \u00a3500 I am missing at the moment, with no idea when it will be returned to me. All because they have a terrible website that doesn't work and an unresponsive support team.\n\nI then this afternoon get a response to a case I made 4 weeks ago asking why I couldn't book the train back then, and it says if I have any questions to email back, and to expect a response in 20 days. Laughable.\n\nThey are obviously understaffed, perhaps from making redundancies due to COVID. Obviously they don't understand that maintaining good customer service will keep people using your service, therefore this is not a department that you can afford to make cuts in.\n\nBooked in the end with Trainline and as always they are great and reliable so I have my tickets. Though am still \u00a3500 down.",

Do you think it's funny to do that in rush hour and at the same time remind customers about the importance of social distancing on board non stop??? Can your majestic staff not use the first class as usual and can you STILL not provide the right number of coaches??? I have never seen such a rude and terrible company like yours who couldn't care less about their customers. I truly hope one day you will have some real competition and your ripped off so called customers will finally be able to run away from you!!!",

Tried to get a refund or to change the day of travel on the day of travel however as the tickets cost less than \u00a310 and GWR charge a \u00a310 admin fee (for what? Processing a refund? Shops do this day and day out and don\u2019t charge) a refund couldn't be processed. Also GWR customer services would not change the date of travel, choosing to stick to policy. \n\nI made an application to them for both sets of tickets on the medical grounds that I was sick and they denied it saying the tickets were \"non refundable\u201d. Very convenient! \n\nI then asked for a deadlock letter so I could go to the Rail Ombudsman and Brad on GWR\u2019s Twitter account said \"I am afraid we cannot provide a deadlock letter because a refund is not due for your tickets\"\n\nThey cannot be allowed to get away with taking your money and offering nothing in return.

        "review_text": "My partner pre booked a train ticket as advised with covid, from Newbury to Cornwall. Due to being hard working and self employed, he was joining myself and our children a day later, so he wouldn't let a client down.\nHe wanted to dive down in his work van, but i convinced him to catch a train down after work and have a rest after a long day working. Also we could then travel home as a family which includes our disabled son, so making life a little easier. \nA few days before he got a message saying his train was cancelled, so he managed to change his ticket to a train which was running a few minutes later? Pretty much the same train! To be able to do this he had to pay an extra \u00a315 and couldn't get an allocate seat like he previously had! Seems like you just wanted to squeeze some more money out of him!\nOn the day of his travel, he left his van at work and got his very nice client to drop him off at newbury station to start his journey. On his way to reading station he was then informed the train he was catching next to Cornwall had be cancelled!!!!! So he was stuck at reading, and left stranded!!! We live in Benson, his work van was in newbury and his family in Cornwall. \nSo as there were no more trains that would get him to Cornwall that day, and even if there were he'd have to pay for another ticket as the people at reading said his ticket was non refundable and he'd have to contact gwr (which he tried, but waited 15mins trying to speak to someone on the phone before giving up). \nSo all he could do was PAY for another ticket to get him back to Newbury, where he started. And get a taxi back to his van and then drive all the way to Cornwall, in order not to disappoint our children. After a long day at work and wasting his time starting his train journey, which now seems that you really had no intention of running in the 1st place. Seems you like to take as much of peoples money as you can under false \npretenses.\nThis was our 1st time putting our trust in rail to do a long distance journey. After this massive let down and lack of any sort of decent customer service, we certainly wont be using rail again. We will stick to the roads! \nIn total he brought his original ticket for \u00a379.80.\nThen had to pay \u00a314.20 to transfer his ticket to a train running a minute earlier than the original. \nThen \u00a37.10 to get a train back to Newbury station after starting his journey. \nTHEN HE HAD TO FILL HIS VAN UP WITH PETROL TO GET TO CORNWALL AFTER YOU LET US DOWN TERRIBLY.",

Well, my train was 3\u00d7 the expected wait. I understand the incident with the bridge is not GWR's fault, but I do not believe we are treated equally. \n\nThe big London trains always have ample coaches and the trains I catch never have more than 3 coaches. We are crowded and standing up. It's impossible to maintain social distancing. \n\nAnd why, if any train is going to be delayed or cancelled, is it always the little Gloucester or Worcester trains?\n\nWhat I am saying is that it doesn't matter if you are first class, going to London or Filton Abbey Wood, we are all customers  and deserve to be treated equally.

Always friendly and reliable staff.\nCome 12/04/21 after countless journeys where everything is checked (keys, phone, wallet (the usual) then exit, on this day however I have now become that man - I left my \u201cApple Watch ON CHARGE on the seat. Not just any watch, \u201ca 40th birthday present from my daughter!!!!!\u201d\nFirst things first - I panic.... worry.... stress etc etc. I then do what all men do - say nothing and hope no one will notice! \nThen brain wave - google GWR lost property, click a link, add my details then sit back and try and not bring up \u201cI left my watch on a train\u201d into any conversation!\nI then find GWR on Twitter - I start my message with \u201cHi - this might be a long shot....\u201d give the details. I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s now getting quite late in the evening so wasn\u2019t expecting any reply until the morning after, if at all.\nLow and behold, minutes later,...... I confess etc etc, Mrs cursing, daughter shouting, scenes! \nA message comes through in all the distraction, so I go through my predicament about now being \n\u201cthat guy.\u201d\nThey promise to try and get hold of someone and get back to me ASAP. \nA little time came and went but unfortunately nothing in the evening. \nObviously during today I\u2019m randomly checking to see if I\u2019ve had any DM\u2019s.\nThis afternoon I had a message from Celia via Twitter, who had also taken my message the previous evening on behalf of GWR Team \u201cconfirming\u201d my watch had been found safe and will be held for me to come and collect at my convenience.\nExcellent news, Mrs happy, daughter jubilant, scenes! \nThe service I had throughout my \u201cordeal\u201d has been excellent. All staff that I spoke to directly or indirectly via Twitter certainly went the extra mile for me to help and I couldn\u2019t be more greatful!\nSo use the GWR lost property link - easy,\nThen always worth sending a message like my long shot.\nHappy days.\nThank you GWR!",

        "review_text": "For a long while I've loathed the fact that I'm what GWR would view as a 'captive customer': no alternatives to get from Cornwall to London but to use the train. Over the years GWR has been nothing less than appalling. However, on booking a short trip to London last November 2020, and experiencing usual difficulties online, I picked up the phone in great trepidation. I can only describe the experience that followed as something of a revelation. I spoke to people who knew what they were doing and actually, seemingly, genuinely wanted to help me. I was able to book a return journey without too much difficulty. Of course, HM Government then imposed a London lockdown so travelling on my dates was not permitted. I went online and found an option to apply for a replacement travel voucher: voucher because of the nature of tickets I'd booked but that was no problem for me. There then ensued about two months of the much anticipated GWR chaos, my application rejected, not valid tickets, cursory examination of my complaints, quickly dismiss with one line emails: much more like the GWR I'm accustomed to. I picked up the phone again. Another stroke of luck. Another GWR employee actually wanting to help me. After nearly three months, my issue was resolved within a couple of days. GWR has a long long way to go before I'm convinced it's much more than the awful company I'm used to dealing with. But there are glimmers of hope. Well deserved three stars.",

I was left waiting for a response too my complaint for 5 months. When they did get back to me I was met with an allegation of lying, fire backlash and an empty response stating that an investigation had taken place. When I asked for details of the investigation I was pushed to the curb. I was then told to stop emailing the team after asking them valid questions and calling them out on the fact they had actually overcharged me for my fine. Poor company. Racists.",

This is total wrong national rail states any booking for travel before September 6th will get a full refund from the train providers because of covid19. I don't know how they can think this is okay.

I recognise my mistake in having an out of date railcard, but the ensuing treatment and the punishment seems so far from the crime when a railcard costs \u00a330 to renew and they just seem to use the vast size of the organisation to squeeze the money out of me when i had just made a simple mistake. In order to fine me they also interviewed me under caution which was highly stressful, and the interrogator seemed to delight in this, no wonder as I have since discovered these conductors receive a commission when handing out cautions. They have treated me like a criminal when I am a high paying customer and show no sympathy or understanding as they look to extract every last pound from my pocket.",

        "review_text": "So somebody is abroad and is travelling to the UK and wants to buy a ticket with this lot. For delivery they give you the option to either post it to a UK address or pick it up from a machine/ticket office at the station. Great. So now you pay by Paypal and because you're not in the UK you can't have it delivered at your UK address so you choose the station pickup option. Excellent. Now we are in the coronavirus pandemic and things change from one day to the next so it turns out you can't come into the UK on the selected date. So now you're looking to change that ticket to a different date. Now the only option to have it delivered is via a UK address which creates a conundrum only they know how you can solve. \nSo you have a relative who can receive the ticket to their UK address and then post it to you so you pick that option. But they don't send you the full amended ticket, they send you an excess ticket which is not valid unless you have the original ticket. Nobody is going to tell you that you have to pick up the original ticket from the machine to use the excess ticket. And if you used Paypal as the method to pay then you cannot pick it up from a machine because there is no provision for that, you have to go to the ticket office and get it from there. But not all stations have ticket offices and they're not open 24/7, not even at the airports!\n\nWhy on earth can't they just issue an e-ticket for your devices countless other companies do and they use this archaic and convoluted system only they know. Perhaps they can't be bothered.",

        "review_text": "Quite alarmed by the rudeness and contempt that is clearly permissible by GWR. Myself and my partner were travelling from Cornwall and needed to make a change at Bristol Temple Meads. Having been on various trains over the course of 5 hours we were understandably rather tired by the time we arrived. We regularly travel so we are used to making changes and we are also familiar with Bristol Temple Meads. I arrived roughly in the area where we needed to catch our next train but was momentarily disoriented and looked towards my partner who was slightly behind me to confirm which platform we needed to be on. I was stood near, but not too close to a train on the opposite platform bound for London Paddington. Suddenly a tall GWR staff member wearing a black mask with short black hair launched himself at me and shouted \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d In a tone which suggested I am totally devoid of a brain. He was glaring at me so I took a pause as I couldn\u2019t work out why I was being spoken to in this way and for a moment wasn\u2019t even sure whether he was a member of staff owing to his complete lack of professionalism. He continued, again in a mocking tone, \u201cthis train will leave in a minute so you need to know where you\u2019re going\u201d, my partner then confirmed where we were headed to which the GWR member of staff pointed at platform 13 where the 2.39pm service to Great Malvern from BTM (the train we required, 23rd October) was arriving into the platform. \u201cThat one\u201d he spat, towards my partner. A much more helpful member of staff almost seemed to intervene at this point as if also dumbstruck by his colleague\u2019s rudeness and confirmed what we had just been told. As we went to board the train I remarked \u201cslightly rude, but thank you\u201d as I was disgusted at the way we had been treated. His anger came out of nowhere and we had not sought any help so his presence was a surprise. We would of been grateful for his assistance had it not been brought forward with abrasiveness and contempt. I was hardly holding up the other train as I was nowhere near it and after all, if confused passengers miss their train, that\u2019s their fault, so there was no need for any of his attitude. The situation was compounded by the fact that as our train left the platform and began on its journey we turned to the passenger window and clocked the same member of staff on the platform waving at the carriage and blowing a kiss! Perhaps this was jokingly intended for the driver of the train but as it came so soon after our minor altercation it seemed too much of a coincidence. The action also seemed to be deliberately sarcastic and however you cut it, it\u2019s rather strange behaviour! He clearly has little time for members of the public and is deeply dissatisfied in his role and he certainly should be nowhere near customers. He seemed to be fizzing with anger and attitude so I can only assume we were not the only recipients of his particular brand of charm this afternoon.  I would add I have never had a problem with train staff before and think they do a marvellous job, often under immense pressure. Coming from a customer service background myself I can appreciate that totally. However, I hope this complaint is taken seriously and the member of staff in question (whom, unfortunately I am not able to name) is given thorough customer service training and guidance on how to maintain his composure and control his anger.",

Great helpful, polite and always friendly staff, not afraid to remove passengers from the disabled seats either. That bit is a 5 star operation.\nHowever the actual train supply function is very much 1 star. Being very elderly and with one of us disabled we always travel from Weston Super Mare where we live to Paignton paying extra for 1st class travel for the extra space and service. We booked about a month in advance and checked each day to see if there were rail works etc. You can imagine our dismay on Monday 14/09 to find the train we were booked on had disappeared from the schedule and been replaced by one departing about 50 minutes earlier with one change or an hour later with two changes and the journey taking 3.5 hours instead of 1.5 hours. Our local taxi company got us to the staion in time to catch the earlier train and the Passenger Assist staff were very helpful indeed. NO FIRST CLASS until we reached Taunton. Same on the way back FIRST CLASS only for part of the journey. We really loved sitting on Taunton station for 45 minutes waiting for the train, it was only the Passenger Assist staff who kept us going. Why GWR seeing that you are getting money from the Government are you so uncaring of your customers and the damage you are inflicting on the West Country. Our Hotel had had quite a few regular guests cancel as they were unable to book suitable trains.\nThank you for the response nearly a month later however over a month ago I had complained to customer services and given them ALL details - nothing back from them at all after 5 weeks.",

How dare they assume I use social media?\nFortunately Trainline exists and I was able to buy a ticket through them without any problems.\nThe outward journey did not go well. As we boarded the conductor told us to move forward as the train would divide at Plymouth. We walked the whole length of the train to carriage A and didn't find another first class carriage which was annoying as we had paid for first class seats. While waiting for the train to leave I went to the toilet and could not unlock the door by pressing the usual lock/unlock button. I pressed the emergency button but no one spoke to me through the intercom. After a few minutes of waiting I called my husband (luckily I had my phone on me) who came and prised the door open manually. I would hate to be in a real emergency on GWR. Then there  a message was broadcast that the train would not divide after all. By this time the train was moving so we had to walk the whole length of it with our luggage. The conductor was very apologetic and found us seats together. He said the notice board had put up the wrong message. The return journey passed without incident, to my relief. A pity, as ten to fifteen years ago they provided a good service.",

Tickets bought in one station might be questioned in another one, expecially regarding the peak/off peak definition, which is not defined at all. The company takes advantage to the fact that they have the monoploly on some fares (not even buses), and the customer is not considered at all. For the same money I could have bought a used car and covered all the expenses to do the commute by car.",

I won\u2019t bother with them in the future and will go straight to GWR to book tickets.\nI did have a query and needed to contact GWR to seek clarification. \nIt clearly shows how you can contact them using Twitter / WattsApp / Phone or e mail. It states you can use WattsApp up to 11pm so at 9.15pm Saturday evening I sent them a message on WattsApp.\nI thought I would probably get a reply within a couple of days and was amazed that Josh in their customer service team replied within 30 minutes!!\nHis tone was very polite and he answered my question straightaway. \nThis really is awesome service and the best experience I\u2019ve had from any rail operator. Josh deserves some recognition for sure and thanks to GWR for making it all so easy. \nKind regards \nSimon",

Contacted the complaints department 10 days ago and no sign of life either. Considering that I have been furloughed on reduced pay and that the exorbitant cost of the ticket was covered by a season ticket loan that I still need to reimburse, this keeps getting worse. I'm discussing with my company a WFH schedule going forward so that I don't have to get a season ticket ever again because this experience, in addition to the crowded and delayed trains when they were functioning has been nothing short of appaling.",

However as I bought Advance tickets I\u2019m told I am not eligible for a refund. GWR Customer Services staff suggest changing my travel dates to a later date. Unfortunately the 12 week window for Advance tickets has disappeared and is only 8 days after my flight, so pretty useless.\n\nI\u2019ve paid for journeys I should not take. I can\u2019t get a refund. I can\u2019t book a reasonable alternative service. GWR have taken my payment and offer no reasonable travel options. Terrible company.",

        "review_text": "I've now been waiting 74 days for my season ticket refund, and I'm disappointed.  If the GWR Twitter page is anything to go by, I know I'm not the only person that has been waiting a significant period for their refund to be processed. \n\nI'm aware that the Refunds Team has received an unprecedented number of requests, but to keep customers waiting for their money for so long, and at such a challenging time, is quite distressing.  People have lost their jobs and have been furloughed - this money could be the difference in someone making their rent payment or buying food.  The lack of compassion and empathy for customers is both astounding and disappointing. \n\nAlso, I imagine many people with season tickets don't just have \u00a34k+ lying around - they use loan schemes through work to pay for their travel. What if people have been made redundant without paying off their season ticket loan?  Please, please, please have a conscience and give people their money back within a reasonable timeframe.   \n\n(The two stars are for the GWR Customer Service team - you've always been helpful.  Your responsiveness and customer care are much appreciated; it makes the silence from the rest of GWR on this matter all the more glaring.)",

GWR have failed to proactively contact me and when contacting them (several times) they\u2019ve given conflicting and woolly responses. Their sole accurate message being that they\u2019re received the claims but they\u2019ve been too busy to refund within the usual timeframe. They say they have had to double it. It\u2019s now nearly two weeks beyond the extended timeframe so that was wrong information . GWR need to understand that their customers have also been impacted by the crisis as well as them. Busy GWR will be. And no doubt fewer staff. Everyone can understand that brings challenges. However the extreme delay now begins to feel like poorly managed procedures at the least,  a reluctance to respect their customers and a seemingly  unwillingness to refund. With such overwhelmingly poor feedback GWR need to improve performance fast.",

For example, my pass is from 5th March to 5th April. I haven't travelled since the 10th of March, but I can only claim the refund from the 27th (today's date) because that's when I filled in the form. Also, they want you to send the ticket in the post, otherwise you cannot claim the refund.\nClearly, they are trying to make it as difficult as possible for people to get their money back.",

Every train I seem to use either gets cancelled or delayed that I miss my connection at Temple Meads. Forget the Delay / Repay mine got refused despite them cancelling the train !! A cancelled train is a breach of the ticket I brought, not a delay because I got the next train !!  they cancelled the service I was booked on so that's a full refund, just like buying anything when the goods/services aren't fulfilled. Despite the dreadful service, I was stuck in London and thus had to get a morning train back from paddington to Worle, my super saver was not valid and when I asked to upgrade so I could get the earlier train they would only sell me a new single ticket for \u00a3118 !!!!  and told i'd have to apply for a refund for the unused super saver !!!  they could have easily have just allowed me to pay the difference, totally unreasonable and the biggest rip off i've ever encountered, how can this ever be justified ? it's an utter scandal !! When I questioned this at the ticket desk, despite their embarresment at the cost, they told it's becasue they prioritise regular business travellers with annual tickets...unbelivable to even suggest this is a valid and fair excuse, the rest of us clearly don't matter.  If it's a peak train in this direction why was it only 1/4 full ??   I would encourage anyone to drive and look to blame the train operators for creating a service so bad and over charging customers at ridiculous ticket costs that the environment impact is on their hands, not yours.  Boycott them if you can, they deserve all they get and their demise will only be themselves to blame. Nationalisation can't come sooner to GWR. I await a copy and pasted reply from Bradley. They aren't interested in improving services, so I don't believe anything they say.",

Now becoming increasingly standard practice to run three standard class carriages London-Swansea: 4 of these of my 6 trips in recent months. Often no apology or explanation, with dozens standing. After months of disruption and claims about improved new trains and more seats, habitually running disgracefully short trains, with vastly less seats, and the seats themselves on new trains infamous for being probably the most uncomfortable in UK. A recent journey with 3 broken toilets, no water in basins, and severe overcrowding would be a tremendous way to help spread the coronavirus efficiently. GWR is almost certainly running these absurdly short trains to avoid outright cancellations, for which it would be financially penalised. The greatest advert for Renationalisation you could possibly imagine. No one would use this company if they had a choice.",

It services five stations it is staggering the amount delays and cancellations this service has. We are encouraged to use public transport more but with this service it is nigh on impossible for commuting to work.",

        "review_text": "The service on the Cotswold line to London Paddington is consistently dreadful. Trains are frequently cancelled, and when they do run their punctuality is woeful. As an illustration, out of the last seven journeys on the 8.27 Charlbury to Paddington, two were cancelled, two were more than 20 minutes late and none arrived on time.  I don't want to have to drive to Oxford Parkway, but when I do I'm always impressed by the fact that Chiltern trains arrive when they should and invariably reach London on time. It's an example of what can be done. Chiltern doesn't seem to suffer from the 'shortage of train crew' which GWR so often uses as an excuse to cancel a service.  (Chiltern also runs long distance trains from Birmingham and other Midlands stations which also have a strong reliability record). If anyone from GWR replies to this please don't tell me I can claim compensation.  I don't want compensation which, in any case, doesn't cover the stress and disruption. I just want a reliable service.  I hope that when it's time for a franchise review, GWR's record comes under close scrutiny.",

A restaurant on wheels perfect for seeing our beautiful countryside.\n\nMy partner and I were engaged at Dawlish Station on her Birthday, Sunday Januaty 19th.\n\nGWR saw our photos taken by Jimmy, Alex and Kerry, who were simply brilliant, so friendly, they even made us a cup of tea and spoke to us for approx 2 hours.\n\nGWR Head Office subsequently offered us the opportunity to be their guests on the Pullman Service & an extra treat the Night Riviera Sleeper from Penzance back to London Paddington.\n\nMatt at Penzance again was brilliant, very friendly and made us feel so welcome.\n\nThe train crew on the 13:04 from Paddington to Plymouth were exceptional, so much praise for them, attentive, professional and so friendly, Cristina, Ryan and Teresa to name a few, all staff were brilliant.\n\nThe sleeper service (2145 Weds 12th, Penzance to London Paddington) again was excellent, staff were lovely, especially the Lounge crew and Train driver Simon.\n\nI feel passionate myself about customer service and the ability to care for your customers whatever the age group.\n\nGWR were and are amazing, a family feel like company and amongst all the negative comments on reviews and social media spare a thought for the dedication the staff have to offer.\n\nTake time to compliment, few too many do, when a train is late negativity surfices.\n\nThank you so much GWR for creating a memory for Alexandra and I to cherish forever.\n\nTo all at GWR \"Thank you\" inparticular Dan & John",

I tried to download your app to buy a ticket but it wouldn't let me register my device to receive a e ticket. I arrived a few minutes before my train and there were ques for the ticket machines. I asked the barrier man if I could purchase a ticket on the train that was 1 minute away. He said no. I said that makes no sense, he looked at me like a peice of trash and said it makes perfect sense. So I qued to purchase a ticket and missed my train. Then I went back through the barrier and said Thank you to the barrier man for doing such a great job. And waited for the next train to arrive. It arrived late I got on and took my seat and a few minutes later the conductor came around to check my ticket, then he said I had purchased the wrong one at the station I literally just got the ticket from. And said he had to charge me more as the price was off peak. (I asked the ticket office for the next train to chippenham please). I then went onto the gwr website and showed him that I could buy the ticket right now online for the same price for the journey that I was on and he eventually gave up.\nNow finally I was alerted that you stated that I saved the planet by cutting my c02 emmsions. This is not true as my dad had to drive 1hr 10mins to pick me up and take me home from the station and my friend who dropped me off had to drive for 40mins. Total 1hr 50mins in driving. It takes 1hr 20mins to drive from my house to work and costs \u00a310. Unless you get the train then it takes 2hr 30mins And costs \u00a314.40 just for the train.

I spent several stressful hours trying to make that work, eventually sent an email to customer service with the issue. Got an email back a week and a day later, saying absolutely nothing helpful. I've been on hold for nearly 20 minutes and I'm so fed up of all of this. I wish I could take a different train, these train monopolies are disgusting and bring out a complacent side of these companies.\n\nEdit after Bradley from GWR replied to this review:\n\nNice to see that GWR can employ people to respond to poor reviews, yet they can't pick up the phone (if you call the GWR customer service desk it forwards to TfL because they don't do it in house apparently).\n\nBradley, love, chum, salt of the earth, do you not see that this is ridiculous? How can I be expected to chase GWR through their website, email, phone, Trustpilot and then to an obscure refund system or a ticket office? This is not how customer service is supposed to work, and this isn't how a consumer should be valued. I would probably be valued more if there wasn't a localised monopoly on every single train line.",

We are all stuck with them and there is no option, and as a return in first is 200 pounds plus, that is quite some joke GWR are having. Over priced, too slow, and seriously uncomfortable.

Firstly the service route purchased online didnt exist in reality (a good start), then queued until 3 minutes before departure waiting for the platform to be announced....then on announcement a \"Hunger Games\" melee brawl to get a seat. Once on board the train we have the joy of standing room only and passengers moving zombielike through the aisles searching in vain for a free seat as a shade of Hades tormenting the damned.\n\nMight I suggest that offering a rooftop option may complete the experience. At the present pricing standards of GWR it is only marginally cheaper than an actual third world holiday so allowing us mere cattle to hang from the roof would allow us complete immersion into the experience. On the plus side, this service offers a top notch educational role, my 12 year old now has an insight, however minute, into the horror trains of the third reich and soviet gulags. The fetid smell of the huddled and disposessed masses felt real and added even more to the experience....Perfect.",

Bearing in mind the 14:03 service to Penzance from Paddington was well and truly rammed beyond Plymouth in mid January (and this without Plymouth commuters I might add) this must surely prove the point.\n\nWhilst I agree that GWR increasing the number of services between Penzance and Plymouth is a good thing on this occasion it had no bearing on the passenger numbers on this particular service. You'll definitely be needing more nine and ten car trains as opposed to five car IET's.\n\nI had a seat fine however I was concerned about the use of five car trains during busy periods being a bad idea.

GWR's response to a review about the poor service between Maidenhead and Paddington is as follows: \"As part of the development of Crossrail services, 50% of GWR services were transferred to TfL in December and where as there are fewer GWR services, there are not fewer services overall.\" If the case is that GWR has transferred 50% of services to TfL then how come GWR rail fares have increased? Further, it seems that we are being penalised with the introduction of more TfL slow trains whilst not having the benefit of the Elizabeth line in central London actually being open (and allegedly only starting in summer 2021). Mmmmm...something doesn't feel right about that.",

I Commute from Henley to Paddington and used to always get a seat and have a pleasant journey. The new timetable now gets me into work and back home later than before, the prices have increased and I am constantly fighting to get a seat. The trains are completely packed all the time. This is ignoring the fact that the majority of the time the service is either delayed or cancelled.\n\nThere is no consideration for passengers when these cancellations occur. On the 8/01/2020 the 17:51 service delayed so much it wouldn't stop at Twyford. Anybody wanting to get to Twyford decided to take the 18:07 to Frome which arrives at twyford 18:27. The Henley connection train leaves at 18:27. We arrived at Twyford at 18:25, rushed to get onto platform to find staff had blocked entrance to it. By the time we ran round to the other entrance the train started leaving. Staff said they couldn't hold the train because we weren't on the connecting train. Even though the connecting train was cancelled. Somebody working for GWR should have had the decency once they saw all these passengers trying to get on an empty train to hold it for at least 2 mins, to allow passengers to not be delayed by 30 mins. No thought for the people who use there service\n\n*****UPDATE (later the same day)******\nI wrote this earlier today. Funnily enough I arrived at Twyford today from Paddington at 18:28, 1 minute late. Normally there is a 4 min window for connecting trains. Today the train left without us. Absolutely appalling.",

During the recent incident following a person being struck by the train like week there were no instructions in place and it was a stampede.\n\nI am only a small woman and was shoved into a train by much taller people in order to get home on time.\n\nThere was no structure, people who had been delayed for hours were muscled off the trains by later passengers who hadn't been waiting nearly as long and I myself almost got an elbow to the face when trying to board the first available train.\n\nStaff were useless, both men at the counter that day at around 16:00 saw me waiting patiently for answers and looked straight over me even when I called for help. I felt completely belittled and had to ask a fellow passenger to ask my questions as at least he answered her!\n\nThat's not all though, last minute calling of trains, I was at the station half an hour before my train, 5 minutes before it's due to depart they call it and again I get smooshed by fellow travellers as they are rushing too.\n\nI think I will just park in future and get the tube in as I feel completely let down by the service and you've lost my trust.",

Apparently GWR cannot make staff work Sundays (not sure about Saturdays) so quite often the direct trains from London to Cornwall are cancelled, leaving the poor (paying) customers to jump on another train, stand or sit on the floor, or not bother, which is a real problem if you are travelling with a family or if you are elderly - or let's face it, for anyone going on a long journey. I would love to speak to The person responsible, as this is not a one off, but a regular occurrence, as I know from experience. No other business operate this way. Perhaps they just don't care? I would love a reply, but I don't expect to get one. My advice is do not travel with GWR over a weekend if you want a specific service, or if you are travelling with children, or if you are travelling with elderly people, or if you are going on a long journey. They will really cock it up!!!",

First of all the boards don't work. Train was due to leave at 17:33 and we were told at 17:29 what platform it had. Like cattle all people were running and queuing to make it past the ticket control area. I didn't know that the seat reservations are not working. I am on train for over an hour and still don't know what coach I am sitting in. It's freezing cold in the coach, I mean it's nearly December. The interior of the new trains is very clinical, lights seats etc. To be fair never have seen anything more depressing like this for such a long journey. The seats - - no words for those. May as well sit on stone. And no Brad, I don't need your automated reply to the ergonomically designed seats. I mean Brad is a nice name for computer automated replies. The guy with the trolley barely made it through the isle. And don't even bother trying to sleep on the train. A. The seats will make sure you can't. B. Even if you that exhausted that you don't care about the seat anymore, the noise will keep you up. I am  listening to my music on maximum volume and can still hear the bloody train as an additional baseline to my music. Also no food car or anything. I mean who needs food on a 3 hour journey. Maybe the GWR wants us to loose a couple of pounds. No food car, seats so uncomfortable that you jump from a to b. Anyways what you pay for and what you get is more than appalling. There is no quality to this train or its journey. Considering that I am German, I have seen some really old trains and some really advanced ones in comparison. But no matter the age, always comfortable. Proper seats, plug sockets which actually charge your phone rather than pretending to, plenty of food in the food car and extra bike cars for the people with bicycles. Little advice, we have double decker trains, so you have the same length and actually more seats. Why don't you give that a go if you want to cramm in more seats. Anyway also had much nicer train journeys in Belgium and France as well. I mean my eurostar costs me 39 quid and I get a lot more out of that. \n\nSo yeah I will use my good old golf and drive next time. Ridiculous quality for a \u00a380 pound ticket.\n\nP. S. Brad I can't wait for your automated reply. - - - note: saying to me it isn't by replying with the standard name Brad for all replies won't convince me \ud83d\ude09",

Don't hold your breath: he/she contentedly purrs away sitting on the broad lap of the railway companies while singularly failing to notice anything amiss. So let's hope Corbyn, if he gets the opportunity, sacks the Regulator and confiscates GWR's network without providing any compensation to the shareholders.",

Unfortunately, this did not address the question that I asked, and would therefore like this to be raised as to a complaint.\nI have previously read your inaccessible terms regarding compensation to season ticket holders. I have also taken a look at your performance tables (I'm not able to paste the URL here), which I understand to be below target. Following this research, I spoke to your station staff about compensation for poor service, but was told to apply for it online. There was no way to do this online, so I got in touch with you, to which you responded by copying and pasting the uninformative terms from your website, and in doing so, ignoring my question.\nWere you a publicly-owned company, I would have understood your inability to work diligently, but your company is making an obscene\u00a0amount of money out of the tickets that people like me are buying, yet you take no responsibility for the poor service that you are providing by improving your resources. Your trains are late more often than they are on time, and when they do arrive the service is inadequate for the number of people using it. As you have the monopoly on the service, there is no incentive for you to be diligent, so you continue with your arrogant treatment of the people paying for your big fat shareholders' Christmas hampers.\nPlease, could you inform me how I might get compensation for your third-world service, and when you might improve the service to resemble that of at least that of a developing country's service? If you're not able to take pride in your work, please give it to someone who will.\nI look forward in hope to a response that isn't regurgitated from elsewhere.",

I myself by now had made other arrangements and asked my daughter to come from Saltash to collect me as I could not stand in the cold any longer waiting and stayed the night at her house. I left my fellow travellers at 8.35pm still waiting for a taxi. I do not think that GWR customer service could get any worse but I was wrong they do not understand the meaning of customer service as all we got told was its being dealt with no times or explanations were given. if I could give a minus score I would.",

Perhaps they are more interested in sending a simple copy and past reply to customers in a vague attempt to manage their bad PR. \n\nThe service they run is borderline criminal, and they continue to leech money out of customers who frankly are at the mercy to these  bandits. \n\nI feel sorry for the person who is scarcely paid the minimum wage to record these complaints, send them off to senior management before being instantly put into the bin.",

They also charged for the call.\nTrains are consistently late.\nPrices are totally inconsistent with each other - it feels like a bad lottery - how much will they rob me for today?\nTrains are often crowded.\nGWR ignores any customer interaction that does not involve or lead to the customer paying GWR.\nWrote this today because after paying through the nose for a return ticket I could barely afford, and getting through gates with no issue, the man checking tickets insisted I could not be on this train and I\u2019d have to change to a later one (the only difference being that with this new route I got in 15mins later and had to do far more changes). And I also got charged \u00a320 for it... if I did not pay they have systems in place to leech the money from me after - I only know because this was nearly the case as my card was declined.\nTotally evil.

I\u2019m sorry to hear you couldn\u2019t sit in the seat you reserved for your trip and that the member of staff you asked for help didn't meet your expectations.\nWe work hard to make sure all our customers get the seats they book, so it\u2019s disappointing we didn\u2019t manage that for you. I\u2019ve looked into what happened and provided some information for you below.\nUnfortunately as you were able to find an alternative seat during your journey, we are unable to provide any compensation for the price of your tickets.\nOur system for seat reservations is normally very efficient, but sometimes things don\u2019t always go to plan and our trains can get very crowded - which we can't always account for.\nWith regard to the member of staff you spoke to on the station plaftorm, I've recorded your complaint and it will be passed on to the manager of that station so that they can investigate and speak to the member of staff concerned.\nOnce we know exactly what happened and why, we\u2019ll take any necessary steps to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. This can range from giving the member of staff some extra training if they need it, to more serious consideration about whether or not they can do the job we want them to do.\nWe keep details of any disciplinary action confidential, but I hope this reassures you that we\u2019ll do everything we can to put this right for you.\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t manage to honour your booking and for your poor experience with our staff. I hope everything goes more smoothly next time you travel with us \u2013 and that you\u2019ll have a more enjoyable journey.\nYours sincerely\nMark\nCustomer Support Advisor",

Didn't advise that seat reservations were not in operation so hence everyone makes their way to their allocated seat to find its already been taken. It was supposed to be a 9 carriage train but was reduced to 5 carriages - so incredibly over crowded. Two of the remaining 5 carriages were first class (why is it that they manage to have enough carriages to cater for first class). So ended up with 3 carriages for standard class instead of the 7 expected. With most people booking in advance Great western railway know how many passengers they are expecting yet they can still reduce the service. The actions of the first great western staff caused extreme distress to some young travellers. Will not be travelling with Great Western Railway again.",

I have used this railway for the last 3 months commuting from charlbury to Paddington everyday. \nYes occasionally they decide to strip a train if 4 carriages at rush hour and have people sat in the aisles but mostly it\u2019s ok. Not great, but ok.\nI have the option of using chiltern into London from Bicester but I decided to use charlbury for easy access. \nNot any more!! I won\u2019t use this railway again. \nI spend \u00a3200 a week for my ticket on this railway and I want my money back. \nMonday. 15.50 train home. Cancelled.Broken down train. Tuesday 15.50 train cancelled. Broken down train. Then to make matters worse, after getting the 16.22 that got held up for 30 odd minutes near oxford. Guess why?? Broken down train on line ahead. Wednesday. 15.50. Wow, it\u2019s running. Great. No. Got stopped on the line for over 30 minutes behind freight train and then a slow moving train coming the other way. Now Thursday. 15.50 train. It\u2019s boarding. Great!! No no no, we are all sat on it awaiting departure  and all the lights go off. Train broken down. Cancelled. I am not even joking. Now I\u2019m sat on a overcrowded 16.22 on my way writing this because I\u2019m\nFuming. \nI will not be using them again. They\u2019ve lost between. \u00a3800 to \u00a31000 a month from me. \nIncredible. \nI want a full refund for this weeks ticket.  I probably won\u2019t get anything. (So a passenger sat next to me claims)) he\u2019s tried many times. \nIf you can find an alternate transport. Do it. If not, I would walk or thumb it.",

The timetable had our train come in on platform 1, however a train on platform 2 was already waiting. It wasn't until the platform 2 train left and we had finally managed to locate a member of staff in a station with almost no staff to be seen, we found out that our train on platform 1 was in fact on platform 2 and had just left.\n\nAnnoyed but willing to put half the blame on ourselves we proceeded to the ticket office where we were told they don't predict the platform until it arrives... which is not how it works anywhere else that we've been, and then she predicts to us that the next train we would need is platform 4...\n\nA train is already waiting but due to our disorientation from the last mixup we decided to ask some members of staff just to be safe.\n\nFor starters, the staff members where difficult to make out as staff members and we could only see one persons lanyard and another's jumper, there was nothing else to indicate they where staff. The 3 stood huddled, chatting and messing about like school children and looked almost disgruntled that I dared excused them as a customer not wishing to get confused.\n\nThey spoke bluntly and patronizingly that yes this is the train as I can see, and when I asked if the doors where closed because I should already be on it I was laughed at because \"you can't get on it now because the doors are closed\".\n\nYes, i can see the doors are closed, that wasn't my question. My question was \"should I already be getting on?\".\n\nI felt laughed at and ridiculed by fully grown adults acting like \"back of the bus\" school kids.\n\nThe pure level of unprofessionalism was enough to send our anxiety sky high and wouldn't expect to be spoken to like that by any \"adult\" let alone a group of adults in a professional position.",

The line (especially Reading / Paddington) is terrible on these new trains - literally every second of the journey you are jolted about, either left/right or up/down, as if there is no suspension at all. It is worse on seats near the doors as you get nearer the wheels. I cannot imagine what this is doing for my back. There are also some really worrying bangs and bumps from under the train some days. \nBy comparison I was on an intercity train in Spain a few weeks ago, the train was running at 155 mph and a really comfortable journey and not thrown about at all.  If Spain can do this, why cant we in the UK ?\nI suspect the entire line out of Paddington needs relaying but I doubt that will ever happen.",

Funny enough, they don't let me pay (587 pounds per month). Obviously I can get tickets at the station but that way there is no way to load Nectar card points, which is really annoying as GWR advertises this on their website. \n\nI wasted an hour trying to pay on their website yesterday and all they could say when I finally managed to contact them was: \"there has been a known issue on payments on our website, go to the station\" (and forget your Nectar points worth ~20 pounds). This sort of problems has happened every single time I tried to use their app or their website.\n\nThis would be fine... IF TICKETS WEREN'T SO EXPENSIVE! Nearly 600 pounds a month for an hour long train journey is insane... Especially when we should incentivise to get public transport!!!\n\nAND WHEN REPLYING TO THIS SAME REVIEW, THEY ADVISED ME TO CONTACT THEM VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH A) I DON'T USE FOR THESE PURPOSES AND B) SHOULD NOT BE THE CHANNEL TO SOLVE ISSUES. I WAS READY TO GIVE 3 STARS BUT I ACTUALLY DOWNGRADED TO 1.\n\nTOTAL DISASTER!",

We printed our pre-purchased tickets on arrival from the automated machine and hung around a bit...  As we were way too early we headed to the Beer House bar to grab a coke, all was well, or so we thought...\n\nThe TV monitor in the bar showed our train was delayed, not a whole lot but (as I recall) from 1603 to around 1610, then after a short while to around 1615....\n\nAt around 1600 we left the bar to head to the platform, this to be in continued good time and on account the platform was just around 20yds away, at this rate we were 15mins early...\n\nImagine our utter surprise when upon arriving at the platform just moments later the train was seen leaving.....\n\nWe checked pretty much instantly with the platform guy and he advised us the train was the \u201c1603\u201d and it\u2019d just left!\n\nUnsure what to do and querying the display boards that showed a delay we asked what we should do, the platform guy suggested we go to the information desk....\n\nWe headed there to be told they get problems time to time with telemetry and it could be the boards were wrong! \n\nThe guy at the desk then directed us to the ticketing office advising us we should be able to sort our tickets, \n\nYeah right!\n\nWhen we got to the ticket desk we received no assistance and were told we\u2019d have to buy secondary tickets at a cost of \u00a3148 (on top of the tickets already bought in good faith)... \n\nWith little choice in this matter we did this, \u2018guess we should count ourselves lucky as the next train was around 1630, just a short while later,\n\nWith just a little time to spare we returned to the information desk for a second time to see what the route to refund would be.  We were told all\u2019 be Ok we\u2019d just need to email GWR with the details and they\u2019d refund us....\n\nAs if!!!\n\nI sent all details to GWR including photos of the original tickets, the replacements and full details of the event...\n\nThey eventually replied to said they\u2019d pass on notes ref the incorrect boards but wouldn\u2019t refund the cost of our secondary tickets \u201cas we were required to have them for our secondary journey\u201d....\n\nGo figure???\n\nWe were also told some utter cock and bull story along the lines that we should allow time to get to the platform and also allow time between platform transfers...\n\nEh?????\n\nTHEIR INFO BOARDS WERE WRONG!!!!\n\nThey then had the indignity to add insult to injury and send secondary email asking for \u201chow\u2019d we do\u201d feedback...\n\nRUBBISH!!!\n\nLet the train take the strain? I don\u2019t think so...\n\n\u00a3148 on top of tickets already bought for the very same journey,\n\nTotally unethical and immoral treatment from GWR,\n\nIt\u2019ll be the car next time.\n\nUpdate....\n\nYou\u2019ll see below Brad\u2019s written a helpful reply, thanks Brad, only one thing..... where\u2019s my money????",

In fact there were no trains out of Port Talbot last night. There were no busses laid on.\nAs their phones had died they couldn't ring home to ask to be picked up so had no alternative but to to take a taxi the 25 miles at a further cost of \u00a345. They were stranded in the dark, what if they had no money on them? I dread to think. \nI rang company this am to be told they need receipt for taxi fare. How many 19 year olds are going to think of making a claim so getting a receipt from taxi driver? So an already expensive journey has turned out even more costly, in fact \u00a3130 and the match ticket was a meat \u00a315 each.\nAwful or rather non existent customer service and total disregard to customer safety. Oh just incase you are unaware, if you find yourself in a similar situation the company will arrange and pay a taxi for you if you give them a ring and ask.

This is utterly patronising and dishonest. The seats could not possible have been ergonomically designed or I would not be in pain now. I had to bundle up my jacket to get a bit of support in my lower back. He seems to be suggesting that it is my body that is at fault. Nothing to do with the penny pinching attitude of the company, and the idiocy that has resulted in an almost vertical seat back. I wonder how injured I'd have to be to sue the company?",

        "review_text": "They have always run a bad service but at least the old trains were comfortable. Now the services are composed of two separate trains joined together. It's hard to see which carriages have the available seats, so everyone now has to run along the platform with their heads ducked to look for the green lights above the seats (that's if the reservations haven't been switched off altogether in which case prepare for someone to ask you to move out of their seat). \n\nIf you do actually get a seat you may soon regret that choice; basically they are non existent, just some fabric over hard plastic. After two hours you notice you're not alone in squirming in your seat (I take a cushion now). The vestibules are also quite restricted compared to the old ones so not even the luxury of sitting on the floor if busy. Don't worry though, an announcement might tell you of room in a carriage in the other train and all you need do is get off at the next stop and hope you make it before the automatic doors close (suffice to say, no one takes up on this offer).The buffet is gone and so now you might be lucky to see a trolley on your journey but they are sporadic and can't run if the service is busy. Toilets are reduced and there is no more space for luggage then on the old trains, so still the usual bags in the aisles. \n\nStill amazes me that they berate you for using their busy services which are the first cheap ones in the evening out of London whilst the ones just before run with ample room. The chaos of the 19:03 from Paddington to Plymouth is all of their own making.",

I have been unable to book a seat for both legs of a journey to Cornwall for about a year now - I am a regular passenger in this route - and since the new trains have been introduced it has got worse. There is insufficient space for luggage, the loos are constantly out of order (doors jamming, no water for hand washing). And the regular cubicles are so tiny that even when in service there is no room to move and when there is water for hand washing the design of the sink means it splashes all over the tiny cubicle floor. I\u2019m about five foot tall so goodness only knows how anyone taller finds this part of the \u2018customer experience\u2019.  These are inherent and consistent problems and not just a one off. Today only five carriages between Penzance and Plymouth so standing room only at Liskeard. And all of this for just short of \u00a3300 pounds if travelling first class. A further five carriages joined at Plymouth (disembark and run for a seat people) but only one loo working on the train after Plymouth and no disabled loo despite a \u2018disabled facilities\u2019 coach.  Seats hard and uncomfortable with no head rest cushions on many. And no buffet car and passengers from standard without easy access to refreshments. (Btw - during the consultation no one was asked if they would prefer at the seat service if the trolley was unreliable and no other options were available). I observed a number of people including the elderly and infirm  knocking on the staff door to ask when the trolley would be coming through. Automated announcements with no regular updates about whether the train was running on time (important when planning to link to a branch line). General consensus from passengers was \u2018how can they get this so wrong\u2019.",

        "title": "Extremely GOOD assistance at Paddington, Swindon and Gloucester!!",
        "review_text": "we travelled from Paddington - Gloucester and return on Saturday 3rd out and Saturday 10th home. We booked using our \"Two Together\" annual rail card and thought each journey would be direct. We discovered, on arrival at Paddington on 3rd, that we would have to change at Swindon. I amsomewhat disbaled - walk with two elbow crutches - and thanks to the \"Assistance\" we received, we had help getting to our seats from Paddington - a wheelchair awaited me as we arrived at Swindon and I was taken speedily to the platform for Gloucester and we were seated in the \"wheelchair\" appropriate carriage. We were also met at Gloucester. The journey was thus a delight; simple and extremely courteously sorted. \nBefore we left Gloucester station I explained to the person at the gate that I would need assistance on the 10th ... the woman wasn't very helpful, told me that nothing could be done in site and gave me a card and a number to call.\nWe were going on the river Severn and didn't have a mobile - poor connections anyway - but I did phone thenumber at about 7.30am this morning, only to be told that they couldn't help \"on the day\"\nWell, we arrived at the station about 3 hours before our train was due and I spoke to the gentleman at the ticket counter. He not only sorted assistance but he was also able to get us on an earlier train. We still had to change at |Swindon but we had assistance getting on the train at Gloucester and a young manwas waiting as we alighted at Swindon and he actually waited with us and got us on the train and found us two seats with extra leg room. When we arrived at |Paddinton we were \"on our own\" BUT we were extremely pleased with the courtesy, assistance and help we received on both journeys - all the male BR personnel who we met were extremely helpful and we'd give them 100% PLUS!!! Pity about the somewhat officious young woman but we circumvented her anyway!!!\nSo MANY THANKS to Paddington, Swindon and Gloucester - we'll travel with confidence next time",

Train pulls into the station - couldn't see coach D. Asked the guard on the platform, he said there was no coach D! Myself and a lot of other customers asked what we were supposed to do, the guard said the reservations were not working. So, got on the train - every seat in the carriage was reserved and occupied! Eventually got a seat at the next stop when some passengers left the train. Then, to finish everything off, it was announced the refreshment trolley could not make its way through the train as it was so crowded (here's a tip GWR, try not cutting an entire carriage), and that the static trolley could be found between coach D (which, remember, doesn't exist) and coach E!",

        "review_text": "I was due to travel back to London from Bodmin  on the 12th July at 11:16 however when we arrived early at the train station we could see there were no seat reservations but no communication as to why. \nI found a member of staff with difficulty as it\u2019s not well staffed who informed me that the train service  had been reduced from a 10-5 carriages but may be ok as the last service was busy.\n\nI  am attempted to board the service but was unable to due to capacity. The train was already standing room only and plus plus luggage in the corridors. The train manager met me at the door and said I could try and squeeze on but recommended waiting for the next train. They also said there was no catering on the whole journey. I can\u2019t stand nor should I stand for a journey in which I have paid for a seat on. It would have made me unwell. \n\nI had to wait at Bodmin station as my parents had left thinking I was boarding the train until 12:10. I attempted to get a cup of tea from the cafe however this was also shut. I managed to board the 12:10 train and managed to get a seat. The catering service was very poor due to the changes the company has made to the trains. The trolley didn\u2019t get to us until Reading! I still ordered a tea as did many others as we were thirsty. This wasn\u2019t a once off. Needless to say on my journey down to Cornwall on the 8th the train was extremely busy with people standing and too much luggage so the trolley service couldn\u2019t even get down the carriages. I don\u2019t know who thought taking the catering carriage and luggage systems out just to fit more customers in was a good idea on a holiday destination and commuter train service. \n\nI completed a train delay repay form which was declined as there was no delay with my train and given what can only be seen as an automated response because her computer said no and didn\u2019t read the comments. I subsequently completed the appeal form thinking a human may read it and getting really annoyed at the process at this point to find it had been rejected again for the same reason.\n\nI have been travelling with GWR for years as I am from Cornwall but work in the NHS in London after university. There\u2019s always been problems not this illogical. It\u2019s always a busy service no matter what time of day or year and always issues with over crowding and lack of storage space but it\u2019s even worse and more inadequate now more than ever and then the cost has increased. I paid over \u00a3115 for a return. You can fly abroad in less time and better service for less. I don\u2019t get a lot of time off so need to saviour it and it puts me off going home knowing I\u2019m going to have a nightmare journey at least one way. The service needs to get better and focus on customer experience not increasing more seats and revenue.",

Rock hard seating, NO buffet car or trolley service from london to Plymouth, very poor luggage space, deafening engine noise which vibrates through the floor into the seats and vibrates your conkers off!!!\nsome cretin decided it was a good idea instead of having an engine at each end with near silent cabins to putting the engines underneath!!! I cannot travel on these ghastly trains and now having to fly to London which is incidentally cheaper by \u00a330!!! \nFirst class are rock hard too for double the price, gwr bring back our very comfortable HST trains!! \nIt's obvious that privatisation is built for profit in mind with nasty cheaply finished, uncomfortable trains and not a single thought for the poor unfortunate travelling public who pay extortionate ticket prices for this abysmal service, avoid GWR AT ALL COSTS!!!.",

        "title": "Long delays, packed trains, safety and failure of seat reservations.",
        "review_text": "I've just written a review concerning my Paddington to Saltash journey last Thursday (11th July at 19:03 ).This was 1hour 5 minutes late reaching Plymouth - too late for passengers to catch scheduled services into Cornwall so all were taxied by GWR to their destinations - adding to their delays - total 1 hour 25 minutes in my case. Curiously - and very worryingly - for a service company, GWR deny that there was any delay at all !\nHowever, in addition to this problem, due to the train's late arrival in Paddington, no reservation tickets were put on the seats,  such that the sprightly first boarders clustered round the information board at Paddington just grabbed any seat they could. Being 80 years of age I wasn't quick enough but in any case couldn't have reached my reserved seat since the train was packed to a point which should, by any yardstick, be considered unsafe. People were even sitting in the toilets - which rendered them unuseable for the purpose they were intended. I thought I might have been able to sit down after Reading but no such luck until later in the journey. There was, of course, no buffet bar since the late departure from Paddington  made this impossible.  The train manager was as helpful as he could be. He even went the length of the train taking a note of who was travelling onward into Cornwall. This was however of no avail. All onward passengers had to queue at the Waiting Room on Platform 4 , Plymouth Station, from where all were eventually allocated a taxi to their booked station .",

I had just completed the 100km Race to Stones and I was a broken lady....but the staff at Swindon station and on the train could not have been better.  The lady in the ticket office filled my water bottle for me, the platform guard said he would call me for my train (I had a 55 min wait) if I fell asleep.  Then a lovely onboard GWR employee a gentleman called Shanon (who got on at Swindon to start work - the 8:35pm to Paddington) carried my bags on for me, let me sit in the First Class carriage that was the carriage the pulled up closest to me as I could barely walk.  He got me a cup of tea and some biscuits and then phoned ahead to Reading to check if I could have some help with my transfer to the Guildford service.  The onboard guard (sorry I did not get his name) checked the times and platform for me, which mean I made my connection easily.  All round FANTASTIC service + the GWR train was clean and on time.",

We arrived back at Paddington the next day in good time in preparation for our return journey.  We were monitoring the display boards for the journey and noticed that it was saying 'cancelled' for this trip.  We then went to the information desk to enquire about options. The options offered were not viable as there was a significant change in timings and we had commitments at home. We were forced to board a train terminating before our destination and make our own arrangements from there.  This negative experience and inconvenience spoilt my birthday treat and it appears that it is entirely due to GWR's 6 day working contracts, which result in a lack of cover for Sunday services.  There were in fact two trains cancelled on the S Westerly route on that Sunday. This is not acceptable to customers and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency!! Customers are NOT impressed!",

Lee helped me from the beginning until the end, he went beyond to help me get my phone back and I am still so appreciate and grateful for his compassion, knowledge and patience. Thank you so much Lee, you made my stressful, and sad situation bearable. Did I mention I was alone in a foreign place with no phone, ahhhh. Thank you, thank you!!!",

I suppose it\u2019s not often that you get good feedback but I really want to say how helpful they were. I was travelling home from work and have had a very stressful day already, and had in my tiredness missed the stop at Liskeard and before I noticed the train was pulling away off to Plymouth. I honestly was going through a myriad of emotions and was pretty stressed and upset and went looking for someone on the train to see what my options were and to potentially buy another ticket back to Liskeard. Your staff members were very sympathetic and could see I was rather upset and stressed out and they very kindly allowed me a free ticket to travel back to Liskeard on the next service. Not only that but the kind lady gave me a complimentary drink voucher as well which was so unexpected and really made my day! Had I not received such great customer service I would have probably got more upset about the situation and worked up but they really calmed me down and assured me that it would all be ok. Thank you so much for the great service and I will be sure to always try and travel on your GWR services when I can! Thanks again! If I post a photo of the note perhaps you could locate the staff member and thank her for me personally again as she really represented your organisation in a really great way, and outdid herself in the situation!",

So know Brad i won't be taking you up on that offer i have more chance of winning the lottery (and i don't do it) than trusting you to get me to my connection in fact i challenge you now if you are up to it my train for Stafford leaves Cheltenham at 13.41 now you get me from Stonehouse in gloucestershire to there from Stonehouse avoiding all paddington trains without me having to wait at Cheltenham half the day and remember this is a sunday, \"waiting with baited breath for your reply\"",

        "review_text": "I tried The Night Riviera for the first time (at Penzance) with high hopes and great expectations, having tried the Caledonian Sleeper previously.\n\nSafe to say, it was, as the title of the review states, a night to remember. The member of staff at the Penzance lounge was friendly and welcoming and the lounge itself was comfortable and stocked up with plenty snacks and drinks. Boarding was simple enough and a member of staff showed me to my room and took my order for breakfast. The lounge car was a nice place to be too and the staff member at the bar was very friendly. As for the cabin itself, it may be small but its very nice and I did manage a good few hours of sleep.\n\nHaving dozed off somewhere around Truro, I woke up in Reading feeling well-rested. Breakfast was presented to me at the time I requested. The train arrived into London Paddington on time. As per the rules for guests travelling Penzance to London, passengers can stay on the train until 6:45am even though the train arrives into London at 5am. I stuck around until 6am and used the first class lounge. Again, friendly staff and well stocked up with snacks and drinks.\n\nAll in all, I'd happily vouch for the Night Riviera as one of those things you have to do in your lifetime at least once. I couldn't recommend it enough.\n\nMany thanks GWR! :)",

In the old trains the power point was in front of you so you could see where to plug in.\n\nIt takes guess-work alone to get something into the socket - unless you have bendy eyes like a snail they cannot be seen.  Someone should have tried these out before installing seats with such inconvenient power sockets.\n\nI find the new trains more comfortable than the old ones overall.\n\nAnother observation is that in the micro-toilets, the water squirter over the sink spills into the floor.\n\nPlease move the power sockets - many thanks, Bill.",

The return journey was even worse. There was meant to be a service at 7.30 pm to Bristol Temple Meads but hey ho this had been cancelled, with no other information given.Reluctantly we joined another 3 carriage train to Taunton which was absolutely packed,crushed standing room only so we stood all the way.Not sure the air con was working properly and one young boy felt faint but as we arrived at Temple Meads  message was given Could passengers look and see if anyone was struggling with the conditions and offer them a seat.This as we got off after standing for 45 minutes +.The final blow was finding out that the 7.30 train from Cardiff which we could have got all the way to Bath was not in fact cancelled but instead started at Newport,one stop down the line.Why were people not told this.Honestly this is no way to run a service,you should be ashamed of the way the public are treated.",

        "review_text": "I left a review earlier about the poor state of First Class on GWR, only to be hit with more misery on another trip. My earlier review talked about GWR not delivering a premium service for the hugely high (frankly ridiculous) prices they charge for First Class. Unfortunately, those problems also extend to the staff, who seem woefully ill trained to deliver the premium service their customers are paying for. An example is my last trip. On a long route between Penzance and London I asked for a second sandwich late in the trip. I was rudely told that I had already had a sandwich earlier and would have to pay for a second one, despite having a full fare First Class ticket! I have no idea is that's correct company practice. But what I do know is that (1) I have had to spend over \u00a35k commuting from London down to Cornwall in First Class over the past three months for a work project and this has NEVER happened before on any of those trips (ie you have always been able to have more than one sandwich) and (2) if it is the company's rule then they should be ashamed of themselves (considering the cost of the First Class tickets and the measly nature of the sandwiches on offer). Anyway, to make the matter worse the rude woman serving me first slammed down a sandwich on my table and then 'confronted' me for allegedly taking a picture of her! The fact was that I had not done anything of the sort. I was simply reading the news on my phone! But she was clearly paranoid that I was perhaps going to complain about her attitude and had taken a photo to identify her. That fear had also changed her mind about giving me another sandwich! What a joke! But all this stuff is just symptomatic of what's going wrong with the service in the so-called GWR First Class.",

Cannot find fault, OK, maybe they shouldn't serve Welsh water !!!!! Also happens to run along some of the most exceptional scenic track in the UK so there's yet another bonus.

Train staff are unsympathetic and for the most part less than willing to help with questions or queries.

However it does seem  that certain factors haven\u2019t been fully addressed. I travel fairly regularly on the Penzance/Paddington line. I realise some days and certain times are likely to be very busy. This was the case with the older trains and the same now despite the extra carriage. People frequently have to travel standing in very cramped spaces. Provision for luggage on a \u2018long haul\u2019 train journey are woefully inadequate . It is all very well to ask that luggage is not allowed to block the aisles- impossible to avoid. And WHY no buffet car in these trains. Because of the overcrowding the trolley is frequently unable to get down the train. Queues of frustrated thirsty passengers cause further congestion and irritation. It would be good to have advance warning as most people only discover this lack of a facility once on the train.\nIs all this the result of a company wishing to make as much money as possible while not ensuring passenger comfort and satisfaction?\nAnd yes - I did have a seat, which I booked and reserved in advance,and travelled  in relative comfort though I was very thirsty by time of arrival.",

Bhavik also helped with the bags and got us two great seats. A simply FANTASTIC experience! Thank you, Bhavik! #GWRftw",

Their letter contained no email or phone no and returned the whole application rather than keeping at their end.\nAfter contacting them, I was told they needed a copy of the user manual (this happened the first time and I found it in seconds online!) - apparently they don't keep records for more than 12 months and it seems to be beyond their skill set, to look online for user manuals or keep a log of which scooters are suitable, or have previously been issued. Bearing in mind, most people using assisted travel are elderly and disabled and probably don't have access to the internet or can use a computer.\n\nI then returned the application again with a copy of the user manual (26 pages) printed out on 3rd May to the freepost address.  Since then, I have been trying to find out if it has been received and that they now have everything needed to issue the permit but all I get told, despite raising an official complaint is that it takes 28 days to process!!!  My parents travel in less than 3 weeks and are now very stressed out as I am!!!  \n\nI cannot believe that an organisation of this size, cannot give me a straight answer and make their procedure SO unuser friendly for disabled and elderly passengers.  Appalling!!!",

I cannot thank you both enough for helping me, I truly appreciate it and I hope you both know that!\n\nThere are honestly no bad words to say about them and certainly have made me a much happier customer knowing that someone is there if ever in doubt, have a question or experiencing difficulty with a train ticket or any other queries. I always urge you to contact them if you need any help, they really will go above & beyond. \n\nThank you again, and thank you GWR for employing such lovely staff.",

No quiet carriage in reality, so passengers who book it on purpose for no phone pinging and loud calls are left to tell others who don't know or care that it's the quiet carriage (and risk getting told to eff off because the train manager is ALWAYS to nervous to tell anyone) because the signage is a measly tiny poster on the wall at the back. The buffet trolley is rubbish, the seats are miserable and the whole design inside is bleak and soulless.

The so-called quiet carriage is very inconspicuous with signs placed high and hard to read - so peace and quiet on the trains is now a thing of the past. \n\nReturned later in the day in First Clas - what a waste of money. Gone are the nice comfy seats, replaced with hard ones with equally hard backs. Even worse in the appalling lack of legroom. Again, which GWR management approved such seats and legroom? Truly dreadful. We will travel in standard class in future. \n\nAs for the GWR website - useless and put to shame by the one at Trainline which we always use even though it costs more.",

Our return journey, which was very stressful because our son fell ill was alleviated  because your staff throughout our journey from Cardiff were very supportive and caring.  Your bus replacement drivers were very sympathetic and helpful by calling a first aider and allowing us to wait on the bus. The first aider, Mr Kieran Tatterton at Bristol Parkway was extremely helpful. Seeing how weak our son was, he went out of his way to make him comfortable, gave him water etc. He's an indispensable GWR employee who deserves a promotion and pay rise. Overall, it was a great positive experience and a display of human kindness. We recommend GWR wholeheartedly!",

The trolley service is unable to cope. It did not arrive at my seat until I had been on the train for 3 hours, and it had run out of hot water!!!! Hence I was not able to have a hot drink during my 4 hour journey. It is an appalling service that GWR is providing. One staff member said that the buffet car had been replaced by the trolley service following a passenger survey which revealed people would prefer to be served at their seats. It is like Brexit - people are voting for things without thinking through the practical implications, and then bosses simply try to meet their requests even though it is OBVIOUS that it is impractical to do so. How does GWR imagine they can run a trolley service when the Penzance trains are often packed and people and luggage are occupying the aisles!!! What a waste of [our] money for the new trains that I understand are now going to have to be altered.",

        "review_text": "WoW! What a difference a train makes!\n\n\nOutward journey Penzance - Reading on Saturday. So called \"old train\". \n\nA fantastic experience, as usual. Great communication at every station to welcome customers aboard and information on the train and Buffet car. Delicious hot breakfast and lunch from selection of food and drinks.) Comfy seats and clean toilets.\n\nGreat Service. \n\n\nReturn journey Reading - Penzance on Monday. \n\n\nWhat can I say......!!!!\n\n\nThere was no communication at all that I was aware of. \n\n\nNothing to outline the overhead \"traffic light\" system of seat reservations so passengers, without a reservation, were continually being asked to move, having sat in a \"green light\" / non-booked seat on boarding that had turned into \"a red light\"/booked seat somewhere down the line.\n\n\nSince there was no communication, it was assumed there was a buffet car by others and myself. A long walk up the train with a fellow passenger involved navigating suitcases everywhere because there was nowhere to stow them. The search for the elusive Buffet car ended in the First Class section with a closed door.\n\n\nA Passenger in First Class informed me that \"this was 'a new train' as opposed to 'an old train' therefore had a trolley service, etc, etc, etc.\" I asked \"How are you meant to know?\" ...........!\n\n\nAs it turned out, the trolley service simply cannot and could not navigate all the suitcases (see above) blocking the carriages.  \n\n\nAnd, as it turned out, on a second journey up the train, this time in search of a trolley service that obviously couldn't get anywhere, I discovered from the First Class passenger (see above) that her name was Jane Jones, GWR Head of Public Affairs,\n\non presentation of her business card.\n\n\nI appreciate that Ms. Jones did accompany me back to Coach A from First Class to try and address the issues with us and try and defend GWR by way of an apology. But sadly apologies do not change facts or the design of the train.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note from an article from \u201cCornwall Live\u201d that:\n\n\n\"Passengers can expect more seats, more frequent services, better on-board facilities and shorter journey times, saving as much as 14 minutes between Paddington and Penzance.\n\n(*Better on-board facilities\". Experience appears to say something very different.)\n\n\nThe luggage racks are very different from the existing HST trains. They are narrower, but with more space above. Hitachi insists that they can take full-size luggage.*\n\n\n(*It depends on how you define \"full-size luggage\". My small rucksack just fitted in the luggage rack)\n\n\nThere is no buffet car, instead trolleys will deliver food and drink to passengers.\n\n(*An impossible task)\n\n\nThe Pullman service will continue, with meals served in first class.\n\n(*Yep)\n\n\nToilets are spacious, with baby changing facilities.\"\n\n\nYes, they are spacious....huge, in fact. \n\nBut at what cost? Luggage Storage Space. (See above).\n\n\nI also witnessed two young girls get locked into the toilet; with one becoming hysterical. The train driver came and rescued them; One older person who hadn't got a clue which buttons/ lever to press to close and lock the door; and one young man who didn't or couldn't lock the door and so the door swung open at a rather inopportune moment. \n\n\nFinally, everyone wearing the green uniform of GWR seem to me to be great ambassadors for the company in terms of doing their very best and a great job, against all the odds. It is certainly not their fault and yet, they seem to be the ones getting all the flack from customers who deserve a lot better from GWR. \n\n\nWe all do.",

        "title": "Awful New Trains",
        "review_text": "I travelled first class between Penzance and Exeter today for the first time on the GWR new green 800 trains. I was looking forward to something really special considering the age of the HSTs but I've never been so dissipointed with a train in 45 years of train travel. \n\nGone are the luxurious and comfortable leather seats to be replaced by cloth seats that are rook hard uncomfortable. I actually got back pain sitting in these seats after only 30 minutes and was really stiff and achy when I finally got off at Exeter after 3 hours. Thank god I wasn't travling to Paddington. These seats are quite frankly awful, the worst in the rail industry in my opinion and I'm a seasoned rail commuter. \n\nThese trains are noisy, they vibrate and sway during the journey and the suspension is really rough. Theres no buffet car anymore and no hot food. In first class there's just a trolly serving drinks, biscuits and cake. The paid trolley has more but it is nothing like the buffet car they replace. First class used to be lovely on this service but now it really isn't worth the extra cost. \n\nThere are charging sockets at each seat which is useful but they are difficult to use by the seat. The tables are wider and they is a little more room but it makes no difference when the rest of the seat is so uncomfortable. \n\nThe HSTs were old but so much better than these new trains. What were GWR thinking when they developed these trains. Certainly not customer comfort that's for sure. I'm honestly not making this up. These trains are just aweful. They have turned one of the best journeys I made on the rail network from the best to the worst. A lot of people were making the same comments on my journey. I want to see these services improve tourism in Cornwall but sadly I'm afraid they will have the adverse affect. \n\nMy comments are in no way directed towards the GWR staff on these services who are exemplary in every respect and could not be more helpful.",

        "review_text": "We recently returned from a long journey home from Australia so paid to travel first class from London to Exeter with GWR thinking it would be more pleasant. However a couple boarded at Westbury, when asked for their tickets they said they had standard tickets and had boarded first class by mistake. The conductor asked them to leave at the next station. They did not move, even though the ticket conductor was standing right next to their seat he did not 'remind' them to move and left them to travel all the way to Exeter! To top this they were loud and disruptive. Not what we wanted when trying to relax.\nWhen I complained we were told that it is not the conductors job to remove them or fine them. They said it could be more disruptive if they were told to move again so are allowed to remain!!\nWhat about fare evasion, fines for having the wrong ticket? They clearly done this on purpose and had no intention of moving. Why should we pay extra in future for first class tickets when we are now aware that we cannot be made to move.\nNo wonder fare prices continue to increase. What is the point of a ticket inspector. We may as well all travel with the cheapest ticket and sit where we like!",

In summary, this complaint was that they had charged me twice for the same seat. \nThe second is ongoing but customers should know that:\na) if you sit in first class (like I did for my wife's birthday) you aren't guaranteed any food or drink whatsoever. The bits they put up on the website mislead you into believing that it is part of the service. It is not, according to GWR themselves. This does of course beg the question as to why food and drink is advertised at all. \nb) Do not accept promises for recovering any costs you may have incurred by train staff as the customer service centre will not honour any such promises.",

My last few trips have honestly just been such a terrible experience, it feels disappointing that my trips have to start and end with GWR as the stress associated with their transport is too frequent.

I will opt for a comfortable journey and travel according to which company is providing my travel! If a man designed these seats he should be sacked for his lack of customer service to women and not for just long legged men!!!  I will not use your trains ever again.

He left me on the floor next to the disabled toilet. On departure I noticed the disabled toilet was out of order and requested on twitter a member of staff help me to get to a toilet. The train was full and standing. No member of staff turned up and no trolley service appeared as id ask him to get help.\nSadly I wet myself badly and despite many requests on twitter no help was offered.\nThe train was booked to terminate pt Talbot for bus replacement to Swansea.\nAs my pi$$ stain was obvious and the smell I decided to request a member of family meet me at Cardiff with a towel and change of clothes so I could leave train at Cardiff use  public toilet to change and wash and be driven home from Cardiff.\nI contacted GWR, by phone the next day and the only response was no compensation for overcrowded trains. They were not interested about my disabilities and could not care at all. Ive attached pix of trip and am a bit embaressed to add pics of my pi$$ stains. A complete failure of GWR disabled peoples protection policy.\nI had to lie on the floor from pad to Cardiff and helped off the train by family who met me on the platform.\nI spoke to customer services again and was told they are not interested",

The train was of course late but only about 15 minutes...A new train but no buffet car and no trolley service.  Inexcusable- and no apologies. The seats are butt-numbing - cattle class. I have to travel to London frequently from Bristol and complaining about the GWR service is now simply part of the journey, like buying an over-priced ticket.  To quote another post: \u2018the seat 'cushion' has little or no padding and the seat back is at a right angle with no recline so it is virtually impossible to relax. I honestly cannot remember having to sit in such an uncomfortable seat on any form of public transport. Everything already looks and feels worn and cheap. GWR has has stripped out all the good bits from their product in the naked pursuit of profit. All rather sad given how wonderful train travel to the West Country used to be in the days when service and quality counted for something. Those days are well and truly over it seems\u2019\nNot if we all keep complaining ...",

        "review_text": "My usual use of GWR is to commute between Cheltenham and Gloucester, but most of the time I go the whole way by bike. The train takes 10 minutes and saves a bit of time or trouble when the weather is terrible, and cyclists don't need to reserve a spot for the short trip.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, when I had planned a train commute, they announced the next one was running nearly 30 minutes late, so clearly, it made no sense waiting when I could set off directly by bike. I asked the next time if I could simply use my unused ticket from the delayed fare, and the answer was no. They explained I needed to request compensation and buy a new ticket, which I duly did.\nI photographed my unused ticket from the delay, emailed it to GWR and waited, only to learn they claim to categorically reject any compensation request for less than 60 minutes delay. Since my ticket was completely worthless to me for that trip, I was doubly frustrated by also having wasted the time contacting them.\n\nIn conclusion, the bus is likely more reliable and costs slightly less, so I will lean towards that option next time I need a motorised way to work. GWR clearly doesn't stand behind its service for commuters.",

Obviously compensation for \nthis frankly pathetic service hasn't been reflected ina freezing of ticket prices, with above inflation rises still happening annually. The lack of accountability of these companies means they are not incentivized to improve the service, given they have a pretty much captive market.",

I would have to buy a new one and they would refund the price of the old one (which of course they had already collected the payment for off my card).  Needless to say, the refund never came through.  I have spent ages speaking to \"Customer Services\" who are not able to help, but refer me to other parts of the organisation, including Web Support - who of course are not authorised to make refunds.\nBottom line: you may be forced to travel with these cowboys, but do not under any circumstances buy your tickets online from GWR - use Virgin or any other operator's website instead.",

Sadly Virgin Trains have the monopoly so I have book with them unless I want to spend 12 hrs on a coach which I am actually considering.",

If there are delays which happens more than 50% of the time I often have to wait more than an hour and a half for a service in freezing conditions. Although independent most coffee shops close well before 8pm. Making this a long, cold, miserable journey day in and day out. I wrote of my experiences to GWR who then took a fortnight to respond with a very long sugar coated feedback explaining this and that etc without really addressing any of the issues or solving them. In addition to this when trains are repeatedly deplorably late ticket collectors with warm smug faces continue to move through the train checking tickets. This is just unacceptable. I have honoured my contract by purchasing a ticket for my journey, GWR it's time you honoured your part of the contract by providing a service. Not doing so is equal to theft. I can not stand this situation any longer and thankfully I shall move house in 2019 to be nearer to Exeter where I will no longer need to use the train anymore. A local bus will take me to and from work. I really have had enough.",

WiFi doesn\u2019t work, the toilets are absolutely tiny!!\n\nQuickly learned, adding to the hell of it that there is no buffet cart any more, just a trolley with noting on it.  No breakfast items at all.  Low stock of other things and as usual, extortionately priced!!

        "review_text": "Here I am again to share my latest jaw-dropping GWR horror story.\n\nRemember back in September when one of their new trains trashed the power lines and consequently wrote off the Paddington service for a day? Well I was one of the thousands of poor sods that day consequently unable to make it to London. So I needed to claim a refund on my \u00a392.00 off-peak ticket and travelcard. (that's right, nearly \u00a3100 to go less than 100 miles on public transport). \n\nYou'll be unsuprised to hear that claiming a refund from GWR is a bit of an obstacle course. First you have to find what type of screw-up you are claiming for and whether you are eligible for your money back. Once you're through that it's on to the claim itself. First an online form is required to be completed which is sent to their refunds department. The same form then needs to be printed out and, along with the original tickets (not copies) and a separate form displaying the claim reference, the whole lot posted to a freepost address. I dutifully carried out this astonishing Kafkaesque ritual and waited...\n\nAnd waited...\n\nAnd waited...\n\n(be patient, they must have had thousands of claims to process from that appalling day...)\n\nAnd waited...\n\nUntil finally, today an email arrived. I read it and this is what it said:\n\nDear Mr XXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nRE : Your booking reference XXXXXXX\n\nThank you for contacting Great Western Railway requesting a refund on your journey tickets.\n\nIn order to process a refund it is a condition of UK rail retailing rules that the original tickets must be returned to us within 28 days of the planned travel date.\n\nUnfortunately we are not able to process your refund request as we have not received your original tickets. Please note that \u2018scanned\u2019 tickets or ticket images are not considered to be the original ticket and therefore a refund will not be processed on these.\n\nKind regards\n\nGWR Refund Team\n\nI am literally running out of coping strategies to deal with this.",

The coach had a QUIET COACH notice, a man started to berate the poor mother and another woman in turn had a furious confrontation with the man.  I am 80 and had no problem with the child crying.\n\nI emailed GWR and received a reply over a week later (website claims to answer emails from disabled passengers within 24 hours) denying this was a quiet coach and not commenting about the carriage being at the end of the train and asking me for proof of my journey.  I sent my GWR referenced Disabled Booking reservation but this cut no ice and three emails and over a month later I can do no more as I don\u2019t have the tickets or ticket reference number but I di provide proof of my journey on that date.\n\nI can understand the terrible rating that GWR has received on Trust Pilot and wish that one could give a minus star",

It took me 3 months to get a refund.\nThe new Hitachi trains running on this service are terrible too. The seats are like sitting on wood. There's no cushioning to speak of which at the end of a 2 hour+ journey really takes its toll.\nThen there's the price. Even on off-peak pricing it's slightly cheaper to drive and pay London parking rates, which is what I'll now start doing.",

        "review_text": "I use the Nailsea to Paddington route on a fairly regular basis using Trainline to book my advance tickets. In the past this has been a very good service but having used this process recently it has turned into a nightmare! GWR has recently started using the new Hitachi trains which has turned the booking process into an absolute joke!!! Part of the booking online allows you to choose forward facing, quiet carriage, table seat, etc., but either GWR have not cottoned on to the fact that the seating profile is completely different to the old trains or they just could not give a damn about customers using their so called \"service\". Briefly, when we boarded the train from Bristol we found that the \"reserved seats were not forward facing,did not have a table,etc., A very helpful GWR lady did tell us to change to any forward facing seats that had a green light above them which, because the train was pretty quiet, we were able to do. However, on our return from Paddington several days later the train was very busy and our \"reserved seats\" had been taken up. As there were no reserved labels attached to the seats despite telling the people in them they were our seats they refused to move. This must happen on a very regular basis and I can imagine tempers get frayed. Eventually,we were very fortunate to get some seats but only after some time searching. We were in the last carriage on a 9 coach train and when the inspector came round he told us we would have to walk virtually the whole length of the train to get off at Nailsea which could only accommodate the front four carriages. With two suitcases that was not an easy task for two elderly passengers. With regard to previous posts concerning the seats I must admit that for someone with an ongoing back problem I found the firmness of the seating was, in fact, good for my posture and had not problem with them although they do, admitedley have little padding. In conclusion, if you are travelling on this route with the new Hitachi carriages don't bother requesting the options advertised as you will be very disappointed as they don't exist unless you are lucky enough to get on an old train. Do GWR advertise this fact? Of course they don't you are just left to get on with it and continue paying their exhorbitant fares for a vastly inferior service.",

Also when I went to use the toilet a lady had come out to tell me it was disgusting and advised me not to go in. I had to walk down a few carriages to find another one I could use.  Coming back the following week our train left Penzance at 4pm ;sceduled to arrive at 9pm.  It was around 10.30 it arrived.   Also the carriage we were in was absolutly cold. Yet walking through the other carriages it was lovely and warm.  Not a great trip either way. I think they need to get their act together. Absolute disgrace.",

Showing a letter from hospital confirming my appointment ran late, he wrote me a note allowing me to use the peak 545 service to Swansea at no additional charge. \n\nAnother time a few months ago; I was left in a wheelchair due to an operation going wrong, there was limited space for wheelchair due to change of train so GWR upgraded me and my mother to first class. \n\nMY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT AS OF LATE THE SEAT RESERVATIONS, NEVER SEEM TO BE APPLIED, as a disabled customer I\u2019m unable to stand for the long jounrey so vital that I get a seat, my cardiac disability isn\u2019t visible so people don\u2019t automatically give up their seats for me. There isn\u2019t often any Trajn staff present on packed trains to help you get customers in priority seats to move, which is why I have given 4 stars not 5.",

The ride is bumpy, even rocky and you really feel the vibration from the rails coming through to the car. The seat reservation was chaotic....I sat in a seat with no reservation card in the back of the seat, so I assumed the seat was not reserved, I've traveled with GWR long enough now to know this is standard, on 2 separate occasions I had to move because the seats were reserved, but how would you possibly know this if the reservation card wasn't in the back of the seat, absolutely useless - customers were also having to stand.  I despair of GWR, they are a shocking company with very little to be proud of, but still they choose to be totally oblivious of customers complaints/concerns, seem to treat customer with contempt and just carry on as if everything is hunky dory, wake up, it's not okay and far from okay.............it's no less than a bad kind of arrogance.",

I was promised half my fair \u00a3120 and a \u00a350 voucher, which I have never received. It's now August 2018 and I am still trying to get this cash back.

When it does turn up it is already full and you are forced to stand in hot cramped conditions and the best thing is that they expect you to pay them for being treated like a prisoner.\n\nI suggest this is not fit for purpose and until things are working properly they should offer free rail travel but of course this won\u2019t happen and the bare faced cheeky sods will put prices up again next year.",

        "review_text": "Last month I travelled from London Paddington to Bodmin Parkway (11th July 12:30 train) and given the length of the journey I decided to buy a first class ticket to make the journey more comfortable (possibly the first time I\u2019ve bought a first class ticket).\n\nWhen we boarded the train we were told by the onboard staff that despite having reserved seats the company hadn\u2019t attached enough carriages and so we would have to stand (I had a non reserved seat, but there were plenty in the carriage arguing over the same \u2018reserved\u2019 seat). As the train pulled into Reading and Didcott more passengers got on which only increased the overcrowding.\n\nThe staff on the carriage were professional, friendly and very apolgetic for the situation (one lady who got on at Reading and worked for GWR head office, tried her best to make sure everyone was as comfortable as possible with food and drinks). The train Manager provided us with a code on our ticket and told us to send a picture into GWR for a full refund, which I felt I deserved after standing for four hours with a first class ticket.\n\nAnyway to cut a long story short, a MONTH later (apparently they are experiencing a high number of \u2018enquiries\u2019) I\u2019ve just heard back from GWR to say that they don\u2019t normally give refunds for \u2018overcrowding\u2019 but are prepared to give me 50% of a standard ticket coming to \u00a325. My guess is they knew it would be cheaper to pay out on ticket refunds (or not as it transpires) than to attach the correct number of carriages to this train - this is their business model. \n\nI wasn\u2019t actually too \u2018put out\u2019 by the situation on the day, but their follow up to it has been so poor I thought I would break the habit of a lifetime and write a review. Except for the train crew, VERY POOR all round!",

        "review_text": "The GWR web site is very often difficult to use, to navigate and frequently crashes despite repeated updates and modifications to the site. The trains are almost invariably late and frequently very overcrowded at peak times. Often one will often find that a promised 10 coach \"new\" train has been reduced to five coaches without explanation leading to passengers being dangerously rammed. The toilets are very often filthy or blocked. It is unusual for the taps to provide water to wash one's hands with in the old rolling stock which still plies the line. \n\nTrains are too often cancelled due to a shortage of drivers who plainly feel \u00a360,000 per annum is poor reward for working for GWR. The staff, to their credit, are almost always apologetic for the appalling service offered daily. And yet the fares continue to soar. The service offered by the rail network in general is an insult but what GWR offer is a travesty of a service. What is so sad is that the service gets worse with each passing year despite the surely handsome dividends passed on to shareholders. Passengers simply feel exploited and robbed.",

        "review_text": "Inefficient and incompetent at dealing with problems. My normal 90 minute journey to Oxford from Worcester took over four hours! Signals failures meant a shuttlebus from Worcester to Evesham; this took well over 90 minutes to appear and initially went to the wrong station!! Passengers were dumped at Evesham, with the promise of a train there, only to find we were stranded. The 12.26 and 14.25 trains to Oxford/Paddington both cancelled. The toilets were locked. One man struggled to cope with a barrage of complaints from passengers travelling both north and south. Eventually a train arrived. Instead of reaching Oxford at about 11.30, I got to my destination shortly before 3 o'clock.\nHorror of horrors! On the return journey, after passengers piled onto the 18.17 train at Oxford, we were told to all get off again and catch the already packed 18.50 to Worcester as there was \"a problem with the driver\"!!!! Passengers wanting to travel on to Hereford were told they couldn't. This train terminated at Worcester.\nWhat IS the problem with this rubbish rail company that they can't run a reliable service? The sad thing is that these delays and failure to resolve them quickly are regular occurrences on this line. Many passengers just seem resigned to them now.\" It's normal.\" Well, it's not. It's a travesty of a service.",

        "review_text": "Travelled to London on the 29/6/18 for an overnight break. Was due to return on the 30.6.18 on the  4:12 from Paddington to Cardiff however because of your poorly trained and abusive staff I missed the train. The saga began with the platform being announced and on the departures board, where there was a massive surge of people running for the train and staff hurrying people along, I guess as it had gone 4:12 they were up against it and wanted the train out ASAP. My ticket would not go through the machine, I went to the male staff member on the gates, his badge said Stephen. He told me I did not have the correct ticket ?? and brushed me aside, I was panic stricken, my friends were already through and he would not help me. A female staff member looked at my ticket and let me through stating the ticket was fine?? However they would not let me on the train and it left. I was shocked and distraught. Stephen was laughing and mocking me as I returned to the gates. I did not think he was professional and told him so. The female staff member said I could get the next train. I asked for his name and he went ballistic, shouting at me and came through the gate right in my face shouting\" Stephen\" . I felt very intimidated and scared of him. He was very aggressive towards me. I left the area as he continued to shout at me and then justifying himself to the female staff member who was very quiet and stood with her head down. Very unhelpful situation, he needs training in how to deal with CUSTOMERS.. if he is on the frontline of your service you have a big problem. Stephen is lucky I made it home on time to be able to top up my insulin or he would have been looking at far worse charges. Out of principal the  next time I intend to travel I will use a bus company and factor in the time difference as part of my trip. Disgusting way to be treated when I paid enough for a service that I did not get. SHAMEFUL. BTW - your air conditioning is poor and staff announcements are a waste of time as they can't be heard.... I had to ask what the announcement was about  and was told that if I wanted refreshment I needed to get off the train at the next stop and go to the first 5 cars where there was refreshment trolley ????  Was it because \"the trolley\" doesn't fit throughout your trains or that they just couldn't be bothered to come through the cars???  again a poor service on what looked to me to be a relatively new train. LAUGHABLE.",

Arrived in Cardiff over an hour after expected time and missed half the show. Ever thought of putting extra trains on for a big gig rather than fewer?\nReturn journey was completely cancelled, although no notifications sent so we didn't know till at the station. Fortunately we had arrived half an hour early to the station, so managed to get a GWR posh train for one stop ( It'll be great when you get those seats finished) then directed to bus for Bristol Templemeads. Which went to Bristol Parkway. Further train to Templemeads then a long wait for the train home. Late again.\nPassengers helped the two older ladies whose husbands were waiting for them somewhere the train wasn't now going and the lady on sticks whose carefully planned one train journey was now two trains and bus and all those stairs.\nAnd of course, no recompense as we don't live in London.

Utter rubbish service on every level. Not the first time our journey has been messed up by GWR either...Christmas  was ridiculous too.

This comes without warning or public consultation, and is completely unacceptable. Scores of customers from stations between Dorking Deepdene and Guildford will not be able to get to work on time. How can this be? The first train from Chilworth is now at 08.03, no good to anybody.\nFurthermore train staff have not been briefed on the changes, nobody in authority was available this morning to advise confused passengers\nI will be writing to the parish council and my MP, this disgraceful decision needs to be reversed.",

I put in a request for a delay repay 1-2 days later for being over 3hours delayed. \n\nThe 13th October was the first time I heard back from GWR about my request for a delay repay, I was made aware that \u2018I regret that a technical issue meant that your claim form was held by our spam filter, which has delayed our reply. This has now been resolved, however, I am sorry for the additional frustration this has no doubt caused.\u2019 and \u2018I can confirm your claim has now been processed and a payment of \u00a340.00 has been issued in the form of cheque. This includes an additional \u00a310.00 in recognition of the delay in processing you claim. You will receive this cheque within 2 weeks\u2019. \n\nHaving already waited 5 month to hear from GWR, to date I am STILL waiting for my repayment. I have been on the phone 8/9 times to GWR to revolve this and have been told over and over the same thing. I have been asked to confirm my email address and house address several times when called and have been told the delay was due to you needing a confirmation of postal address. This has NOT changed in the last 10 month and I have confirmed this EVERYTIME I have called. \n\nI think to customer service is awful and the lack of commutation in the department is discussing. Every time I have called I have spent 30-60minutes on the phone trying to resolve this and quite frankly I now do not think \u00a310 is \u2018recognition\u2019 enough for the delay in processing this claim and the time I have spent on the phone. \n\nI now have 4 different reference number due to the inefficient\u00a0system at GWR. I cannot stress enough my frustration with you as a company, From this experience I will try to avoid GWR at all costs.",

        "review_text": "Just like everyone else I am only leaving one star because there is no option for zero. \n\nI travel every week for work, Mon - Fri. The way the season ticket is set up I am forced to buy weekend tickets as well, although they are a complete waste as I have never used them. I spend \u00a3210 per month on these tickets and yet the service is appalling. \n\nIf you want to guarantee you arrive at work on time take the train an hour early because the trains are cancelled, (train faults, signalling faults, no driver, trespasser or line side fire on the other side of the country to name some of the excuses which have been provided). \n\nFor a train at 5:25 - specifically 'meeting the needs' of the commuters they lay on 2 pacer carriages from the 1980s and expect 1000 people to cram in. That is a horrific journey, avoid if at all possible. Standing room only, crushed up against the other passengers. They say they have no other carriages available. I have never travelled on that service and found it anything other than overcrowded. Certainly not worth the \u00a3210 monthly fare.\n\nWhen you ask for compensation for being hours late for work or having disruption and delay they send sarcastic and unhelpful written responses which say 'we don't compensate season ticket holders'. (They reserve the right to balance the averages of all of the journeys made over the last month before deciding on their own success). It basically says they care not a jot about the customer. \n\nI, like others on this forum, have been delivered to a random station and told to disembark as the train has now been cancelled. This particular station had no toilets, no cafe, no open waiting room and barely any seats on the platform. There was an hour and half wait until the next possible service. What kind of service cancels a full train of people half way through their journey? \n\nI have also fallen foul of the \"assured the train is running, (wait on the platform for 20mins). Tannoy announcement, \"your train is cancelled\" (4 mins before it is due to depart)\". \n\nThis is a service which is woefully under provided, over priced and very poorly run. The company needs to remember that their customers matter. Their customer service is awful. The state of the trains are awful. \n\nThey changed their name to \"Great Western Railway\" - the arrogance of that is staggering when compared to the service provided.",

And when traveling on GWR at the time, despite paying a lot of money for the ticket, commuting back from Paddington to Reading, for about 6 months, anytime between about 3:30pm and 7pm, I would be unable to get a seat and it was borderline being able to even board the train.

On the whole and over the last 5 years or so the train service has been decent with only the odd bad experience usually due to bad weather or some technical issue. Based on other reviews here perhaps I have been lucky but for me 4* is fair. \nHowever, one very poor aspect of GWR is their web site, poor and illogical navigation and often even a simple transaction needs to be repeated before it will work.  I regularly book a railcard journey to Gatwick but each time the booking process through the system varies and it rarely works first time.  If anyone from GWR is reading this I highly recommend asking a 'normal' user to try booking a Senior railcard for 2 people from Maidenhead to Gatwick and then pay by credit card.  They will not be able to do it, as they should be able, in one simple transaction.  GWR, your IT department sucks.",

I have not taken a trip without seeing at least one passenger suffering from back pain. The toilets are filthy and half the size of the old ones, with no where to hang your coat or bag. The buffet car seems to have been abandoned. The quiet carriage is only labelled as such on the door, in small print. As such, most passengers in it are unaware and so the place is loud with no clear grounds that it shouldn\u2019t be. The reservation system is unclear - you can only see if a seat is booked when squinting at a tiny digital display above the aisle. So useless if you\u2019re looking through windows on a crowded platform trying to find a spare seat. A smaller point, but very ugly interiors. I\u2019ve travelled GWR regularly for twenty years and I am utterly confused as to why they abandoned a previously good train design for these.",

The trains are packed and late most of the time, the organisation at Paddington is a joke and the refund scheme is skewed so heavily in favour of GWR that it is almost impossible for a season ticket holder to obtain a refund for late arrivals.\n\nNeedless to say I expect GWR will take full advantage of the price hikes and add as much as it can to its already outrageous ticket prices.\n\nShame on you GWR. I sincerely hope you lose your mandate next time it is up for renewal you are a truly awful company.\n\nAs a result of your incompetence the already limited time I have with my children in the evening is routinely reduced. Thanks for that.",

The guards on the platform claimed they were putting on bus replacement service...which never turned up either. Just one example of many similar occurrences.\nTrains are more delayed than on time-and every evening the trains in the Bath area are totally rammed with passengers. There should be health and safety standards limiting this-especially as there are no hand rails to hold on to and the carriages are showing signs of age. I\u2019ve seen people fainting and taken ill. The situation is getting worse all the time. Apart from the frustration felt by passengers, at some stage there will be a serious accident resulting in fatalities.\nI feel really sorry for the platform staff-who all seem so dedicated",

        "review_text": "I returned from LHR after travelling 8 hours with my 4 year old to hop on a train in Paddington to Exeter with a pre-booked ticket. 90 minutes in, the train manager told me I was on the train an hour earlier than my ticket stated and I was charged a full fare for the trip. When I told him it was a genuine mistake and I didn't think it was reasonable to charge me like that on a Sunday, it became apparent there was no compassion, empathy or understanding and I was forced to pay up. The train manager did not want to provide his full details, but I told him I would file a complaint as the experience was rather distressing for both me and my 4 year old. I sent GWR a detailed e-mail and sent my tickets and a complaint form, only to follow-up a week later to hear that 'ticket policy is the policy'. No refund... Ah well, so be it then...From now onwards I will consider taking the train to London as a last option over car or bus...I was amazed that customer service seems to feature very low on GWR's list. Many times I have had to contend boarding a train without seating available, many times I was confronted with massive delays and never I complained. For once I made a genuine mistake and the \"GWR rules' got enforced without flinching. \n\nDear GWR, you can't really have it both ways. Customers can be understanding and tolerant, but also demand the same courtesy in return at times. It is sad that he company doesn't train their staff in focusing on the customer but just teaches them to enforce the rules and gives them no discretion to find fair and equitable solutions when minor issues arise.",

On way out  GWR train so crowded people were having to sit in the aisles - so no access to either toilet or purchase of a drink (4hr+ journey). On way back, all the seats appears to have been previously reserved - although many people simply didn't turn up/use the reserved seats. This produced 'seat rage' as people getting on saw others in \"their\" seats and thought they weren't going to get 'their seat' - everyone was British and gave up seats when asked, but what a carry-on. They don't seem to reserve seats like this on Kent/London trains, probably because it doesn't work in practice! Next time I'll give up on my 'green' credentials and just drive - half the cost and less than a quarter of the hassle.\nAnd that doesn't include the hassle of actually purchasing the tickets .....",

Got on next train which was so full many passengers were left behind. Friday morning 23 June. Train to Bristol Parkway 20 minutes late so GWR terminated it at Temple Meads. Asked to change trains again. Next train ran late late too. Friday afternoon 23 June. Asked to leave train at Bristol as it had developed a fault (no men in orange jump suits this time but the rolling stock is over 40 years old...) Next train heading home was the worst overcrowding I have ever experienced in 45 years of train travel. No apology. No explanation. No refund due as I was just under 1 hour late at my destination. So, bounced off a train 3 times in one week. Over 90 minutes late and verging on heat stroke - is that OK GWR?",

I have spent hours on call to GWR over many months now (more than six months and counting).\n\nYou wait 30mins for them to answer the call, and they always tell you its going to get sorted/in the post until you next phone back in 2-3 weeks as nothign has happened - only to find out there was a problem with the last person you spoke to not doing something right. It's just appalling.\nOn 21st Oct I was told the letter has been written and will be in the post once paired with the cheques. Still now, 14th Dec they are telling me the same thing. \n\nRight now I don't believe I'll ever see my money, and I believe GWR deliberately carry out these constant delay tactics so that people who are owed money just give up. \n\nTrying to contact them via Facebook is a farce, they seem to have no access to any information whatsoever and just tell you to call the main telephone number. \n\nIf anyone has any idea how to progress refund claims with GWR with any success I'd be very keen to hear.",

I trued to explain this to the uselsss customer service agents / ticket agents (mature gentlemen in counter 8 and mature lady sitting next to him) both very rudely dismissed my request to issue a duplicate saying I must buy another one as there was 'nothing' they can do.. GWR is the only railway company in whole of Europe to do this (as I travel a lot within EU) and the old pathetic ticketing staff is such a disgrace., as my name was printed on the ticket clearly there is no way one should be able to steal and use them., I'm so annoyed that they got me to buy another one at the cost of 37 quid., shame on you GWR",

        "title": "Website a disgrace and GWR a cynical rip-off outfit.",
        "review_text": "I don't usually have a problem using most websites, but the GWR booking platform is a real disgrace and their customer service is appalling. And I think I know why.\n\nMy first attempt to book a return from Bath to Paddington ended in disaster when I found, after paying the money, I had booked an over-60's ticket when I am not over-60. When I had finished shouting and swearing at myself and had had a sit-down, I went back to review what I had done. Yes, it does tell you what the ticket is, but in the confusing jumble of tables, numbers and boxes that is GWR's excuse for a customer-friendly web site, it's easy to miss. Unfortunately this was only the start of my misery.\n\nMy early efforts to get my ticket cancelled and refunded were prematurely ended by a 20-minute wait on hold to speak to someone by phone before I finally gave up and resorted to their so-called 'web chat' service. Here I was told that I would need to be emailed a refund form that I would have to complete and post back to them before they would consider my case and decide whether or not to give me my money back. Absolutely incredible!\n\nAs it turned out this 'web chat' was never concluded because the woman dealing with me apparently went home, went off for a smoke or maybe just died at her desk because the 'chat' suddenly ended mid-stream with her leaving the line open and me waiting for her to type something. Like the phone call earlier, after a long wait I eventually gave up and went away. Which is what I suspect they wish all their 'problem' customers would get on and do.\n\nSo with little option I had another go at the web chat and at last, this time I got some semblance of a result. The man went to my booking, cancelled the ticket and posted on the page a printable form that I could use to apply for my refund. I would still need to post it back to them however - with the cancelled tickets when they arrived - just in case I was trying to rip them off in some way I suppose, I mean, you can't be too careful these days can you?\n\nA few days later I summoned up the strength to have another go at booking that elusive ticket. After all, it's not like a have a choice, do I GWR..? \n\nI was careful this time, making sure I had the correct dates and times and above all, double checking I had the right ticket for my age group...\n\nSo imagine my surprise when, after paying the now vastly inflated fare having got within a week or so of my travel date, the confirmation came through telling me departure was an HOUR LATER than what I thought I had booked! I was astonished. I couldn't believe my eyes. This time though I stayed calm. I found my transaction and carefully clicked on 'amend booking' which took me back to the booking page. So far so good. It was at this point I discovered what I think is one of the most blatant and cynical rip-offs I've ever experienced from what can still just about be considered a 'public service company'. I was charged an additional \u00a310.00, plus an \u00a38.00 'administration fee' to change a booking a had made minutes before. I still can't get over it!\n\nSo now, for my return ticket from Bath to London, off-peak, booked nearly two weeks ahead, I am paying a grand total of \u00a396.00. And I'm still awaiting the refund (should they decide to give it to me) on the original booking. Nice one, GWR.\n\nI said at the beginning I think I knew why GWR's online booking platform and customer service is so appalling. I'd suggest that if every wrong booking runs up a charge of at least \u00a310.00 to correct and if a substantial number of those bookings are made due to a website that is difficult to read, understand and operate, then there will always be a reluctance by any outfit driven by profit and that measures 'public service' by cost alone, to make any substantial changes, except perhaps to raise their prices even further of course.",

        "review_text": "I agree that if I have to do just an occasional rail journey that it is helpful to book assistance, but I am no less busy or prone to need to travel at short notice as someone able- bodied. It is not helpful when trying to book seats that there is no facility there for disabled customers to indicate their needs. Every time, I have been given seats in the carriages at the far end of the train,too far for me to walk and I would have no access to the buffet service there. I need to book a seat next to the aisle,near a toilet and the buffet in the middle of the train. I have to have a seat,as I cannot stand for more than a couple of minutes and am in pain even then. There is nowhere to put a fold up rollator. It would not fit in the luggage rack or between the seats and I had to lift it onto the table, as there was nowhere else for it. I need to use a wheelchair almost all of the time now and the arrangements are prehistoric. If there are changes of platform, I need help and also must have a seat on the next train, yet no-one ascertains whether anyone has issues before allowing a fee-for-all to commence. Any move to reduce staffing on trains and platforms will make it worse of disabled people. Staff need to be told that even if assistance has not been booked, they should provide reasonable adjustments without moaning as they could often have done what was necessary by the time they have finished complaining.They need to ask what they can do to help,as everyone's needs will be different. Disabled people are not the problem. It is the barriers presented by practical issues and attitudes which must be changed to facilitate disabled people being able to live as independently as possible.",

I then received a very quick response - I wonder if this was because I had mentioned posting on social media - with an explanation of why the trains were cancelled, which would have been the response I was expecting. They also offered vouchers as an apology for not having responded, which I did not expect, but thought was a nice gesture, so I replied with thanks and with my address details.\n\nThat's the last I heard from them; now 33 days ago. I did send a second email 12 days ago in case I had mistakenly emailed an unmonitored account - despite being sure I hadn't, but wanting to give them benefit of the doubt - but have been ignored again.\n\nPresumably GWR only care to talk to you if they think you might tell other people how disdainful their customer \"service\" is. I won't bother travelling with them again; I pity the poor people who are stuck with them for regular transport, it seems they would rather spend huge amounts on rebranding themselves than actually fixing the issues that made their reputation so poor in the first place.

Arrivals and Departures at Redhill using nationalrail.com should give you what you need.  You can get a local train to Redhill to link up, irritating though that is.\r\n\r\nIt's rather worse the other way round.  If the train to Gatwick is late, they will turn it back at Redhill and bounce customers, often with heavy luggage, unceremoniously off the train.  To get to Gatwick they then have to negotiate two sets of steep steps in Redhill station or try their luck with the lifts, which don't always work, and then wait for a commuter train from London on another platform to complete the journey,  The First GWR driver will tell you there are plenty of trains.   No, but there are some.\r\n\r\nThis is a toy town service with loads of level crossings and other things to go wrong along the route.   And, to put it bluntly, this lot don't give a damn about their airport customers.  Find another route if you can.  Otherwise, make sure you can carry your luggage up and down stairs and add an extra forty minutes to your planned travel time - just in case a pig runs across the line.",
