Seriously it\u2019s always been this way and nothing is ever done! You can pay in excess of \u00a3200 for some of their longer journeys and not even get a seat!

On the way back, complimentary trolley with the kindest lady came, and everything was great except the interior being worn down with gaps in seats and tears in carpet.

Both trains were clean, and I enjoyed the journeys, the ticket was surprisingly inexpensive also for the part I travelled :)\n\nOverall, whilst there are flaws, XC can still be great!\n",

Standing room only for a huge amount of people and this is normal as I am unfortunately forced to use your \"service\" regularly. Where is the health and safety here? If this train had come of the rails, many people would die. I truly hate your feckless company, running trains on a shoestring, compromising safety with total contempt for your customers. In addition, no tickets are ever checked. And add having to turf people out of seats that belong to you, because you bothered to reserve your seat, it happens on every single journey with CrossCountry. As for access to toilets, forget it, it is impossible due to the lines of people standing in the aisles. What about disabled people and wheelchairs users? Again, impossible to travel or get assistance. No chance to get refreshments either. Your company is a sick joke and should be reported. You couldn't run a sweet shop, let alone a rail company. I assume the chief executive got his/her big bonus again this year. A truly pathetic excuse for a company, epitomising the state of the rail industry. The sooner nationalisation happens the better.",

I have been advised by East Midlands Trains and GWR of dates on which I can find out if the overtime ban would affect my booked tickets and of alternative arrangements I can make. I today contacted Cross Country to ask the same 2 questions. When will I be able to find out if my train is affected and what alternative service can I use if it is. The gentleman I spoke to asked me 3 times what service etc and 3 times I told him ,3 times I asked him would I be able to use an alternative service,3 times he said hold on I will seek advice.

I had to spend so much money on Ubers to get to work because of these selfish people. I was told that I would be reimbursed for this by 2 of their different members of staff over the phone, only to find out after weeks of chasing them up that I would no longer be reimbursed. Disgusting, it\u2019s not the working classes people problem that your staff strike!!! They\u2019re often rude as-well on the trains and snobby. Cross Country\u2019s trains are late most of the time, because of constant delays, unreliable, I\u2019ve had my train be cancelled many times which just messes up your day so much. The only nice member of staff is a middle aged man who pushes the snack/drinks trolley on the 7:19 train to Nottingham, always nice, friendly, professional and helpful, I wish I knew his name but he can do better than cross country. Imagine I pay \u00a3172.80 a month for this season pass and it\u2019s so expensive and awful, they said I\u2019d get \u00a38 compensation for the strike days \u2026, that\u2019s like a cup of coffee nowadays, like I said at the start for this review what an absolute joke.",

The train from Edinburgh to Plymouth was so overcrowded that the majority of the carriages were crammed with baggage, and the connecting passageways littered with people sat on the floor. \n\nThen our carriage was invaded by a drunken, clearly disturbed individual, with vomit inducing body odour, who proceeded to mutter threateningly under his breath between sips of Special Brew. \n\nTwo seperate issues, really. The first could be solved by more carriages, the second by more attentive staff. This company is failign to provide the kind of standards or service that you expect when forking out \u00a3151.47 for a standard single journey!! \n\nFirst class was available at a cost of \u00a3431, however on passing through to find the train manager, to discuss the gibbering, beer soaked weirdo mentioned earlier; I found first class to be rammed full of very p**sed off people, who clearly were expecting a little more room for their money!\n\nCrosscountry Trains, you are failing.\n \n",

No one would let kids sit down and saw kids looking terrified at being smushed in and unable to sit down. We have two kids with autism and they were panicked! Utter waste of money. But to add to insult they cancel further trains forcing other people onto the already overcrowded train. Not one meme we of staff saying this isn\u2019t safe. Not one person checked our tickets because at no stage could you even get to one side to the other of the train let alone go to the toilet. What happened to the trolley service?

There was another family who got on and one of the family members had words with the guard begging for first class seats at no extra cost. People sat in your reserved seat without a care in the world. First class service does not exist apart from a drink and a snack on a long train journey. You see the staff serving sat for most of the journey. Lots of people standing in first class without first class tickets. It is frustrating for those that pay the extra for first class yet get extremely poor service. They only send a four or five carriage train causing severe overcrowding. They don't believe in refunds if you change your ticket. ",

Totally packed. I had to fight my way through standing people to get off the train. By the time I got to my suitcase people were trying to get on. I said in a loud voice 'please can I get off before you get on?' and one standing passenger said 'you'll be lucky to get off with so many people in the way'. I eventually got off and more people were trying to get on. It was crammed. A very unpleasant trip. ",

        "review_text": "We were on 15:39 service from Oxford to Banbury on 5th of November 2023. Train was packed and we were pushed to stand in first class coach. A disregard and rude lady (not sure how she can serve 1st class) asked my 74-year-old mother to stand but did not help to find her a seat. An extremely awful experience today as we have never met this kind of situation before. Some staffs were very helpful and kind but not the one that we've seen on that coach today.  Poor British standard!!! Those people deserve job cut as they do not do any help to customers (just go around checking tickets) and may show discrimination as well. Some train services may be bad but Cross Country is particularly awful.",

No one should have to experience such hell.\n\nThe stench of overflowing toilets, the lack of oxygen, the sweat... and the discomfort of people who've been on their feet for hours.\n\nWhat an absolute disaster this train company is. It is very hard to imagine any reason for this besides corruption: a pirate company with a friendly-sounding names ratcheting up prices whilst cutting carriages, wages and staff, all to enrich politicians and their mates.\n\nVirgin trains were great.

Running 4 or 5 car trains leads to overcrowding and unsafe conditions. Why do they do it? The reservation system simply doesn\u2019t work with double-bookings leading to fearsome arguments. All this for eye-watering fares which are clearly set to extract as much cash as the market will bear for Arriva\u2019s Directors and shareholders without any investment in new long-distance rolling stock (apart from new carpets promised last year), decent IT, decent catering and proper staff training (eg why it\u2019s a bad idea to use the PA to shout \u201cthere\u2019s no need to sit in the floor\u201d at people who\u2019ve given up fighting their way through overcrowded carriages to find the last remaining seat on the train and are sitting on the floor.\nIn short this company is a national disgrace and the franchise should be terminated NOW.",

Another long wait before being told I'd be refunded in full. \nTwo weeks later received an email saying that it has been escalated and they could not provide any compensation, so I responded saying I'd been told that I would be getting a refund.

The coaches are old and battered but had working power sockets and small tray tables. It\u2019s not really worth the price that I paid for a child\u2019s return which was originally \u00a350.00 but luckily with splitsave I was able to get it for \u00a330 something. Bike spaces were a bit weird as you had to HANG your bike from the front wheel on a hook which I refused to do as my bike is too heavy and large for that. But bike space was decent unlike the Turbostar train. This service is a overpriced service but it was the only direct service from Birmingham.",

        "review_text": "We planned a 60th birthday celebration and travelled from Bristol to York and had a great ideal as a TREAT to travel by train so no one would need to drive and it would be RELAXING, how wrong was I. I haven't travelled that distance before on a train so had no ideal how bad it had become. We had a picnic lunch planned with wine and food for our 4 hour journey to York. I was a bit apprehensive as when booking the tickets we could not reserve the seats. We chose a time off peak times as we thought it would be quiet. We spent 4 hours playing musical chairs & standing in a doorway, the relaxing picnic was a disaster, why should this be the case, they know how many people have bought tickets so surely there should be enough seats for everyone on board. Because of the horrid journey we then had to cut short the last day of the break and catch a train 5 hours earlier as we were dreading the return journey. We got to the station early and gradually the platform filled up. There was then a mad rush to get a seat as I'm sure everyone knew how bad it gets. We started off with 9 carriages at York and gradually at each station people were hunting for a seat. When we reached Birmingham they decided to half the train carriages to 4. The consequences were horrific with people sat on the floor in the aisles. If you were claustrophobic, suffered from Anxiety, had a bladder problem or were disabled you had no chance. If there was a fire you would die or get trampled on. How is this allowed when Health & safety is so prominent within a business environment. I asked the ticket lady about it and she said I feel for you, I get paid to do this, you have paid for this service.  My advice save your cash, we paid \u00a3277.00 for this awful service. ",

        "review_text": "This is an email I still have not had a response to for 10 days......\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address the recent incident regarding the booking made for April 15th, originating from Bristol at 11:35 am, destined for Grimsby via Sheffield.\n\nMy mother, who is disabled due to a previous stroke and experiences apprehension when traveling alone, had arranged for passenger assistance for the entirety of her journey. This decision was made to alleviate her concerns and ensure a stress-free experience with the aid of the passenger assistance services.\n\nOn the 15th, I personally accompanied my mother to the station and awaited the arrival of the Passenger Assist personnel. However, shortly after boarding the train and an hour wait onboard, it was unexpectedly canceled, initiating a chain of distressing events.\n\nUpon cancellation and no passenger assistance to be see my mother found herself struggling to disembark the train without any assistance. She was compelled to seek help from fellow passengers to handle her luggage and navigate to the platform. Despite her efforts to seek assistance from station staff, she was met with inadequate support and was essentially left to fend for herself amidst the chaos of the station.\n\nAs a result of the cancellations and lack of assistance, my mother, who suffers from high blood pressure, was left feeling abandoned, anxious, and vulnerable. The absence of support not only compromised her well-being but also subjected her to unnecessary embarrassment and discomfort, particularly during the futile attempt to secure a seat on another fully booked train.\n\nRegrettably, the ordeal continued as subsequent trains were also cancelled, exacerbating my mother's predicament and leading to a considerable delay in her journey. Faced with the unacceptable circumstances and realising the detrimental impact on my mother's health, I made the decision to intervene and arrange for her prompt retrieval from the station which meant my husband had to leave work to collect her.\n\nUpon contacting Cross Country trains, I was advised to rebook tickets for the following day, April 16th, with the assurance of receiving a refund for the unused tickets. However, upon attempting to obtain said refund at the station, I was met with contradictory information, further adding to the frustration and inconvenience caused by this ordeal.\n\nUltimately, my mother's return home was significantly delayed, resulting in the unfortunate cancellation of an important medical appointment and leaving her with a profound sense of disillusionment towards National Rail services. Her health and wellbeing was compromised and there was no duty of care for my mum who is disabled and was discriminated against by being left alone and unattended on the station. \n\nIn light of these circumstances, I am deeply disappointed by the treatment my mother and other disabled passengers endured. Therefore, I urge for a comprehensive resolution to this matter, including a full refund of the ticket expenses amounting to \u00a3141.90, as well as appropriate compensation for the distress, inconvenience, and disregard for duty of care exhibited.\n\nAttached, please find the tickets for April 16th, alongside those originally purchased for April 15th. I trust that swift action will be taken to address this distressing situation and prevent its recurrence in the future.\nI eagerly await your prompt response and resolution to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJodie Yang-Cooper",

We discovered soon into the journey that the previous two scheduled trains had been cancelled, apparently a regular occurrence.\n\nBy the time the train reached Bristol the train was packed with people standing in the aisles, sitting on the floor between carriages, in the toilets and anywhere else there was space. Suitcases and other luggage littered the floor causing further difficulty and obstructed passages.\n\nTogether with cheap, nasty and uncomfortable seats and effectively being unable to move for long periods of time, the whole experience was appalling.\n\nI can't speak for the standard of staff since we didn't see anyone. Indeed we could quite easily have travelled without a ticket since no-one checked ours, or could have got down the aisle to do so.\n\nHad their been an emergency on the train or it was required to make a sudden stop, there would have been very serious injuries to many customers.\n\nIt's time Cross Country took the comfort and safety of their passengers more seriously before there is a serious accident.",

Firstly at Stoke Train Station the tickets did not need to be checked at the train ticket validation machine, you could just walk onto the platform. The Train arrived and it was packed, even though I had pre booked a seat I could not get on the correct carriage number as the entrance was blocked with people standing in the way. I got on a different carriage and stood for the whole journey to Birmingham International. There was definitely a health and safety issue on this train. I could not see any member of staff on the train, no one to raise my concerns with. I discovered that there was a football match on that day and a lot of the passengers got off at Birmingham New Street. People were allowed to get on the train at each station apart from one station when I saw a member of the rail staff telling someone the train was full.  I do not understand why there were not more carriages on the train, why were there not more trains arranged ? The rail network would have been aware of this match taking place. It was an absolute disgrace, it felt like I was travelling in a third world country. When I tried to complain by email yesterday and today I got a message to say the General enquires form is currently unavailable. I wonder why !",

        "review_text": "I caught the Penzance to Bristol Parkway train on Saturday 2 December at 8.30 am. It was an uncomfortable journey as there were only 4 carriages which caused severe overcrowding. A few of the earlier trains travelling to London from Penzance had also been cancelled so more and more people tried to squeeze onto the train at each stop. It was dangerous with all the aisles of the train full of people having to stand up. I eventually got to Bristol and the train was half an hour late. A lot of people were connecting to another train to try to get to London and they were very anxious and worried about being able to get there during the trip. An elderly lady had to beg someone to give up their seat for her and eventually a passenger on crutches was able to get to a seat to sit down through all the queues of people standing throughout the carriage. It was a worrying, scary and altogether unpleasant journey for most people and no official on that train came along to speak to the passengers just a useless garbled message which you could hardly hear sent over the tannoy to announce where the refreshments could be found! No one could move through the train to get to them! The toilets were blocked if you could even get near them. It was hell!",

I'm aware possessing the IQ of a glass of water is a prerequisite to qualify for senior management within the National Rail service but clearly Cross Country's 'senior team' delve below those standards. I regularly carry extra tissues to mop up their drool if I'm ever in the unfortunate circumstance of being forced on one of their tired, disgusting trains. \n\nI will add that this diatribe pertains only to network managers - The staff on the train and station were absolutely superb (despite being overworked and underpaid) .",

        "review_text": "Absolutely unbelievable policies and customer service! I booked train tickets between Leeds and Sheffield, literally a 1 stop journey which is only 30 minutes. Due to unforeseen circumstances in relation to work, I needed to change the date of travel. Just the date. I called up customer services and I was told that because the admin fee to change the ticket date is greater than what I paid for the ticket, they are unable to change the date OR give me a refund on the ticket. She then put me through to the customer relations team, who I waited for over 30 minutes to answer the phone. They said there is absolutely nothing they can do about my situation, and they cannot change the date or anything. I then asked if they could give me an e voucher or something to use on the website instead of processing a refund. He said they cannot do that as well. That is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous. The fact that I need to pay money to get my own money back is beyond ridiculous. These policies that are set, are idiotic. Now there is no way to get my money back and my complaint is with the Rail Ombudsman. Cross Country is by the worst Rail Operator in the country. The trains are always delayed, very unreliable, your absolutely rammed in their trains, yet  when I\u2019ve previously travelled from Reading to Manchester Piccadilly, the tickets are in excess of \u00a3100 one way. They show no due care for their passengers, and the Government must strip them off their licence immediately. Yet the staff are always going on strike? The trains are always delayed or cancelled? They overbook their trains on purpose because they are a bunch of money grabbing snobs who do not care about anything. I\u2019m reading many other reviews regarding their disgraceful service. \u00a3284 for a first class ticket? That is absolutely insane. I booked an all inclusive holiday in Greece for \u00a3230 per person, 4 star hotel. Avoid like the plague!",

        "review_text": "I travelled on a train from Derby today on the 1145, getting into Berwick at 3:20 pm. I had already upgraded to 1st class via Seatfrog and the seats were pretty comfortable. However, in terms of the catering that was on offer the service was very very poor. It was after about half an hour that we got a hot drink and about half an hour later the gentleman came up to me and took my rubbish and asked me whether I would like something else and I said perhaps another tea he did not mention the fact that food was being served as well. It was only when I heard the next table asked for food that I spoke to him and ask him if food was on offer and was told that he would get back to me. Thankfully there were only three people in front of me and their orders were taken and given. He was very blas\u00e9 and I felt as if I was asking for something extra. Eventually he came back to me and most of the options for the food were no longer available and I was offered a sausage roll or a tuna salad roll which, although we\u2019re not top of my list, I opted for the sausage roll as I was hungry. He then walked away before I said anything else, I then called him back and said that I would like a packet of crisp as well. He did not ask what flavour. He seemed quite annoyed that I was requesting this. Most times I have travelled to London with LNER 1st class and they have been great.  I will be travelling to Derby quite frequently and to be honest this experience has really put me off. I expect a bit of courtesy. I am disabled and was the only Asian person in that carriage (tongue in cheek) I sometimes begin to wonder whether this was the reason that I was being ignored or the fact they I had bid vis Seatfrog for an upgrade and was undeserving. I was very unhappy with the state of affairs.",

On 1 November, the excuse was Storm Cairan. The West Midlands was NOT affected by the storm as only the south coast was mostly affected. The excuse on Thursday was a disturbance on the train. I chatted to some passengers on the delayed train who had travelled for 2hrs or more and they confirmed that no such disturbance occurred. Friday's excuse was that there was a collision on the line. When I finally reached home, I spent some time researching accidents on that line and none were reported. On each announcement for those days, the excuses changed and were inconsistent, so Cross Country were obviously lying about the causes of the delays. In addition, passengers were forced into overcrowded unhygienic cramped conditions, reinforced by the atrocious design of Cross Country trains as opposed to normal trains, i.e. Avanti, Chilterns etc. On Cross Country trains, passengers are forced to stand on aisles and outside smelly toilets, constantly assaulted by automatic doors. It is obvious that these awful trains were designed to be uncomfortable. When I applied for a refund, Cross Country added insult to injury by offering only a fraction of the cost of my ticket in compensation.\n\nI would strongly urge passengers to `always' claim compensation from Cross Country trains until they are finally sued or put out of business.\n\nCross Country trains are a total and utter disgrace and treat passengers with contempt.",

Their customer service staff are rude, arrogant and oblivious to the reasonable needs of their customers.\nI was especially horrified on a recent first class service to Wolverhampton. The train was overcrowded, and they had failed to provide the extra carriages necessary for the route. First class itself was dirty, and staff did nothing to prevent a prisoner on day release from using the carriage (despite not carrying a ticket) and harassing the customers. It is immoral to solicit (often) double the fare, and to completely neglect your customers in this way.\nNevertheless, X Country hold the monopoly on a number of major rail routes, and know that people will travel with them regardless of conditions.

The train was full of self entitled students from Reading onwards. It amazes me that they can afford festival tickets but not train tickets so they sat wherever they wanted. None of them were checked to see if they had tickets. They were rude. Why extra coaches were not allocated to the train service we were on is beyond me given how many people crammed themselves onto the train at Reading. Instead they open up first class to accommodate for the over crowding and announce partial refunds over the barely audible loudspeaker due to the noise of drunk festival goers. I paid all that extra money to avoid travelling by coach. Now I wish I'd gone by coach instead. I couldn't wait to get off the train at Birmingham New Street, as the train journey was unbearable. As I exited the train, one woman had to shield her young daughter in order to prevent her from being pushed around on the train due to a lack of seating. Your company need to invest in new cleaner trains that can accommodate for over crowding instead of wasting money on HS2. I feel sorry for your staff. It must be shamefully embarrassing for them to have to represent what was once a flagship train company. It's no wonder they still go on strike given the working conditions that they still have to suffer, not to mention some of the passengers. So thoughtless for other people travelling on your trains. Where are the British Transport Police and why aren't they on board these trains to stop these undesirables from ruining other people's journeys home from their holidays. Very dissapointing indeed.",

        "review_text": "Impressive to have achieved a 1.5* average rating, especially when 0 is not an option.  I\u2019m afraid CrossCountry, my review isn\u2019t about to improve the situation. \n\nWhere do I start? I am fortunate that my job affords me the excitement of visiting places like Birmingham and Bristol on a periodic basis. The counter to this privilege is my journey from Leeds dictates I take a CrossCountry train.  \n\nLet me try and give you a flavour of a typical journey:\n\nAs the train pulls into the platform and you eyeball a coupe of carriages,  the sinking feeling of the thing being absolutely rammed sets in.  You naively find your coach, try and overlook the raw sewage/ blocked toilet smell as you alight and then join a queue of commuters trying to navigate the frankly insane seat booking system as the carriage door repeatedly closes on your testes. \n\nYou arrive at your seat and see a 93 year old woman sat in it, so without the coldness of heart to boot her out, you think ah I\u2019ll find another seat. Once you\u2019ve worked out what seats are reserved or aren\u2019t, you sit in one that says \u201cmay be reserved later\u201d to find yourself rudely ejected at Sheffield. \n\nIn the short time you had a seat, you thought oh I\u2019ll get a bit of work done. Firstly the fold down table is smaller than a cigarette packet, and has this kind of low friction edging which means your laptop flies off at any moderate change in acceleration. \n\nThe \u201cwifi\u201d is near useless.  A man selling crisps and teas clouts your leg with a trolley. \n\nYou now arrive at Derby. For some unknown reason the driver realises he\u2019s got there ten mins early (silly sausage does this every time), so you wait for a solid 12 mins in a platform with neither Wi-Fi or mobile network coverage. \n\nYou eventually get to Birmingham, and breath a sigh of diesel filled air as relief and get on with your day, feeling relaxed and ready to take on the world, having been relieved of \u00a375 for the privilege.  \n\nCleanliness - 0\nEfficiency - 1\nComfort - 0\nSpeed - 1\nOverall - 0.",

        "review_text": "Cross country trains are the worst train line in the country. Disgusting, out of date, grubby and cramped seating, extortionate prices, and ALWAYS delayed service. But on top of that, the staff are absolute JOBSWORTHS. For context: myself and my partner had an open return return from Bath to Manchester for a weekend away. Unfortunately we missed our planned train home on a Saturday which was the last train that would get us back to bath that day a 6.30pm. We tried to book a last minute hotel in the city, but due to Halloween weekend all were full, so we managed to get across to York for a nice little stay  in a boutique hotel. The next day, we hopped on a train that would take us direct to Bristol then could change for bath, as it was a cross country train and our open returns stated 'all permitted routes' (which we had paid nearly \u00a3100 for), and there had been many cancellations and delays of most trains back to the south east and west that day, we presumed getting this train would be fine. Due to the cancellations, we couldn't even get a seat and stood in the carriage doorway for most of the route. Then, we were unfortunately met with a ticketing officer who all I'm going to say would have had a wonderful career following orders in 1940s Germany!! We explained our situation, including the delays and cancellations, and I stated that our return was a 'all permitted routes' open ticket, this was our only reasonable train to get on. He was having none of it, claiming we would need to spend an additional 80 pounds each to stay on the train or he would kick us off. A to-and-fro then ensued as I stated there are no clear rules online for what a 'permitted route' for a return ticket entails, and despite him calling it a grey area, he refused to keep us on board, instead, kicking us off, making us change at derby, then stoke on trent, then bristol, then bath, as this was the 'permitted route' this added four hours onto our already five hour long journey home on a Sunday. My partner is also type 1 diabetic, so being on the road for such a long time is really not ideal for her health. Overall I hope you are happy mr cross country See You Next Tuesday for making an already stressful weekend of travel particularly excruciating.",

That attitude was also clear on the journey \u2013 they just don't care. Customer service is something they seem never to have heard of.\n\nTrain was late leaving by several minutes.\n\nThe train was filthy. Crumbs, broken glass and liquid on the floor. Seats dirty. Toilet dirty and stank. This is old stock and it shows. The company's money is going to shareholders, not customers.\n\nAds for 1st class say: \"Reclining seats\". Really? Absolutely not. These are old style, upright seats with no extra space and no extra leg room.  \n\nAds say: \"...get stuck into some work.\" How? There is not even a plug at any of the seats \u2013 this is supposed to be 1st class! Internet is patchy at best, and incredibly slow.\n\nAds say: \"Extra table space\". My Macbook Air wouldn't even fit on the table. \n\nAds say:\n\n\"You can make use of the quiet atmosphere by taking a nap or getting stuck into some work.\"\n\nIt is anything but quiet. People on phones, loud music through tinny headphones, people sharing their conversations with the world \u2013 and staff doing nothing to control it. I had to wear earphones not to listen to anything but to try to block out the noise.\n\n\"Complimentary food and drink\"? There isn't any. Not even a drink. Not even to buy. When queried, the stock answer is \"not available on every route\". Then they should make that clear in their advertising.\n\nAds call it: \"The ultimate way to travel for on-the-go work or an extra comfy journey. Kick back, relax and enjoy; it's well worth the upgrade.\"\n\nIt absolutely is NOT worth the upgrade. I paid a lot of money for a 1st class ticket when there was no difference between 1st class and the rest of the train. I spent a three hour journey hungry, thirsty, unable to concentrate and seriously fed up. I wish I had read reviews before I booked. I certainly won't be using this company again.\n\nThe information on the website is seriously misleading. There is no way anyone should be charged for 1st class when this experience is not even second class. It's absolutely outrageous. \n\nAvoid this company if you have any other alternative \u2013 and certainly DO NOT to pay extra for 1st class.",

Then on the Train, she got a backwards seat when she asked for forwards, then worst of all, the Train ran an HOUR late, and she missed half her work meeting she has to attend once a month, felt so sorry for her, I don't know how a Train company messes up that badly, i've noticed they can get so packed and hot and smell from the outside, anyway, after this incident, we can't trust this company anymore, please improve however you can Cross Country...",

I've recently had a reservation which didn't even show on my allocated seat. \n\nOther than the train actually moving there are none. \n\nCons:\nNo catering - for long haul journeys absolutely dreadful. Every other first class service I've used on other lines at least provides water. \nFilthy coach\nFilthy bathroom \nStaff with poor attitudes\nBarely anyone around to check tickets \nIf you don't travel first class you may as well accept you will be likely to be standing or crushed with other people. \n\nI've contacted them in the past, always an excuse and never anything they can solve. Used to be a great service, needs overtaking and a new supplier. 0/10. \n\nMight try journeying to London and going north that way in the future.",

        "review_text": "On Monday I travelled on the 13.16 Departure from Leamington Spa to Newcastle.\n \nThe train was 24 minutes late in departing meaning I would miss my connection at Birmingham New Street .\nIt was two trains but tiny (4 carriages I think ). It was full of people returning North from a major Music Festival at Winchester. Surely they have a way of predicting this number of passengers due to the fact that thousands of people got off on Friday then back on again on Monday when it finished. They manage to increase prices based on demand so perhaps this technology might be shared with the \u201csize of train department\u201d and staff on the platform stopping people getting on when it\u2019s full.\n \nThe train was packed. Not just no seats, no standing room either. Dangerous over loading but never mind. Birmingham New Street isn\u2019t a long journey and the train manager was \u201cstressed\u201d but charming.\n \nNot unexpectedly the connection was late too, so my journey was back on course.\n \nI made Platform 10. At the last minute the announcer said \u201cChange of Platform\u201d So Platform 8 it was. Not far\n \nThe train arrived and left more packed than the first one but a much longer train. I eventually got a seat at Durham (10 minutes from Newcastle) after a 5 hour, 15 minute standing journey.\n \nAs the train was over one hour late yesterday  I tried to claim under the \u201cDelay Repay\u201d Service whilst on my return journey. I completed the form, downloaded the ticket then your internet failed and wiped the form. So, I called Customer Services and 15 minutes later when I did get through I lost the call and so far they haven\u2019t called back (1 hour)\n \nIts an incredible list of incompetence and only a slight improvement on the last time I travelled to Newcastle when the train broke down north of York, took 2 hours to be dragged back to York, where we were made to run to get on an LNER Service to reach Newcastle two hours late\n\nI sent this to the CEO tom DOT joyner crosscountrytrains (co.uk) who so far has failed to respond\n \n \nIan Cassie\n \nM 079 73 74 1122\nNo junk mail or pasted paragraphs from standard reports.",

I had an aisle seat, but you end up being buffeted by standing customers for the entire trip. In amongst the chaos is the advent of split ticketing (cheaper apparently). Part way into the journey a lady turfed someone out of the seat beside me only to declare that two stops later she had to move because of a different seat reservation for the second half of her journey. This causes bad temperedness on top of the overall distressing experience. It simply cannot be safe to cram trains to this extent. These trains are uncomfortable without all this, you get less leg room than you would on a budget flight, there isn't enough luggage space because the overhead space is so narrow, and the luggage are at the end of carriage is virtually inaccessible because the aisles are blocked. I do not see how a company can act like this without sanction. As many other reviewers have said, I would not give them any stars if I could. \nMy advice to people considering using cross-country is don't unless its for short hops between stations.

As an inspector walked past they asked if they could have a cup of tea, his response \u2018there\u2019s no catering on this train at the moment, but there will be at some point, I\u2019ll find out when for you\u2019 he got off the train at Birmingham and never returned to tell the ladies when they would be able to get their tea. The staff just don\u2019t care. My journey down to Bristol the day before was delayed by 40 minutes at derby because a driver was late for work ! No concern at all that the 300 or so passengers had homes to go to, and were paying for the privilege of waiting on someone bothering to turn up for work. Cross country you\u2019re a disgrace and don\u2019t deserve any pay rises ! Sort your service out.",

        "review_text": "Feel victimised and bullied by this company. Where do I even begin to start\u2026. \nMy and my mum who is aged 76 was travelling on 18th July 2023 to Carstairs in Scotland, via Carlisle from Keighley on the original route however there was a line closure even though we did not have tickets for the cross country service we was advised by staff we could use this service 12.08 Leeds to Edinburgh due to a fatality on the line on our original route. We explained going through different check points through Leeds station what had happened and everyone understood (we was advised to take this route) even got an intinary printed of the journey we got told to take. When we got on the cross country service from Leeds to Edinburgh the women conductor had an issue with this and would not allow us to explain. She was abrupt and dismissive and took our name and address. Well of course now we have both been issued a prosecution case and they cross country are pressuring us into paying this within 14 days! I\u2019m absolutely disgusted! What this screams is do not listen or trust train staff and believe me I won\u2019t be doing in the future! The fine is being appealed and I am seeking help from citizens advise about these manipulators. Not to mention this conductor kept mine and my mums original tickets probably in a bid to make out we had no tickets at all! Disgusted by this women\u2019s lack of care and understanding and general customer service i asked where I should make a complaint to and she even lied to me and said transpennine express. So upset by events it was only the following day i realised she had lied. My advise is to avoid this company at all costs they clearly do not care about their customers only about their pockets! I seriously hope they take my complaint about the staff member seriously as she is an absolute embarrassment to the company! This is not over for me I will be seeking legal action and taking the matter to the ombudsman if need be. Push me far enough and I will even seek attention from the media on this matter!",

The poor hostess then had to lock herself away for her own safety, no ticket checks! cross country you must be loosing money hand over fist.  The supporters were both noisy and intimidating. Having experienced a very unpleasant  and feeling very vulnerable journey to York we felt very relieved to get off the Train. However this didn't have a patch on our return journey home after a day of the supporters drinking, I have never felt so unsafe in all my life, they completely took over the whole of the Train, one man fell on top on my husband, it made me cry, again no tickets checked. ( don't blame the conductor) again locked themselves away for there safety. Railway Police came into our carriage to help calm them down. Cross Country Trains you should be ashamed of yourselves. HS2!! ? All this money being ploughed into a railway system to save 10min on a journey you really need to get your priorities right.

Luckily I kicked up a fuss and after about 5 minutes and another passenger, who's luggage was in the wheelchair space, getting funny with me. I finally got into the space. But whilst having to wait, I had people behind me waiting to get onto the train! Plus I'm not the first person this has happened to!

I sent them an email asking for explanation, but the only action they took was to send a general (not specifically addressed to me) saying something like: \"we got it wrong this time!\". You sure did! Am I right to guess that you were overwhelmed by the response of your Customers trying to use that discount that you have decided to withdraw the offer? Well, let me tell you something; this has damaged your reputation very, very badly! I am also withdrawing any future train bookings with you, and choose a competitor.",

        "review_text": "On Saturday 27th May 2023, I travelled from Newcastle to Darlington on the 15:39 to Plymouth and rather surprisingly arrived into Darlington on time. That\u2019s the only positive part of the trip. Cross-country are known for their voyagers and yes\u2026 they are terrible. They are smelly and a danger to our environment. Running on Diesel power right below overhead power lines (the better option), is a right joke. It\u2019s Polluting for the environment especially when cross-country serve routes that overhead power lines are available and that they can\u2019t connect their smelly trains to. When I boarded the train at Newcastle, it smelt of fresh human waste. The vestibule was sticky and hot, hardly any legroom, crammed as much seating as they can into one carriage. Worse for me as, the tray table was rattling for the 30 minute journey or so. During summer I\u2019m planning a trip to Birmingham New Street and I have no intentions on going on a direct cross country service. I will take other train operators to avoid these deadly voyagers. In addition to this, some, not all staff are extremely disrespectful and clearly don\u2019t like their job. Absolutely terrible attitudes towards customers and extremely overpriced catering combined with a train that is almost like it\u2019s been taped together makes this a company that needs to: Buck their ideas up, sort themselves out, and not offer such terrible levels of customer service. I could give minus stars to this company. Zero stars is way beyond generous for the level I experienced.",

Went to ticket agent at Birmingham New Street yesterday and was told we got the last 2 reservable seats. While not together very close. Took train today. Huge step up from platform to car. Ripped luggage as everyone pushing in. No attendents to help. Reserved seats were 6A and 9A ; however actual seats numbered 1,2,3, etc. No alpha. Wasn't only one confused. Resulted in people sitting anywhere and moving if a newer passenger demanded it. Insufficient luggage storage for international travellers. Overhead bins only handle small back packs and carryons. A real gong show! One positive - train arrived in Edinburgh earlier than scheduled.",

Old, dilapidated and hugely noisy and polluting rolling stock with overpriced tickets and reliability and punctuality which is truly world leading for awfulness. \n\nThen I had the misfortune of using them to ferry my elderly Mum home. Her train was cancelled and she was put away onto another train requiring two changes, only it was the wrong train which was heading in entirely the wrong direction. Realising this too late she got of at the next station and attempted to head to Birmingham to change trains, but her train was late so she had to run to make her connection. Once on that train it stopped to unexpectedly detach half of its carriages forcing her to stand squashed together in what little remained of the train for hours. \n\nThere are some companies which are so terrible as to be irredeemable.  Cross Country is one. It should be shuttered and renationalised.",

Got on a 1405 train from Edinburgh, doors were open and train was due to depart in 5 minutes but was in darkness. The guard had been telling people to get on. Once on the doors wouldn\u2019t open between carriages and we were left standing until a rather rude employee came stomping up the train complaining that someone had left the doors open and we shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to get on due to the train being unlikely to be going anywhere soon. Turns out there was an electrical fault. Eventually we were told to get off and onto the front carriages and they uncoupled three carriages which were causing the train to fault. Once aboard we were then told to get into our reserved seats even though some of the carriages were missing. We alll were shuffled about and it took over half an hour for the staff to get people into their right seats. We set off 35 minutes late. We were on the train for 3 hours but there was no buffet cart. Apparently they were short staffed and couldn\u2019t staff the trolley or the buffet carriage. Arrived 25 minutes late to York and had missed my connection and had to wait a further 45 mins for another train. I arrived at my destination over an hour late but cant get any compensation as they managed to arrive within the 30 min period and my second train was a different company. So dirty train, rude staff, delayed and no refreshments. Might have been a one off? The return journey was on time but again the train was filthy and once seated we never saw a staff member for 1.5 hours. Again an announcement to say due to staff shortages there was no refreshment trolley or buffet carriage so another 3 hours unable to buy food or drink. A generally substandard service and it would have been cheaper to drive so next time I will.",

I really will think again about booking a train journey with cross country.. It was expensive as well.. no drinks, nothing.. apparentley there was a trolley for drinks, but they couldnt get down any aisles so what was the point? cant comment on staff, never saw any, no-one to try and work out what was happening and why people were left stood with kids when they had pre-booked seats.. probably didnt want anything to do with the tension.. It would have been cheaper and far less stressful to have gone down to london and then back up to birmingham with LNER or virgin..awful journeys.",

Only 5 carriages for a train travelling almost the entire length of the UK...\n\nPeople were standing in the aisles and corridors and even sitting in the toilets. There is no aircon in the spaces between carriages and the temperature was intolerable. I knew it was going to be bad when the conductor apologised for the \"SEVERE OVERCROWDING\" as soon as we set off. Ending up standing for 2 hours of a 3 hour journey, some were not so lucky. \n\nNot to mention that even if you do get a seat, there is almost no legroom, the overhead storage is tiny, and the entire train stinks of chemical toilet. \n\nPaid \u00a3150 for the privilege. Never again.\n\nOvercrowding is a long term problem for XC but they show no interest in fixing it or even taking ownership of the problem, all I got from staff were a list of excuses that we've all heard before. For starters they could require their staff to work Sundays so they can run a full schedule and stop treating their customers like cattle.\n\nMy advice is to avoid travelling by Cross Country at all costs. It's just as cheap to hire a car and the coach is cheaper still.",

        "review_text": "Where do I begin? \n\nI abhor this company with every fibre of my body! Their trains are woefully cramped with not enough seats for the journeys that they make. Whoever thought it was a good idea to put a 5 carriage train on journeys that can go from Scotland to Plymouth deserves sacking! Their seats are uncomfortable, the interior is so dated and their voyager trains always have a funny smell to them also.\n\nThe pricing is purely extortionate. The audacity they have to charge you for such a pathetic service really gripes me. I travelled Newcastle to Birmingham and back cramped, stressed and with no signal for the duration of the journey but because they have monopoly of the route they know they can get away with such a tinpot service!\n\nThe alternative? There isn't one and that's the problem! If I want to visit family in the West Midlands from Newcastle I either go direct with them for an extortionate fee or I travel via Carlisle or London adding hours onto my journey! \n\nI would genuinely rather get a Megabus or National Express and save my money than travel with CrossCountry again. Literally not a single positive thing about them!",

As a disabled passenger I was told I should book assistance to be first on the train. I pointed out no point in being first if there are NO seats. I told them I was not prepared to tramp up and down the train looking for a seat dragging my tiny case behind me.  After sometime I held out and was given a code to activate at the station to claim my booked seat. (no plan B if this failed). Then a strike was announced for 3 jan.\nSo I emailed them, after 2 weeks they told me to book assist, I replied no! \n\nSo I also, emailed Collette Casey CEO- still waiting of an acknowledgement noting as of 22 Dec 2022.\n\n I only want a seat! 19 Dec they email me with details of Assistance telling me to arrive 20 minutes before the train and I would be helped to a vacant seat. (if they are vacant then book me one?)\nSo I have changed my entire trip home as this is the second leg of my trip, I now have a seat booked by using LNER. How hard was that???\nHow are disabled people to live life to the full and when all they want is a booked seat but booked their ticket with another company as they find LNER easier to use.",

After several months and emails I have not received a reply. The present email address for Cross Country is not recognised. If you have to claim it is essential you photocopy tickets before sending them, as they will say they haven't been received. Also lack of information at Birmingham New Street is useless. The arrival board is not up to date and staff never know when train will arrive and often tell you it has gone when it hasn't. In some cases even cancelled. There is plenty of staff at New Street walking around looking important with iPads. The new uniforms don't make for efficiency. Unfortunately, Cross Country have a monopoly of this particular route so there is no alternative.",

People sat with young children in the sections between carriages, outside the toilets on wet floors (I dread to think why they were wet). This 'service' felt like we were cattle being shoved onto carriages for our final journey to the abattoir. At what point is this overcrowding considered unsafe?\nI have a solution for Cross Country... buy a couple of extra carriages and hitch them onto your peak services. Give customers a seat reservation by default instead of this nonsense about having to message for a seat reservation - I know there will be no-shows but whatever percentage you are calculating this will be, it is way off. Then once all the tickets for a train are sold... stop selling any more tickets \ud83d\ude09\nThen watch as your reviews massively improve and more people start using your trains because it's actually a bearable experience. \nIf you need any more assistance let me know?\nTrustpilot you have my permission to share my email address with Cross Country so they can hire me as their new CEO \ud83d\ude01",

        "review_text": "One star is one star too many.\nAs a special treat my wife and I booked a first class return between Dundee and Sheffield departing on 22 October and returning on 27th. \nI am over 6\u20196\u201d tall and am approaching my 79th birthday. The length of my femurs prevent me from sitting on a standard seat. I have been known to break the back of the seat in front in an attempt to fit. So I always book priority seats which accommodate me easily\u2026\u2026IF ONLY\u2026\nI had hoped I would be allocated one and not have to seat surf when on board. \nIt was with trepidation that I received our reservations. I would have expected adjoining seats-but no..\nOn boarding it transpired we were located in front of each other and directly in front of (thankfully) unreserved priority seats on the other side of the aisle. So we moved.\nShortly afterwards a lady who had an LNER booking but no seat reservation boarded and tentatively approached my original seat showing a Dundee to Sheffield reservation. To help out I suggested she took the seat as I had reserved it but would not be using it. She could transfer to my seat at Sheffield as it remained un booked if anyone had the seat she was using reserved beyond Sheffield.\nSounded ok to us BUT when the tickets were inspected all hell let loose with both of us being told that was not how the system worked\u2026As she was not a XCountry client she could not have priority over a XCountry one should one turn up with a ticket for the seat\u2026.I pointed out one had turned up and was sitting in a priority seat which was not reserved and would be mine until Sheffield when if need be she could swap. At which point the screaming of the three staff reached a crescendo so I had to turn my hearing aids off and she moved on to another (unbooked) seat which she occupied to Sheffield and beyond\u2026\nSo not a good start but the seats were comfortable. Complimentary service was ok but limited\u2026\n\nRETURN was XCountry to York. As expected we had separate non priority seats with a vacant unbooked pair of Priority seats opposite - to which we transferred, Thankful to leave at York. Carriage had been old and dirty .\nThere we transferred to an LNER Azuma train. It was immaculate and although we were placed on table seats there was leg room for me.\nStaff were plentiful and well trained. Service was prompt and the lunch (note XCountry) was superb. Complimentary wine appreciated. Only problem here was a detachable head rest located between shoulder blades - which was detached..\n\n\nSO I will never ever travel first class again.   It is just a waste of money \u00a3650 for that experience.\nI will use LNER for future trips to Sheffield and hope their booking system allows for priority seats to be both identified and delivered.",

Had to wait an hour for the next available train, good thing I had nothing to be on time for when I arrived :)\nTrain arrives, platform is absolutely packed (as there were about 3 other train cancellations so 3 trains worth of people including the people already on) we all get on. Seats full, every single carriage entrance full but not overly full, was bare-able for the time being, second stop a small number got off, more piled in this meant 0 room at all this carried on the whole 2 hour 30 minutes I was on the train. 10 people squished in the toilet is how bad it was :). As you can imagine it was boiling. Peoples bags, people pressed against you wasn\u2019t nice. More people proceeded to get on, even though there was absolutely no room! Surely this should be a health and safety issue? Was absolutely disgusting it honestly felt like I was on the tube. Also a man decided he couldn't wait 2 minutes for the toilet so proceeded to wee with the door open surrounded by people, was shouting, also asking underage girls their age :) \nWill NEVER go with this service again",

We asked the conductor for advice and he reassured us that the current train would now be stopping at our stop too, as did the Twitter handler on Cross Country's account.  Very happy.  Stayed on train at our connecting station and further reassured by an announcement including our destination station.  2 minutes later another conductor checked our tickets and told us we weren't stopping there and the announcer had made a mistake, so we were stuck on the train for a further hour.  After politely complaining to the conductor and showing them the Twitter messages they contacted the announcer for confirmation.  He then decided to try and humiliate us by announcing to the train that we had got on the wrong train (we'd been on it for 4 hours) and that it was our fault we were stuck.  I wrote to their customer services to complain and have received nothing back.  Actively avoiding travelling on their trains as a result, what a shower.....",

On boarding, the cancellation of an earlier service and the removal of two carriages meant that the reservations were voided. Although the train manager announced that reservations were valid no staff were available to enforce them. In carriage C there were over 30 people standing, making it impossible to access staff  toilets and catering. Thete was absolutely no attempt to observe basic health and safety issues or the needs of elderly passengers left standing while younger passengers retained their seats throughout the journey. No one between New Street and Newton Abbot checked the tickets and in future I will not bother to buy one because even as a free ride it was unacceptable. I already have a claim for a refund pending due,supposedly, to the high number of claims. Correction. It is not caused by the high number of vlaims but the rubbish offered as a service.",

My experience is that this is Always a busy route often with some standing but this journey was exceptional. The service often has 10 carriages but today it was 5.  As I was in an aisle seat I was constantly being bumped into.  Awful journey, hot, sweaty, noisy and unsafe due the  number standing and cases blocking aisles. No refreshments available.

This Company has no regard for their customers well being whilst travelling on their trains. Firstly, apparently there had been a announcement at Southampton that all reserved seats are now unreserved due to a electronic failure. No regard to customers who are travelling from other stations, and have reserved and now there is no where to sit. Seriously who are they trying to fool. More like they sell as many tickets as they can for greed. Reserved tickets is a pot luck game these days. If anybody is sat in your reserved seat, not a chance are they moving for you when they have paid the same standard price. They also give an option to book a quiet coach. Seriously, are you just having a giggle at us. Luggage areas are also jam packed. People are using these trains from the Airport. Therefore people are having to stand in the aisles with there luggage. No chance of getting to the toilet either. People with disabilities are also experiencing a dreadful journey. I dread to think what would happen in case of an emergency. This is only going to get worse. Absolutely disgusting.",

        "review_text": "Had a terrible experience with this company early this morning. After a 9 Hour overnight flight to Manchester Airport I caught a Transpennine train into Manchester Piccadilly, using my previously bought open return ticket. That train was fine, but I then boarded a Cross Country train to Stoke. Big mistake. The ticket I had was an off peak one, and my 'crime' was to use it during the \"peak hour\" time of 8.45. Don't know why this is a \"peak hour\" since there was only 3 other people in the carriage.\nI then encountered one of the most obnoxious members of staff who, after being rude to another passenger told me I had to \"upgrade\" my ticket, which meant I had to pay him again for the entire single journey, including the first train which was not even provided by Cross Country ! Came away feeling like I was robbed, having paid for the same journey twice, and been treated like a criminal despite having a ticket that would have been fully acceptable just 45 minutes later. It had been seen and accepted by other rail company staff and got me through 3 barriers so why this over-officious cross country worker saw fit to question it once the journey was underway and I had no option but to pay makes me think that Cross Country definitely care more about profit than customer satisfaction.\nI have complained officially to Cross Country but am less than optimistic about getting a response.... Do they ever respond to complaints on this site either ?\nBad service and had staff. Avoid where possible.",

        "review_text": "Bournemouth to Manchester Crosscountry Service\nFriday 20th May 2022\n\nI had the unfortunate experience to pick up this service at Basingstoke yesterday (Fri 20th May 2022) at 1247; it formed the second part of a journey from Salisbury to Oxford. \n\nThe train arrived in to Basingstoke on time (good start) but thereafter things went downhill rapidly. The service consisted of the usual far-too-small, 5-carriage Pendolino. And as usual, it arrived in to Basingstoke packed full of passengers, many of which were already standing (no surprise for regular users). Perhaps not a \"completely usual\" circumstance for this type of Crosscountry service in my experience, but certainly very common, and, in my opinion, far too common and completely unnecessary ! \n\nWhy, oh why, does Crosscountry think that busy routes such as that from Bournemouth to Manchester will be well served by such a small train, especially on a Friday ?  In contrast, at Basingstoke, one can often see the SWT services running from Weymouth to Waterloo that consist of 10 or more carriages.\n\nOn this occasion, the inadequate size of the service provided was exacerbated by the fact that one of the 5 carriages (coach F at the rear) was inaccessible because of a door failure. Thus, a predictably-busy service, being served by a train of already inadequate capacity, was being run at only 80% capacity. A pity that this situation could not have been highlighted with an announcement at Basingstoke station or perhaps a sign on the outside of carriage F; the rush for the \"empty\", but wholly inaccessible, seats at the rear of the incoming service might then have been avoided. Announcing this to passengers once they had managed to squeeze on to the train at Basingstoke, and at subsequent stations, was not particularly useful.\n\nSuffice to say that my journey from Basingstoke to Oxford was uncomfortable and involved standing, although I was under the impression that my ticket had purchased the use of a seat !  Vestibules were full of people standing and the aisles within the carriages were likewise often full. I note that the guard made no appearance to help out with problems involving pre-booked seating and comments about moving from the vestibules in to the carriages to take advantage of the air conditioning were not particularly helpful; there was no room inside many of the carriages and the air conditioning inside my carriage was certainly not turned on. One hot, sweaty little boy in a T-shirt and shorts, seated close to where I was standing, repeatedly asked his mother why it was so hot !\n\nI often wonder why Crosscountry aren't obliged to read the veterinary regulations relating to the transport of cattle?   I am no expert, but I'm sure that conveying cattle in cramped, uncomfortable spaces at high speed is regarded as not being good for their well-being, for their individual, personal safety and does not represent good value for the charge of carriage. One wonders then why Crosscountry would choose to treat their human passengers to journeys that veterinarians would not be legally permitted to have cattle endure !\n\nReturning from Oxford later on a busy Friday evening, I braced myself for a repeat performance from Crosscountry. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the service arriving from the north consisted of two Pendolinos coupled together. This then provided adequate seating capacity down to Basingstoke and presumably beyond, accommodating the predictably-large number of passengers using the service at Oxford, Reading and Basingstoke on a Friday evening. So, it would appear that Crosscountry know what is required to provide a good, basic service; perhaps then we might hope that it can be demonstrated more often, if not all of the time !",

The seats were very cramped and uncomfortable, and the space for luggage was quite inadequate, especially as some of the other passengers were using it as an airport service.\nI do not often travel by train and I had been looking forward to this as an alternative to driving.

        "review_text": "I travelled from Stockport to Bournemouth on Good Friday, and back again on Saturday April 30th. I paid for a Weekend Upgrade on both legs of my journey. \n\nOn the way to Bournemouth I was treated like a king, and was given free sandwiches, coffee, crisps and soft drinks. On the return journey I was treated like a peasant: \n\nThe service was jam packed. Quite a few people were standing in my first class carriage - and the rest of the train was packed like sardines. It was impossible to move through the train to where the buffet carriage was, so I politely asked Cross Country's member of staff in Coach A if a sandwich could be brought to me the next time the train stopped? She told that this was not possible, which meant that the only way I could get any food on the train was for me to rush to the carriage with the buffet trolley at the next stop, buy my food, wait until the train stopped again and race back to my first class carriage. I was also told that I would have to pay for my food. \n\nI have given a 2 star review because of the good service offered on the outward leg of my journey. Clearly my rating would be 1 Star if I based it solely on the return leg of my trip. \n\nI fully appreciate that some services are quiet and others are extremely busy, and know that this affects the traveling experience. But Cross Country trains should be aware that some of their staff are downright rude, and put those that are on a customer care course.",

Though on-board staff are usually friendly, the general attitude from the train company about these occurrences is \"I guess this is your problem now\" with no refunds or offers of compensation despite the relentless inconvenience they cause. Writing this while stranded at Exeter St David's en route to Sheffield after having had to drive backwards back to the station because of a train engine failure. Staff advised us to take a train to Bristol and change there, but this was so full (after also suffering a delay of 73 minutes) that we couldn't get on.",

        "review_text": "I travel regularly with XC and it's getting increasingly difficult to not only buy first class tickets but it's also virtually impossible to reserve seats in trains that I absolutely know are running practically empty. \nSince covid started, my advance ticket prices have more than trebled. These fares are unregulated. Therefore they can be increased without any limitations or restrictions.\nI usually book around 4 weeks in advance, by which time all journeys and train times are confirmed. More often than not there are zero tickets available to buy in advance. The last time a traveled i did manage to buy advance tickets.\nWhen I traveled a few weeks ago I checked a day before if any advance tickets were available only to be told there were none. When this train arrived the first class had 3 other passengers. When I got off there were zero passengers in my 1st class carriage. But there arent any seats available are there!!\nThis is just one example of the bizarre business practices at XC.\nWhat is going on with them? Why are they telling passengers there are no seats available when the reality is that there are plenty of seats available. Why can't I book advance fares on trains in virtually empty 1st class carriages?\nPlease don't believe XC assertions that they have a shortage of rolling stock for at present XC are refusing to run their fleet of HST(class 254) trains.These trains are currently rotting away in sidings. I have seen some of them at Neville Hill Leeds depot. At least 8 diagrams have been withdrawn for no reason. XC have replaced 7 carriage HST with 4 carriage Voyagers, thus reducing availability of seats etc. In 1st class there has been a reduction of around 66% of seats. On occasion they do operate the odd HST service. I check this on realtimetrains. Why are these trains rotting in sidings when they are clearly fully operational.\nIt has become a total nightmare to book tickets with XC. Please don't let them blame covid for this as its just not true.\nXC are telling passengers there are zero seats available when there are plenty of empty seats in reality.\nThey appear to be going out of their way to stop people traveling. And its working.\nI cannot begin to fathom their logic and peculiar business practices.\nEvery other operator has resumed a full timetable apart from XC. Their hourly Newcastle to Reading Service(via Doncaster) has been discontinued. Only 2 trains per day now run from Newcastle to Birmingham via Doncaster instead of 1 train every hour. Oh yes theres no rolling stock. None apart from those rotting in sidings.\nI am traveling today, but not on my chosen service as zero advance seats were once again available. That means the service is either sold out or they dont want passengers traveling. My chosen return service has had zero seats available every time I have traveled since November 2021\nCross country are an absolute disgrace. They seem to be going out of their way in stopping people from traveling. \nThats the one thing they are very good at.\nIn the absence of a proper independent government ombudsman, XC can get away with all of this with complete impunity. \nIts time something was done about them!!",

I could go on and on about not be able to get refreshments, not being able to use toilets as people travelling in them, not easy on a 5hour journey people sat in luggage racks and bike storage. I did not think something like this could happen especially with COVID restrictions \nWe had booked seats but could not get to them for first part of journey when we did we found they had been double booked.\nWe are an elderly couple, we did not see any staff.\nI would like to say a thank you to the young person  who gave up a seat for me.\nIf we have not contracted COVID it will be a miracle.",

I did, she told me I\u2019d be refunded within a few days. Never was (surprise surprise), then messaged again on FB saying I was still waiting (gave them a good two weeks just in case), the case was then raised with another team over email, they got back to me finally after a couple of weeks, said they\u2019d processed the refund after a lot of needless interaction. I think \u201cgreat!\u201d At least the 46 hours I spent communicating with this company wasn\u2019t all for nothing. I then checked my bank to see the refund, turns out they\u2019ve only refunded me \u00a33.10 (wow) of the \u00a311.40 they owe me (the amount I\u2019d recounted countless times on the phone and over email). Still waiting for this money after having emailed them about 10 times. \nShameful.

My friend, pinned against the train wall all the way,  suffered an angina attack and was very unwell on finally getting off this utter nightmare of a journey. \nTheir response to my reporting this had caused potentially serious and life threatening illness, 3 weeks after emailing a complaint, was to say sorry about the 'uncomfortable' journey and I may be eligible for a small reduction off another rail journey.\nI'm totally disgusted.",

Train staff did not police it even though message throughout journeys said masks must be worn unless exempt. Train back was very disorganised, it arrived on time but the coach numbers were changed while we waited to get on board so there was a mad dash to go to the altered coaches to take up our reserved seats. Such a mix up as people were getting in the wrong coaches and trying to take the seats we were rightly sitting on.  Won't be in a hurry to travel on cross country trains again any time soon. Staff should be telling people to wear face masks at all times. When staff were walking through the carriages taking orders wearing their masks, they should have been reminding passengers to do the same.",

It\u2019s been like this for as long as I can remember and the company has displayed an almost arrogant unwillingness to improve. Woe betide you if you have to take one of their services, which considering they have several busy train routes monopolised under this country\u2019s pitiful railway system, is all but a certainty. Just awful. Look at GWR at take notes, Cross Country, and either improve your services or cede them (and your staff) to a train company who actually care about delivering them well.",

        "review_text": "Unfortunately our initial train was cancelled and we were advised to board a CrossCountry train. This happened in the May bank holiday. If I knew the result of this experience I would have taken a later train! So we were stopped at a station called march, close to Peterborough, because a train further down the line broke down. We were sat there for some 3h waiting for the line to be cleared. Needless to say when we finally moved on we had missed all of the remaining connecting trains and eventually to get to our destination we had to take a taxi. Very unpleasant, but it happens. Following this, we contacted the company, sending all of the information and our tickets for a refund. It has been 2 months and all we hear from them are lame excuses saying that it's not their responsibility because our original train had been cancelled, and that they are putting us into contact with the other company but the email they give us does not work and so far we haven't heard from the other company. Basically they are trying to avoid paying a \u00a340 compensation. Avoid.",

        "review_text": "Nothing first class about this company.\n\nMy 83 year old mother travelled with Cross Country trains from Aberdeen to Chesterfield last Sunday.  We had paid for her to travel first class, on a weekend service with no changes to ensure that she had as stress free and comfortable a journey as possible.\n\nShe travelled 7 hours, and was only offered a cup of tea and a packet of crisps to eat.  There was no food available on the train.  Toilets were described by her as 'unsavoury'.  She came off the train absolutely ravenous and upset by the whole experience.  I wonder, what did we pay the extra for??\n\nTo make matters worse, speaking to the customer care team was awful.  Clearly Kelly had been trained to give the corporate response, that the service was 'as advertised'.  If it was advertised, it certainly wasn't easy for me to find, as I had looked prior to travel.  there was no apology, no recognition of the discomfort and distress experienced by my elderly mother.  I asked if she would have been happy for this to be the experience of her own mother and she declined to answer.  I asked her to give me a human rather than corporate response and she would not.  I did not feel heard.\n\nThe money is one thing, I have no idea how the company can justify the expense of the ticket operating as it was on a minimal service, but the customer care was the thing that took the biscuit.  I was left feeling that the company couldn't care less, and that nothing would be taken from my complaint.\n  I will await the corporate response, and if it arrives, as I expect it will, will be going straight to the railway ombudsman.",

        "review_text": "We have several times travelled on Crosscountry from the Southwest to Derby and the experience has almost always been dreadful.  Generally the staff are friendly and try to be helpful but the poor facilities, crowding and condition of the carriages are bad.  On a recent journey we decided to 'treat' ourselves to a first class fare, thinking that maybe the crowding would be less and we would get some decent refreshments - as would be the case with some other operating companies.  As often happens, the train was a short formation and many passengers had to stand in the aisles and in between carriages, also in first class.  It was bedlam, with Covid recommendations impossible to observe.  The first class catering was pathetic - still water, tea/coffee and biscuits - that's it.  Eventually crisps were available, about 2.5 hours into the journey. The seats and carpets are worse than standard class on other trains. The toilet by first class was out of order and so was another on the train. The train did arrive on time - but that is the only good thing that can be said about the journey.  Lessons: Crosscountry is dire, with crowded trains (why so often short formations?); travelling first class (which is expensive compared to some other companies) is a total rip-off and should be avoided; their captive market for some journeys, with no competition, might be good for the shareholders but it seems to encourage shameful indifference to the comfort of passengers, despite the high ticket costs.  I do hope that they lose the franchise.",

        "review_text": "A few months ago I was travelling home from work (that could not be done from home) and a CrossCountry employee announced over the tannoy that only KEY workers, in possession of written documentation proving their key-ness, would be permitted to travel and that we would be required to present this as they passed through the train. I was terrified of being fined or even arrested, because I thought this actually might be the law and I'd just not noticed it before now. In the event, I hid in the toilets like a stowaway and queried this policy when I got home. It turns out, the policy is total nonsense, no such legal requirement exists or ever has, and I was wrong to believe the announcer. Everyone I spoke to at CrossCountry about this problem lied and lied and lied. They flatly denied that anyone had said anything of the sort, then they told me it was a BTP policy (it isn't, as I checked), then they told me it was the government guidelines (it isn't, as I checked), then they told me that statements made by CrossCountry employees were not CrossCountry's responsibility... and at no point did anyone ever offer me the ghost of an apology for having lied to an entire train full of people about what is, and is not, the law. Shameful.",

I had booked tickets for a birthday surprise (hadn't reserved seats as it was only a short 30 minute journey). We sat in a carriage, followed social distancing and well away from any other passenger, the seat wasn't booked. Numerous people also got into this carriage, which wasn't first class, and sat down. We were seated for all but 30 seconds, the train hasn't even left the station, before a conductor marched her way over to us and demanded whether we had the right ticket. I explained that yes I had booked tickets to which she again repeated her question, in a quite patronising manner. It was at this point that my partner realised she was asking whether we had reserved these exact seats. I said no but this seat isn't booked (as the display above said so). The conductor then told us that we would have to leave this carriage and go find seats elsewhere, resulting in us having to walk through multiple carriages (which isn't ideal considering covid). I was mortified and had to embarrassing walk passed all the other passengers carrying suitcases. The unusual thing about this experience was that she specifically came straight to us, despite being in the middle of the carriage. I felt singled out based on our appearances even though we were following all the usual measures and being a paying customer. I suppose the lesson is to book a specific seat but regardless this experience ruined my weekend and I wouldn't use this service again.",

They actually made me sit closer to the other passengers, breaking the social distancing rules.\nWhen I expressed my opinion about ridiculousness of the situation to the train manager, he said, that if I find it ridiculous I shouldn\u2019t be using a public transport and I can feel free to jump off the train at the nearest station. He acted like he was deliberately trying to provoke a conflict. I wasn\u2019t aggressive of offensive in any way, so I don\u2019t think I deserved to be treated like a yob, like the Cross Country staff was doing me a favour letting me using their service. The train manager was extremely rude and offensive and I never experienced this kind of behaviour before. Very disappointing.",

All other trains I had booked with other train services for the same week gave me a full refund apart from Cross Country Trains who refused. They said that I should book new tickets which have to be from the same train station that I had previously booked from and the ticket price needed to be the same or higher and that this would be my 'refund'. That is not a refund, that's just poor customer service. It shows a willingness to allow people to travel who shouldn't be, putting others in danger.

Not even water, we had a 4 hour 45min trip with nothing!\nCustomer service not interested and do not accept they have a duty of care to their customers. Having, at very least, water should be available, especially for passengers travelling such a distance. There is now a limited service available but on our return this was available at the other end of the train from 1st class.\nWe have been offered \u00a330 in vouchers, against a \u00a3235 each ticket (\u00a3470 total). Told them it was an insult but not interested, a bit like the rude staff on the train.\nWill never travel with them again.",

I was waiting for more than 1 hour 15 min for talking with a customer care representative and after that time, one lady(Ms Churni Khasnobis) picked up the call.\n\nI have two points: 1. I have requested for a partial cancellation on 05 Mar to my booking from Leicester to Chesterfield which was planned on 06 Mar over a telephone. The representative confirmed my cancellation. Even after so many days they haven't processed my refund. I came to know today that the payment was rejected as I have activated my ticket before cancelling it. \n\nAs far I know in UK you can't activate a ticket before the travel day. So I think technically it is not possible. Finally after lot of discussion she has connected me to her manager who has verbally confirmed me that she will be reprocessing my cancellation. I am not sure what will happen next.\n\nPoint 2: I had to request cancelling my current season ticket for rest of the days as my Office is not allowing working from office anymore due to current situation. The number I dialled as I have received with my season ticket booking from Cross country. Now she has provided me with another no: 03445561344 and told me that this is the number for season ticket department. The question here is if they are not suppose to answer for season tickets then why a other department numbers were given for contacting further on season ticket and harassing and wasting customers time?\n\nDo you think that after waiting for more than 1 and half hour, you will l just answer with a alternative phone number and will say \"sorry for the inconvenience caused\" is sufficient for the customer?\n\nI am highly dissatisfied with cross-country and will definitely not going to use it for any of my future bookings.",

I've had to complete journey info 12 times, log in more that 6 times and retry in access of 40 times. \n\nI was charged twice for one journey when the app wouldn't download my ticket. Officious staff at New Street failed to provide me with a ticket even though I had proof of purchase and the download failure was not my fault. Customer Service have refused to refund and compensate me quoting 'policy' (ignoring their duty in law and as per the Customer Charter!!!). I've spent hours on this and have been really inconvenienced (I missed my connecting  train due to being marched off to buy a second ticket!). \n\nI'm disgusted with my experience:officious staff, and especially 'Customer Service' (that's a laugh!!) who are appalling. This is how this company value a frequent traveller!",

The tickets have gotten more expensive and the crowding has got worse.\n\nWhy oh why does the team who plan the Rolling stock allocations think that a 2 carriage Turbo star is acceptable on the rush hour services from Birmingham to Cardiff. Surely the volume of seat reservations on the service is an indication of use. \n\nIt is no longer acceptable. I have seen 1980s and 2000s rolling stock attached together to form longer trains for west Midlands trains, so why not do similar for cross country rush hour trains. You could couple them up at New street, then couple them at Gloucester. Is that really so difficult to do? Or is it simply about the money. If it is. The cross country execs should receive no bonus and should be held responsible. It's an embarrassment for UK railways.",

We started the first part of our journey with GWR who both know how to operate trains (doubling the 5 carriages at Plymouth to accommodate the numbers of travellers) and look after their customers giving a great standard of service on the train. I haven\u2019t seen a single member of cross country staff today. Mind you not surprising as they can\u2019t make it through due to everyone standing. 4 coaches with half as many seats as GWR trains and to top that the last coach is first class with no one in it. \nYou need to review your operating model, it doesn\u2019t work for your customers, you know the ones that pay your wages and keep your business afloat. \nI would highly recommend that people avoid using your service. It\u2019s not fit for purpose. \nI won\u2019t be using Cross Country again and will make sure I tell  everyone else.",

        "review_text": "Many of the franchised rail services are poor, but Arriva owned Cross Country just HAS to be the worst.\n\nTravelled Southampton to Birmingham yesterday. The train was announced (and used to be) a five carriage unit but, to maximise profits at expense of passengers, Cross Country have reduced all to four car units, taking out the unreserved seating car. \n\nReserving a seat makes no difference as, for more than one sector of the journey, three passengers had tickets with same seat allocated.\n\nSo I had to stand (along with many other passengers) for all but short sectors when an unreserved seat became available - continual 'musical chairs' but without the music. No sign of the guard, who was hiding from passengers' frustration. \n\nThe return journey was worse, because the previous service had been cancelled. In front of the waiting passengers, our train passed a red light, at New Street, to pull to the wrong end of the platform, which meant that there was a high-speed complete crush of two trains-worth of waiting passengers to get to the train. Very dangerous! No announcements for this or any of the other delays or discomforts. \n\nFellow regularly suffering passengers have complained but get stupid responses from Cross Country's people (probably a call centre in India): \"Our metrics show that these trains are under used, do we have taken a carriage out\"; \"The Government won't let us run five car trains anymore\"; etc.  Clearly as rubbish as their trains and so-called service.\n\nDreadful, dreadful, dreadfully. Drive your car: its cheaper, more comfortable and you'll get to your destination when you want to.",

        "review_text": "Cross Country trains are 1 of 3 companies that supply trains to and from my local town. When you get on there is only a 50% chance you will get a seat at any time of day due to the amount of people that use the service which runs every 30-60 mins. Sometimes it is standing room only and you are unable to move more than a few inches without banging into a stranger.\nSome of the carriages also have bins that are dirty/smelly or that aren't fully secure while I get that this cant always be checked during the day it should be cleaned/emptied at least 2 times a day if there is always a lot of people using the trains.\nSome of the conductors can also come across as confrontational whether they mean to or not without naming and shaming I recently travelled on a cross country train and tried to buy a ticket from my local station to see that no one was in the ticket office this meant I had to use the machine and being unable to find the railcard option I decided to buy my ticket on the train. When the conductor came round I tried to explain the situation where his response was there's a machine at the station and you have to get a ticket before you get on which is what I was fully aware of. He then started to get confrontational and starting talking to me like I was a criminal even though I would've happily paid for a ticket and saying I couldn't have my discount which I have never been told before when I've brought a ticket on a train. I later found out the reason was so he could get more commission from me buying a ticket from him which is unfair to anyone who pays for a yearly railcard as they are entitled to a discount both on and off trains.\nWouldn't say this is the best company to use from my mixed experience even though they have been fairly quick to give me a refund for a delayed train when I have tried to claim part of my money back.",

        "review_text": "I had purchased several months in advance 2 return adult tickets for a journey to Edinburgh and back from my hometown as we were attending an event. A week or so before the trip I received an email stating that due to engineering works, coupled with industrial action there would be a disruption to services and some cancelled trains. On the day of the outbound trip the train that I had tickets for did actually run, however, due to the volume of passengers already on board by the time it reached my station we were refused entry due to overcrowding and safety concerns, we were informed by station staff that we could get the next due train albeit a longer journey,  however, this train was also full and we were refused entry. We then were told that the only other option left to us was to use another rail company ScotRail and pay for tickets at a much higher cost! The Crosscountry Train official website stated that we could indeed use our tickets with ScotRail as an alternative but this clearly was incorrect as we were told by 3 different staff members that the tickets already purchased would definitely be refused and our only option was to purchase new much more expensive ones, because we had to attend an event I had no other option to buy these tickets and we only made the event by the skin of our teeth! The exact same thing happened the following day with our return trip again I had to purchase much more expensive tickets just to get back home. I understand that engineering works and strike action may not be the company's fault but they do however have a duty of care to their customers. When I called the so called customer service line the person I spoke with was not interested in what I was trying to explain to him about the information being clearly misleading and wrong, the organisation was horrendous and customers treated with contempt! I will never use this company again.",

But forget that - I DM'd and emailed XC and they were very apologetic that the First Class experience didn't meet my expectations. So no reason to be frustrated - they didn't have the greatest day 2 days before. Plus my ticket was only nearly \u00a315 with my railcard and I got a seat.\n\nSince August 2017, I've had extremely reliable journeys with XC (my local station for XC services is Oxford) - the Voyagers have been virtually on time / no more than around say 5 minutes late, reliable seat reservations and a good trolley service. Plus I always choose the Newcastle services where possible as these are normally great for seat availability. The 14:13 on weekdays (or 14:09 if retimed) is my favourite Oxford to Birmingham New Street train for seat availability, put it that way!\n\nTurning to the HST's again - if for any reason you can't afford First Class fares for the CrossCountry HST services then make sure you book a seat in the Quiet Coach! I did this for the 16:03 from Birmingham New Street to Leeds on the 04/04/19 - if you don't want look at a carriage full of passengers, go for seat 5 in Coach G as you're at the Guards Van end of the passenger area facing  the door to it. The window table seat facing it, number 3, is a useful one as you don't need to constantly turn round to see if anyone's coming towards you.\n\nThere's 'Quiet Zone' stickers on I think nearly (or) all windows. You'll find the rules are respected.\n\nIf you're an HST fan like me, then do the Quiet Coach if you can't afford First Class!",

I have been emailing Nomad (the company responsible for WiFi on Cross Country trains) for the last two hours using 4G on my phone, and they seem incapable of getting the WiFi back on. They've also asked some truly idiotic questions - replying to an email listing my arrival and departure stations by asking for my arrival and departure stations, for instance.\n\nFor someone like me who is reliant on WiFi to work while they travel, this represents a fairly major issue. I've never travelled with this company before, and I won't be in a hurry to do so again.",

I had purchased a 1st class ticket from Darlington to Aberdeen with LNER yesterday but was informed of substantial delays or possible cancellation by LNER due to line problems near Peterborough and advised I could use Cross Country to complete my journey instead as all ticket restrictions had been lifted because of the circumstances.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I boarded the train I was informed that hot/cold food would be served after Newcastle. However when the food trolley staff arrived I was then informed that Cross Country were not providing food to LNER passengers!! Despite the fact that her trolley was well stocked!\u00a0\n\n\nI was then left with absolutely no choice but to purchase supplies for my near 6 hour journey from the catering carriage! I was a sitting duck with no other option! At no time prior to boarding the train was I informed that the catering component of my LNER 1st class ticket would not be honoured! Had I been made aware of this prior to boarding I would have been in a position to make an informed choice as to whether to board the train!\n\n\nThank goodness I had the means to pay for supplies otherwise i would have faced a 6 hour journey without! Thankfully I do not have any serious health problems ie diabetes otherwise the train would have been forced to stop and suffer delays because of a medical emergency! Thank goodness I did not have any small children with me faced with a hungry 6 hour journey! \n\nI am a frequent train traveller and having been subject to this appalling customer service yesterday I advise others to avoid ever purchasing tickets with this company, who in my experience are devoid of the human factor favouring strict profit margins rather than assisting customers in need!\u00a0\n\n\nAppalling! Avoid using this train operator at all costs!",

Only train company I've used that has reserved seating outside of 1st class, but other companies manage to avoid this and still have plenty of seating most of the time. These trains are usually overloaded, even on journeys that don't have that many people. Perhaps one day the company bosses will invest some money in extra carriages instead of extra pay for themselves, but I doubt it. Other countries manage to have perfectly serviceable nationalised railways, why is it we always have to come up with excuses? Probably because some of that extra pay goes into the pockets of politicians and media moguls.",

We have paid for the tickets \u00a3200 and we expected to at least have the luxury of getting on the actual train, which of course did not happen! We waited 1 hour for the next one (1 hour for which we felt lucky as we might have had the possibility of actaully not having another train). We have indeed managed to get ourselves in the next train and we received the compensation of having to sit on no seat what so ever for 3 hours!!!! This is beyond normal, and I should have expected to at least have where to sit for 3 hours ride! Since when a train has the option of standing on your feet for a ride??",

        "review_text": "I am a fairly frquent traveller on Virgin, East Midlands, London North Western, GWR and Cross country. Cross Country by some way are the worst, mainly due to overcrowding.  Their franchise documents promise a great deal - more trains and carriages.  Too bad they never deliver.  I used to travel trouble free on London Midland yet they had the franchise taken off them.  If I'm waiting for a Cross Country train I always look in envy at those on a Virgin train.  The former operate 4 carriages (one of which is first class) whilst the latter offer 9 or 11.  On the odd occasion that Virgin 2nd class is full I have been allowed to move to First Class.  Must check when Cross Country's franchise is due for renewal to see what they're promising with no intention of delivering!!  To add insult to injury CrossCountry even have the cheek to charge you for postal delivery of ticket AND unbelievably also charge for collection from a ticket machine.  I therefore buy my Cross Country tickets, when I have no choice but to travel with them, from Transpennine who do not charge either for postal or ticket machine collection.",

I was offered a cup of lukewarm coffee in a cardboard cup but had to ask about food which they advertise as serving. I was eventually reluctantly offered a packet of crisps.

The rest of the train was full so I didn't want to fight my way through drunken football fans so waited for the table service. \n\nNobody came, and then 5 mins before I was due to get off the train someone came and offered me a cup of tea - how nice. I was so glad I paid the extra for 3.5 hours of nothing and then a cup of tea I'd have to down like a shot of Tequila. \n\nWhen I complained, I was then informed that none of the services that I paid for were guaranteed and all were subject to availability. \n\nThey also said that I should have gone to the train manager to ask for my complimentary food and drinks, thus then blaming me for not receiving the service I paid them to provide while moaning about short staffing as if I had done the rota for them.\n\nBasically, you can take an old Virgin Train and keep the first class badges on them as much as you want, but if you don't care about the customers who pay you the service will always be abysmal.",

My train was delay by 27 minutes and I did a breakdown to the two people I spoke to.  In other words they don't know how to add up ie if it takes 10min from Maccelsfield to stockport and then 10min to Manchester in total that is 27min. The attendant on the train said that the train was delayed my 30min and that you can claim a refund. That is totally a lie because they refuse to give you a refund. The two people in which I spoke to was Rav and Prianca they had no clue what they was talking about and there customer service skills were below average. They make money out of the general public and vulnerable people and refuse to give them a full refund, I think CROSS COUNTRY TRAINS should be ashamed of themselves in what they are doing to people.  If they was the last train company on earth I definitely would not use them. They have no sympathy to there clients whatsoever and treat them like scum.",

        "review_text": "Did a return to Birmingham New Street from Reading on the weekend of the 23rd/24th November. My tickets were booked through the Trainline App.\nUpon getting on at Reading, it was quickly apparent that even though The Trainline said I had a reserved seat, there were no actual reservations on the train itself. This lead to a free for all and some raised voices and arguments amongst passengers. It was also quickly apparent that there were way more passengers than coaches; there were only 4 coaches and there were about a dozen or more passengers standing in each carriage. At each stop after Reading, the amount of Passengers getting onto the train far exceeded the amount getting off. When we arrived at Birmingham, it was fair to say the Train was rammed.\nSadly, it was more or less the same scenario on the return journey on the Sunday, but I will add that both journeys were more or less on time and the trains had ticket guards, who were pretty good dealing with the customers. They were probably used to the situation. \nSo going forward, the answer to the problem is pretty simple, put on 1 or 2 more coaches per train.\nAnd lastly, YOU DO NOT CHARGE FOR THE INTERNET IN 2018. Lots of signs everywhere saying there is wifi, only to try and log in and find out they charge. What an utter p*** take.",

We said OK we'll have those, then!\nThen it was 'I can't serve you alcohol'. Ok, so we walked the length of the train twice but couldn't find the trolley man. I wanted something to celebrate some good news, but I gave up as it was just too much hassle!\n\nOh, and the train carriage  was cold...i discovered the window on the top part of the nearest door was open... as an aside i was amused to see it was an old train where you need to put your hand out to the handle to open the door ..:)",

Quite possibly the rudest and most unhelpful person I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He couldn\u2019t care less that there was a young child sat outside the toilets. Chris even said that passengers are not his responsibility, unbelievable.!!\nI have emailed a formal complaint to CEO Andy Cooper, and had no response from him or the company.

I Was inclined to give the company a one star rating based on my experience today, however that would not be a representative rating of my overall experience. I\u2019ve had my fair share of delays with them, but I\u2019ve also had a lot of delays with other companies. I find it weird that in 2018 you are still expected to pay for WiFi on a train, but other companies charge, too. What I however don\u2019t understand at all is their system of making you take the train you booked for your advance ticket even if said train is massively late. Both the earlier train and my train were so late, I could have easily taken the earlier train, making me a Happy customer arriving slightly ahead of scheduled time. Instead I was told I would have to wait another hour for my delayed booked train to arrive, making me a very late unhappy customer eligable for a refund. I have travelled several countries by train and crosscountry Is the only train company I\u2019ve come across that doesn\u2019t seem to understand that if you are not delivering your promise (aka arriving at the planned stop at the planned time)   Good customer service can really smooth things over with your unhappy customers. Delays happen and can\u2019t always be prevented, bad customer service however is a choice.",

        "review_text": "Terrible experience trying to return ticket. Followed instructions given over the phone on how to return tickets. Sent via royal mail special delivery at own cost with a hand typed cover letter (yes believe it or not this is the process apparently). Tickets arrived 14/6 for which I have proof. 3 phone calls later, each time having to explain the whole thing again, and 4 weeks later I still haven't received a refund. Each time I call I am promised that the refund is being processed, with the excuse that some error has been made somewhere along the way. \n\nThis is 2018. There is absolutely no excuse for a large company such as Crosscountry to not have a robust and automated returns procedure and to be instead forcing customers to write letters - with no means of tracking the refund process. In addition, it seems there is no cohesion in dealing with complains and no process or system in place to track and progress problems or complains with customer experiences.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS.",

I normally travel with Virgin and the service is reliable. \n\nFirstly it was an hour before anyone arrived with the trolley ie 13.45.   By now most of the carriage was grumbling and hungry.  We hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast at 7.30 am.  \n\nThere was NO FOOD. We were offered biscuits or a piece of fruit cake.  When a passenger complained that more was promised on the leaflet she was reading, she was told rudely to \u2018read the small print\u2019.  However we were willing to buy food but that wasn\u2019t an option either.  There was no food. \n\nSome passengers were travelling on to Bristol and an elderly couple, one a type 2 diabetic, were travelling to Penzance on this train; a journey of 8+ hours. \n\nMy advice ...travel standard class, take your own food or better still use a better train company.\n\nOh...and don\u2019t bother complaining you won\u2019t even get a response.

I sent the ticket  (luckily) by recorded delivery. After 2 weeks again no sign of refund. Upon contact they denied to receive any ticket but when i chased up the recorded delivery reference they admitted they had recieved it the next day i sent the ticket. Again promised will get my refund next day but it has been 3 days and still no sign at all!!\nReally disappointed with their service! And they have lost another loyal customer!",

I contacted their call centre in India, the call handler couldn't understand a word I said nor I him.

It was almost double the price to book from Doncaster to Birmingham international so I booked this instead as it was the same train (which just shows how they manipulate prices from busier destinations). This train was cancelled on very little notice, maybe 5-10 minutes at the most. I was forced to book a taxi to reach the airport in time for my flight. I then sent an email to there team which took well over 2 weeks to get a response. I was told I was not eligible to claim any expenses on the taxi I had to pay for and also I had to post my ticket back for the train that never even departed to get my money back. I told them why do I need to do this, clearly their system should automatically credit customers their money back for cancelled journeys, instead of wasting their time in the hope they will not send the ticket back. Will defiantly avoid them in the future.",

The price of the ticket was truly extortionate but we felt we had put him in a position of safety.  On the day, due to industrial action which we were not notified of, he ended up being shunted from train to train making a total of four changes and never actually reaching his final destination as we picked up a station before to save him the stress of yet another change.  He was almost three hours late on the original arrival schedule and Cross Country are refusing to refund the cost of the ticket because he neglected to keep track of what times he got onto the various trains he was forced to use.  He was just intent on getting home in one piece. Taking notes of times was not part of his plan for the day, he just went where he was told to go in a state of confusion and panic that robbed him of his dignity.  The lack of humanity and decency displayed by Cross Country trains is abhorrent.  Don't use them.",

Scrum to get on.  Old small seats so packed up against other people with nowhere to put a suitcase.   Had to upgrade (at my own not employer expense) to first class just to get a seat.  Too few carriages resulting in appalling inhumane overcrowding.  People pressed against the glass like flies, and sitting/standing in every available inch of toilets, carriages and corridors.  Surprisingly little abuse from  passengers - in France there'd be riots if people were treated this badly.  Grotty trolley clatters eventually through in first class and had to pay for 'dinner' in the form of the measly overpriced cheese & pickle sandwich, crisps and warm wine or warm beer.  (Eventually cracked and now travel from Slough to Paddington across London to get to Euston for a 'proper' Virgin train home.  Not much better but less stressful).   Typical CrossCountry first class booked online in advance ticket price: around \u00a3250 return.  Shocker.  Avoid.",

The train managers have even started to make jokes about the trolley Not being able to get through, yet none of them seem to have the ambition to do anything about it.

        "review_text": "I recently bought a print at home ticket over the telephone and on opening the PDF ticket I noticed that my name was misspelled. The ticket clearly states that ID must be presented with it in order for it to be valid and consequently I contacted their customer service team who explained that they were unable to amend the mistake and that the situation now needed to be investigated before a refund could be issued. I was advised to buy another ticket to allow me to travel and I followed this advice.\n\nI continued to follow up this problem with their customer services department who acknowledged that the mistake was theirs and that I was wrongly advised to buy another ticket, (instead I should have been issued a permit to travel which would have allowed me to travel on the original ticket)\n\nCross Country Trains were unable to refund me as they claimed that proof of purchase for the extra ticket was required to do so, despite the situation being a mistake on the original ticket which caused it to be invalid. I had no such proof of purchase as the extra ticket was not returned when used at the ticket barrier at my destination station.\n\nI continued to dispute this situation and was offered only travel vouchers as compensation but, not likely to be travelling by Cross Country Trains in the near future, I continued to seek a full refund. This was never offered and I gave up on the situation approximately \u00a352 out of pocket.\n\nCross Country's response was certainly unreasonable. They agreed that the mistakes that led to the expense were theirs and that a refund was not immediately issued for the invalid ticket is baffling. It is regrettable that I did not have the original ticket but this was no fault of my own and in any case is irrelevant as the situation was entirely a problem with the unusable original ticket. \n\nAll in all, it is very disappointing that such a well established company is not prepared to immediately refund its customers for mistakes that they make.",

They have made it exceptionally awkward to use, having to book on the phone nearly 3 weeks before intended date of travel or go into a train station in person....I'll have paid out what I'm set to save in city centre parking charges before I even get my tickets. It's 2016, maybe Cross Country should look into dragging themselves in the digital age.",
