It is the appalling communication (or should I say, completely lacking of communication) that is most annoying. What harm would that be to put a sign notifying people they skip a stop?\n\nJust a piece of paper isn't it? Considering the incident was reported yesterday and it has been more than 24 hours and nothing has been communicated. This explains operation of this company is an utter shxt show.",

Network invariably down...machine takes you in a loop so you give up and join the queue with 50 others....and you need to be 4ft tall to read card machine. Cancellations and points failures now a weekly feature.",

The ticket machines often don't work very well and there's only ever one member of staff in the ticket booth and they're always really slow. This isn't my experience today, or yesterday, or last week. This is my experience every time, consistently, entering Westcliff station is like entering a dream state, like being trapped in a crystal by the Goblin King, where all time is forgotten.\n\nI was there once and, as usual, there was a queue to get a ticket. But it was because three members of staff were all talking to this one person about his enquiry, a great use of everybody's time. It took them ten minutes and I missed two trains.",

I think it is an uncomplicated simple 1 hour journey to Shoeburyness and meets up with Greater Anglia twice being London Liverpool Street and Southend Victoria as a short walk away from Southend Central.\nI like the space on their trains, the class 357, and has room for a lot of capacity. Unfortunately not a lot of people tend to use this railway which upsets me as it seems like a nice and quick ride to the Eastern seaside. I also do like the pink theme onboard these trains and I wish the Liverpool Street and Stratford routes were used more often.",

The helpline is an outside agency who work on behalf of c2c but do not have the power to issue refunds.I have asked every one of the people I have called to escalate my issue which was not resolved and eventually after wasting hours of my time I had had  enough and asked for compensation for the lack of customer service expected from c2c and asked for a finacial goodwill gesture for the distress and upset caused. I was eventually offered my refund but c2c did not acknowledge my complaint and I explained this in my response to them. I have still not had my refund and called c2c again last week to discuss this but to no avail.I understand this is over the Christmas break but this really does not excuse  poor customer service. One of the customer service agents was named Nazia and the delays in her responses to my emails is poor and very distressing and frustrating. Hopefully a  c2c representative might see this review and  action my complaint.\n\u00a3130.20 might not be a lot of money to some people but it is needed in the week before Christmas!!",

The problem here is that it still takes the money from your account (marked as Pending by your bank, but it 'locks' this amount from your account) and you have NO WAY of contacting any sort of online support, every single links redirect to the 'Contact us' form for train complaints. I'm still trying to get back my money after trying to buy my tickets 3 times (and yup, it failed 3 times at different time intervals).\n- The 'cashback' based on points NEVER works, meaning you win points when you buy tickets, and then... well you cannot use them to reduce the price of future purchase. There is a way to retrieve this value in cash (cheque actually) but you must have at least \u00a35 worth of cashback, so at the end the year, it RESETS meaning you can lose \u00a34.99. What's the point of this if you just cannot use it?",

        "review_text": "If I could rate 'em nuffin' I would.  An incident happened on 27th November 2023 or the week beginning Monday 4th December 2023 in Barking Station.  It was handled badly by c2c staff.  A complaint was emailed to TFL because I thought they operated that train station.  TFL replied in late December 2023 or January 2024 that they don't operate Barking Station and that I should contact c2c.  So, on Friday 5th January 2024 I emailed c2c regarding the incident.  They said I'd get a reply in 20 working days. 20 working days was up on Friday 2nd February 2023.  So, I called and spoke to a lovely lady who took my case reference number and said someone would be in contact with me soon.\nI heard nothing, nada, zilch from c2c, so I phoned customer service again and spoke to she same nice lady who took my customer reference number and said she'd pass it on and that someone would be contacting me soon, and - yep, you guessed it, I've heard diddly squat from 'em!\n\nThey're a privately owned company with an MD.  This lots trading name is Trentalia c2c Ltd and apparently they operate the transport system in Italy.  What are the chances that the directors will be ignored when they wanna get paid the financial rewards of their investments?\n\nI mean c2c customer service doesn't exist.  They got the same woman answering calls with the same stock reply.  Every time I call c2c and I've called on 3 different occasions, I speak to the same lady.  And she told me she works weekends too.  They're deliberately understaffing customer service so they can maximise their profits.  That's what this lot are doing.  And, I don't begrudge directors of a privately owned company wanting to make a profit.  But what I can't stand is when they're making money and not offering people excellent customer service.  An' I ain't 'aving it.  I am going to get reply from them even if I have to write to the Managing Director himself.",

I was taken back to the previous page so I entered my card details and payed again and once again I was returned back a page without receiving an email confirmation of the ticket dispensing code. Without which I am unable to collect the tickets at the ticket machine. I checked my bank account and sure enough the money was taken from my account - twice. I have just requested a refund but was required to provide a screenshot of the confirmation email I never received and not only that bit it will apparently take the 28 days, a whole month just to process the refund. I'm guessing I have to buy the ticket a third time in person later today because I have work to get to and can't sit around for a month for a refund I'll probably be robbed off. At this rate I'm just considering moving to London. I can't be asked to deal with a new problem every few weeks with this incompetent rail service.",

I have sent two e-mails in the last 2 months chasing up its whereabouts and not received any response.\n\nWhen i telephone customer services they advise there is nothing they can do to help and i just have to wait for the refunds team to contact me. They wont even confirm they have received my refund application that i handed in to  my local station.\n\nA week ago i received an e-mail advising my refund will be received on 29th May. I still have not received it and am owed over \u00a33k.\n\nI Appreciate under the current circumstances the process might take longer then normal but after 2 months of waiting, not one e-mail responded to and a refusal of anyone in customer services to help I think is an absolute disgrace.",

        "review_text": "I had a very poor experience with c2c last year when I was sold a ticket to a station that was inaccessible due to engineering works and was effectively abandoned with no money in my pocket, in an unfamiliar part of London. I am disabled and this turn of events caused me tremendous problems. During the journey I witnessed, on a number of occasions, the disdain of the staff on duty for customers, treating them with indifference and being openly rude about them after they were gone. It was genuinely shocking.\n\nThe complaint department demonstrated a marked insensitivity towards my disabled status which is worrying. \n\nThe Ombudsman negotiated compensation where I would receive a \u00a320 rail voucher and the fare for my journey would be reimbursed.\n\nI received the voucher. The fare for the journey was never returned to me. \n \nc2c rolling stock is decent quality, but there is something rotten in the heart of this company. The breadth of the failures I witnessed can only be the result of poor management.",

I couldn\u2019t it was perfect! Since 2015 i hate it, it deteriorated when they changed a perfectly good timetable, which was met with big protests, but they still didn\u2019t listen to their customers and went ahead with the new timetable, and month by month the service got longer and more overcrowded trains! c2c are more concerned about looking after passengers use the service from West Ham and Barking! They have also made this a metro railway, stopping at every stop! If you live between Shoebury and Benfleet expect painfully long journeys as most trains take 50-65mins to Fenchurch St due to the amount of stops! There is only one fast train between 6-9 am, from Shoebury taking 1hr! Which is so poor! Not only are most journeys slow it is incredibly busy (Tuesday to Thursday) seating is limited once you reach Chalkwell, again extremely poor! Monday and Friday are not too bad due to working from home people! Complaining, don\u2019t both they don\u2019t listen and spend most of their time patting themselves on the back proclaiming they provide a brilliant service! The biggest joke was earlier in the year they did a satisfaction survey which scored 99% of pass\u00e9ngers were happy with the service, do you know how many passengers took the service 72! I think the 72 were Friends and family! I\u2019m sorry but 72 people is not enough to do a decent survey!!!! The less I have to use this railway the better, which is a shame as if it was a faster service I would go into London more! But at the moment I can\u2019t wait to do a one day week in the office!",

They were so rude and tried to make me feel at fault saying I should have got to the station earlier and it wasn\u2019t their fault even though I got their 5 minutes before the train and went to the machines and to the security person and then to the desk. However they would not let me through the barriers until after I missed my train and continued to tell me all the things I should have done even though I clearly had a valid ticket on my phone. They also made me show that I had a valid railcard, making me feel like I\u2019d done something wrong even though I'm a regular customer that pays. But I also want to point out that even though they let me through the barriers after the train had gone, the smartcard system still was not working and for some reason they chose to make me miss my train. Clearly they just wanted to make me miserable and feel inferior. Rubbish service and ridiculously overpriced. But I have no choice because I have to get to work and have no other option to get in.",

        "title": "Ticket machines are a scam - no option to complain online",
        "review_text": "It was my first time using this service, having to travel from Limehouse station to Basildon. \n\nI had purchased an online ticket. That was a mistake, as it seemed that I could use my oyster card to enter the train station in Limehouse (when leaving the DLR station, they are connected). In fact, there was no way to collect my pre-bought tickets unless I exited the DLR station, and then enter the C2C station via a separate entrance. Sigh. Fine.\n\nWhen returning from Basildon the same day, I decided to use my oyster / contactless card instead of buying another ticket online, as the ticket collection experience is a nightmare (long queues, you need a purhasing bank card etc). BUT.. apparently the gates didn't support oyster / contactless cards despite seemingly being able to accept so (they had the yellow card reader that every tube station has). Then I had to wait in the queue to buy a ticket from the machine (I would have to wait anyway in order to collect an online ticket, as they don't do QR). When my time to use the machine came, I was quickly presented with about 6-8 options, all RETURN tickets to several places, with several prices. No option to choose a single ticket (not sure if there was another menu, but I genuinely had seconds to buy my ticket as a big number of furious people were waiting behind me to buy / collect their tickets). SO I was forced in essence to buy a return ticket (AMEX wasn't accepted, so i had to repeat the process and use another card which added to the stress). Very bad.\n\nThen the following day I tried to complain online only to get an automated message that I have to go to a C2C STATION (what on earth!!) and collect a complaint form... the whole system seems either like a carefully designed scam or a very VERY lazy business when it comes to customer service. I'd say scam, as the way the ticket machines work is really bad and forces you to spend more money. Unfortunately I'll have to use them again but please DON'T if you absolutely don't have to.\n\n\n\nThe train iself was good, on time, fairly clean and regular.",

I buy my tickets on my phone and they say I have to collect it which is fair enough but last week I was coming back quite late from uni and I had bought the ticket on my phone and then I went to collect it and he gave me a dirty look and was like to me what if I wasn\u2019t here and then I said well then I would show proof that I have bought my ticket to the man and he goes no you can\u2019t do that. Well what other solution would I have? And he was just being so rude for no reason. If that is not a form of evidence why the hell can we buy them online if we are in that situation? \nAlso yesterday my ticket wasn\u2019t working and so the man was letting people through and they had already shown their ticket and he hadn\u2019t spoken to me but when I showed him mine he went \u201cI said go\u201d in quite an aggressive way which was unnecessary and rude yet again.\nThey staff are so rude and there is no understanding. The same issue used to happen to me at Southend central too and the man was so rude to me that he 1 made me cry 2 would not let me through even though I was explaining to him that I got my travel funded and I was showing him proof that I did but there was just a problem with something to do with it that day and he made me separate from my friends on my own in the dark and wanted me to walk all the way around Southend central station in the high street in the dark on my own and I wasn\u2019t even 18 at the time and even a couple members of the public stepped in because they could see how stressed I was getting. There is no understanding and no sympathy. Respect if given where it is showed and with 90% of C2C staff none is shown what so ever.",
