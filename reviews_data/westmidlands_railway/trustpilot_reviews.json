Nor are we getting any replies to our update requests whenever contacting the supervisor who apparently was taking care of the compensation. \n\nCase has now been again escalated to the ombudsman for further review. \n\n\n\n",

Almost 100 quid extra than std for the pair of us for no extra comfort or service. Complete waste of money, condition was grubby and littered.\n0 star",

It's a sorry state of affairs if they are having to find non-payers and additional revenue among regular customers queuing up to pay! Sort of thing you'd expect from a two-bob wheel clamping company.

        "title": "Season Ticket Issue Scam",
        "review_text": "Here's how it works.  West Midlands Trains buy blocks of 'deliveries' from Royal Mail.  Royal Mail give them blocks of Tracking Numbers.  You buy a season ticket from West Middlands Trains and they send you an email saying the ticket has been issued along with a Tracking Number.  Here's the scam ... they haven't actually posted it and don't for many days/weeks after.  It looks like Royal Mail are at fault because they've given you a tracking number.  This allows West Midlands Trains to violate thier terms and conditions and you will probably have to buy daily tickets until your season ticket arrives.  These of course, will not be refunded.",

It was so packed you couldn't move, at each stop the alarms would go off and we were told to stop messing about or the driver was walking off, pretty sure this was a technical fault on the train but it was easier to blame for the poor passengers.  The driver was in such a bad mood, slamming the brakes on the train and flying through  Tyseley so everyone who stood up fell into each other.  No one actually hit the floor as there was no space to do so, no announcements at which station we were at and you couldn't see out of the windows to guess.   Unfortunately i had to get the train again and of course the trains running at peak times are cancelled both in the morning and evening.  Why is this company still allowed to manage the trains in our area.  Absolute disgrace,  I'm going to work from home and save myself the misery of travelling with West Midlands Railway.",

I attempted several times to ensure they had their fare in person and in writing via recorded delivery. \n\nThey offer you a settlement and attempt to blackmail you by using persuasive language in a 'Single Justice Procedure Notice' to help the incident 'go away'; ultimately leaving you with a criminal record. \n \n\nStaff fill out penalty tickets with incorrect details; undisclosed staff members names on penalty tickets. \n\n\nDisproportionate. \nAbuse of Power.",

Today 3rd August 2022 my train to the QE hospital was cancelled because some scum of the earth decided it was a good idea to steal cables serving a signal box. I told Chris who was dealing with the many anxious passengers that I had a date I needed to keep on a radiotherapy machine, and it was imperative I got there. He ordered me a taxi through the companies system but when one wasn't available soon enough he ordered me an Uber out of his own pocket. Thanks Chris I got there on time and the Uber was great. Hopefully you will get reimbursed sooner rather than later. Above and beyond in my opinion. I would add that all the station staff at Cradley are generally polite and helpful.",

Both trips were over sold & had people standing in the aisles so much that people couldn't get to the toilets!!. No air con on, the carriages were very warm, meaning no airflow (not good in the current circumstances). Just felt like they wanted to fill the trains & didn't worry about the safety of the passengers! I will never travel with West midlands trains again. A totally shambolic service provider!!",

Sometimes they\u2019ll even miss out stops due to running late, and announce this poorly and off time. Today I was on a train and someone was ill that an ambulance had to come on, if they are severely ill wouldn\u2019t they be taken off and put in the ambulance so tell me why the train was parked up still for an hour and a bit? It doesn\u2019t make sense, I even refunded my ticket and didn\u2019t get all my money back. I am absolutely sick of this service, it\u2019s not fair to have to explain why your late to college or work all the time it\u2019s ridiculous.",

So I proceeded to buy a ticket for the next train and get on the 16:18 train that was late. Arrived to about 9 police officers and 2 ticket inspectors, and when I explained my reasoning for buying a later ticket, the ticket inspector accused me of lying about coming from alvechurch and that I had only just bought the ticket. I now have to pay a \u00a350 pound fee as I know the appeal service is just tragic. As many people have said on here I wish I could give a 0 star rating",

How is that  allowed to happen and be the norm? This is shocking and shouldn't be accepted. The staff were rude, unapologetic and didnt care, I was told there would be another train in 1hr....that train was also delayed on line which meant I missed my next connecting line. I ended up arriving home 3hrs late. Never again and shame on you West Midlands trains for overselling so badly.",

On our return journey, a lady sat just behind us but on the other side of the carriage and continued to burn/smoke marijuana. The smell was very strong and we were caused to move seats again to as far away as possible. The ULEZ zone for us means our car is not compliant so we took the train for its simplicity, relaxation and enjoyment. Unfortunately the carriage smelt, and there were no officials who to which we could have to brought these events to the attention of. Very disappointed. If we are going to be charged for taking our vehicles in to the ultra emission zone, then at least make the alternative mode of transport safe and more appealing.

        "review_text": "Im gonna be completely honest but, i don't understand why alot of these reviews are 1 star. Today i went on the Birmingham NS to Hereford service and wow. First of all the bike spaces on this train are incredible, they make the most use of space such as stowing the accessible ramp. The bike spaces are separate to the wheelchair space and can fit up too x3 Bikes! To me this is amazing as you see all these rail companies with tiny bike spaces and hooks. The carriages were at a good temperature and the train is very spacious. Its a quiet service as the trains are usually a good length. You get power sockets with a USB port and a small trey table. The only downside of this is that there are no arm rests. Doing a 1hr 20 journey to Hereford and back can be quite uncomfortable without an armrest but the seats were fairly comfortable for my journey. There are 2 toilets on each set of unit. One thats accessible and one thats a manual sliding open door. Back to the bike storage there are even belts to strap your bike in the space so it cannot fall over when the train is moving. There are also chairs right next to the bike storage all these combined means you do not have to stand with your bike and you can have a stress free journey whilst sitting down and relaxing.",

Should be ideal, with a 10 to 15 minute transition. But no. The train from and to Telford is pretty much always on time, never cancelled, sometimes a couple of minutes late but that doesn't effect my journey. The same cannot be said of West Midlands trains. If they are late or cancelled there goes my connection. I lose an hour of my day several times a week. They face the same manning problems as every other train franchise so why are they effected more? Simple, they were trying to run an operation with fewer staff coverage to maximise their profits and line the owners pockets. Strip them of their franchise and give it to a company prepared to run a half decent service",

        "review_text": "Their trains ran late on the 19th of October 2023. I applied for a refund. It was accepted. They then came back to me asking for my card details that I had already provided them with. I attempted to enter my card details but their system says it does not accept my card. I only have the one card. It is ironical that I can pay them with that card but they cannot issue my refund to the card they took money from. There is no way to get in touch with them. Trying to contact them by phone renders the refund you are trying to claim useless. These sleazebags are a bunch of criminals. They will offer you a refund but to get, you will have to pay to call them and pay more to talk to them than the refund they are offering. They are criminals. It is legalised robbery.",

        "review_text": "Stuck for 1 hour 20 mins on a train with faulty air conditioning and no opening windows on the hottest day of the year. Can't believe it wasn't disembarked and taken out of service. The guard onboard said it was because the AC system failed to reset properly overnight - so am following up with the Government Office for Rail & Road and the HSE to establish whether any potential negligence was involved. If this is a recurrent fault and other trains are being allowed to run in the same condition then their Operator's Licence should be placed under review based on a reading of section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work Act. Have notified two national papers and hope to have more information by the weekend. Any West Midlands employee with information relating to this issue should contact the news desk at the Mirror and ask to speak to the News Editor.",

This required two connections the first being after my west-midlands rail service to Wolverhampton. the first service we were meant to get was canceled, meaning I could not make connections and arrived in London two hours late west midlands rail only refunded 10 pounds out of 70 pounds worth of tickets as their argument was I could have got the next train that came 56 mins later that covered their leg of the journey and did not take into account the other connections I was required to make the trains in this country are an absolute joke and disgrace.",

We spoke to the complaints department who advised he would speak to his manager because of the circumstances and we received a response the next day by email saying they couldn't help with any contributions towards accommodation as it was against there policy. On the phone we were advised why don't we walk around London and try to find a room for \u00a3100 for 2 adults.

        "review_text": "Dreadful service. Trains cancelled in both directions daily along Birmingham to Shrewsbury line. Appalling. I can\u2019t get back from work in Birmingham as I live in Albrighton. Was told my WMR ticket was valid on evening bus services. The last bus from Wolverhampton to Telford at night via Albrighton and Shifnal is at 16:30. Absolutely useless. If all trains are cancelled because of problems such as signalling Transport for Wales put replacement coaches on calling at Wton, Telford and Shrewsbury but WMR do not even bother to put replacement road transport on to Bilbrook, Codsall, Albrighton, Cosford etc. WMR are a disgraceful company who are riding on the back of Transport for Wales expecting TfW to get people back to Wolverhampton and Telford. People are then left to get back to their destinations by taxi or by getting relatives to pick them up. I am sick of paying for taxis from Wton to Albrighton (\u00a322). This WMR services is completely unacceptable. \nThe one Saturday services were cancelled between Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury because of signalling problems. I think a signalman was ill. I waited at Wton for an hour and a half and during that time no fewer than eight coaches came put on by TFW taking people to Telford, Wellington and Shrewsbury. There was not a single coach laid on by WMR to take people to Bilbrook, Codsall, Albrighton, Cosford, Shifnal or Oakengates. I had had a security issue with my debit card earlier in the day and the bank had had to cancel it. I therefore had no means of paying for a taxi. I had to get the staff at  Wolverhampton Railway Station to call me a taxi and charge it to WMR. I have complained to my MP, the Transport Secretary and to the regional mayor, all to no avail. WMR should lose the franchise. I think they are owned by Abelio. Enough said. Abelio run the Caledonian Sleeper and that\u2019s a shambles too.",

On 4 November I went to the Euston ticket office and was served by a blonde lady in her early 30s with a Polish or Central European accent on counter number 4. I asked for an anytime/service day return to Milton Keynes for the day. She said she had processed two single tickets for me instead 'as it was cheaper' at \u00a336.10. I asked what the next train I could get was and she replied the 8.46am train (to Crewe). I then boarded this train. When my tickets were inspected, the lady who gave me the notice told me that my ticket was valid for Avanti West Coast only and this was a Northwestern Railway train. I was then issued with a fine of \u00a340. I was very annoyed as 1. I had initially asked for an any time/service return and 2. I had asked what train I could get on and was told to get on this one by the lady at the ticket office. I appealed, and the penalty was cancelled, but 'I still have to pay \u00a321.50'. Why? I asked for any anytime/service ticket to begin with, and asked what train I could get on next. Because of someone else's mistake, I am now being charged.",

The staff are miserable and if you manage to get someone to answer your question all they say is get a swift card . My question is why sell them to customers as it\u2019s very stressful to have to wait sometimes up to ten minutes not withstanding the staff talking to each other about there personal lives, trying to get their attention and then they look at you as if your an inconvenience for disturbing them . \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve ascertained these Barriers have never worked with the monthly ntrain photocard ticket . If not I will have to switch over to swift card as my friend says their great and you can get through the barriers . \n\nMy question is why can you not use them to get through the barriers what is the problem at least if someone will give me a straight answer I can make a decision based off facts . \n\nThe reason I am delaying getting a swift card is it won\u2019t start till the 17th July but. I don\u2019t mind being inconvenienced as it will be peace of mind for me as it is stressful having to deal with the barrier staff everyday . \n\nMiss Mckeown  \n\n\nUpdate : I went to new street station today to try and sort this out one of the lady\u2019s said to me it must brr Ed a bad batch of tickets . Yeah really for 4 months pull the other one .\nI spoke to 6 different people on the phone number on my railcard incompetent nobody had the answer nobody knows anything what is a customer to do . \nI\u2019ve had it with Ntraind I\u2019ll gladly swap to swift as the new street advisor said as ntrain date CHIT . \n4 months of paying 4 months of no barriers disgusting I am sending this complaint to ac many people as I can even though I am moving to swift you lot have put me through hell and back including the staff who work at new street station I now have ptsd from being treated like chit fir 4 months appalling service .

I got on a train here a few months ago that was waaayy too overcrowded, as they had crowds of people standing up at the doors so they were all blocking the doors, which is a real health and safety hazard if you ask me, and in the aisles. They should simply NOT have been letting more people on when it was already full, something which I am sick of public transport doing, as they seem far more concerned about their money than any health and safety hazard. It was so crowded people were taking ages to get off, having had to get off while the doors were closing, and it was really hard for me, having major anxiety and being highly sensitive, as I ended up having a real meltdown and crying after I got off, with it having really assaulted my nervous system, being very overwhelming and feeling like I couldn\u2019t breathe. This was because there had been 2 cancelled trains, which is ridiculous enough as it is, but the utter lack of control and management here is atrocious and they really need to get their act together by starting to prioritise health and safety and passenger health and well-being over their own money/profits! That goes for most other public transports as well who seem to let infinite people on, not considering the hazardous and health impacts this may have!",

        "review_text": "I recently had an unfortunate encounter with West Midlands Trains and their penalty fare system, as well as the Appeals Service (AS) and IRCAS. The way they handled my case was extremely disappointing and left me feeling frustrated and mistreated.\n\nFirstly, it is clear that the system lacks proper checks and balances. If the validity of my railcard had been verified before issuing the discounted ticket, this entire situation could have been avoided. A simple reminder about the expiration date of the railcard would have prevented me from purchasing the ticket in the first place. It is unfair to penalize passengers who genuinely weren't aware of their railcard's expiration, especially when it only expired a month ago.\n\nSecondly, the penalty fare itself is exorbitant and disproportionate. The price difference between a full-price ticket and a discounted ticket is only \u00a35.50, yet the fine imposed on me is a staggering \u00a379. This level of punishment is unjustifiable, particularly for a student like myself who has limited financial resources. I would have gladly paid the price difference, but the fine imposed is simply unbearable and does not align with the nature of the offense.\n\nAdditionally, despite appealing multiple times and presenting my arguments clearly, the independent panel seemed to completely disregard my concerns and reasoning. The lack of consideration for my circumstances and the failure to address my valid points is both disheartening and unfair. It is disappointing to see the appeals process fall short of providing a fair and just outcome.\n\nOverall, my experience with West Midlands Trains, the Appeals Service, and IRCAS has left me with the impression that these companies prioritize their revenue over fair treatment and customer satisfaction. The disproportionate penalty fare and the dismissal of legitimate appeals only reinforce the perception that they operate like con men and bullies.\n\nI hope that this review draws attention to the need for a more equitable approach to penalty fares and encourages these companies to reevaluate their practices.",

One would think WMR management has not been living in the same world as the rest if us. The train was DISGUSTINGLY dirty. The floors seemed caked in years of grime; the seat back rests where dirty.

She was paying cash and there are no cash facilities at Hemel station other than the ticket desk which at this particular time was being held up by a guy causing chaos. My daughter was worried she was going to be late for college.\nShe was given a penalty fare notice by the ticket inspector who, while on loud speaker, was so rude to not only my daughter but to me aswell! Telling my daughter she was a liar and telling me she\u2019s getting a fine and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. I have a letter from the staff in Hemel station confirming they instructed my daughter to get on the train without a ticket and the copy of the return ticket she paid for at her destination point which effectively paid for her 2 journeys but the ticket was then obviously only valid for one more journey to come home!. \nTrying to appeal the penalty in itself has been a nightmare, you can not actually speak to a human!. After numerous emails, calling numbers on the penalty fare notice (which aren\u2019t even the correct numbers), attempting to submit an appeal via the penalty service website with no luck and going back and forth I eventually got given an email address to send my appeal to. \nI received a letter saying UNLESS ALREADY PAID the charge of \u00a35.90 for the journey was to be paid, otherwise the appeal was successful and no further action needed. \nWell as my daughter paid for the 2 journeys she needed for that day there was no reason for me to pay the \u00a35.90! \nI then receive a letter from IRCAS (which wasn\u2019t even sent to my address but our postman clearly realised that was an error and delivered it to me) demanding \u00a340.90p as I hadn\u2019t paid the \u00a35.90 within 14 days. I emailed them explaining the full amount was already paid on the day only to get a reply saying I need to re-appeal to penalty service but that the \u00a340.90p won\u2019t be put on hold while I do this so I still owe it!\nAbsolutely disgusting service! You can\u2019t possibly speak to anybody about it, had I not spent the time digging around to get an email address there would be no other options on phone lines or letters than to pay money I didn\u2019t owe!. This is an ongoing matter but I refuse to accept responsibility for the actions caused by a member of West Midlands staff and I also refuse to pay IRCAS \u00a340.90p when the full train fare was paid on the day already and the penalty service can\u2019t check supporting documents properly in the first place!",

        "review_text": "Appalling service, London Midland was a better service and that is saying a lot. WMR cross-city line cannot cope with the passenger load due to small carriages (3 instead of 6 at rush hour 8am, London Midland had a 6 carriage service at this time), lack of staff, 'operational issues' and a timetable which they do not have the infrastructure to uphold. This week (commencing 13JAN20) I have taken a return journey on my daily commute, 8 journeys and 7 of those were behind schedule ranging from 5-15 minutes. This means alot of the trains are backed up and on two seperate days I had to watch as 2 trains passed by without any room to get on, needless to say a 5 mile, 10 minute train journey took me an hour to complete and I was late for work on 2 occasions. I'm glad that Andy Street has threatened these guys with losing the franchise as they are not fit for purpose, London Midland were awful, these guys are atrocious!",

Yes I think it might be all of them things to be honest, absolutely disgusting company and hope they get the franchise removed end of Jan.\nThanks WMR for making me late on a regular occurence to work and making me late for child care, oh and not responding to any complaint so I look forward to the Rail Ombudsman stepping in to help.\nUSELESS AND DISGRACEFUL COMPANY",

Well, it isn't rocket science is it - if you consistently have a shortage of crew, you need more staff.  If you don't have sufficient staff to maintain the timetable, then why did you bid for the work, and why were you successful??  The service is a joke.  Instead of investing loads of money in new trains (which yes, would be nice) why not spend some money on getting the ones you have running properly first.  It is madness to think you have to aim for a train which is at least 3 in advance of the train you actually need because you can't guarantee that there won't be cancellations.  I have never been so disappointed in any train service.  Sort it out please.",

People by the doors don't want to get off the train to allow everyone else to shuffle out the way of the odd person trying to depart. I understand why as they can't always get back on in the mad scrum when people trying to board the train can see most of them aren't going to get on. I've commuted with a season ticket for 10 years and this is the worst its ever been. I dread the journey so much that I'm actually considering leaving a job I love just to escape the journeys from hell. Sick of hearing about the carriages that are coming in 2020.

I travel from Worcester to Birmingham from Monday to Friday. \n\nIn this short space of time I have already seriously considered giving up a job that is otherwise perfect purely because of this appalling train service. \n\nThe journey in to work (8.24am) is generally ok for me. There have been few delays and I usually get a seat. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for passengers getting on a few stops further down the line - they are guaranteed to be standing every day as there are simply not enough carriages. \n\nThe journey home has been nothing short of a nightmare right from the start. Trains are regularly delayed, too full to board or cancelled altogether at short notice. A classic example was 5/12/19, in which 3 of my trains in a row were cancelled. When the first train to run again finally arrived (with only 3 carriages), it was so horrifically cramped that the majority of passengers were not able to board and were left standing on the platform. If the previous 3 trains had been cancelled, could more carriages not have been added onto this train? In addition to the normal passengers for this train, a later Bromsgrove train was also cancelled meaning passengers for said train were also having to board ours. How cramped this train was was utterly inhumane and this is far from a one off occurrence. \n\nIn the time I have been commuting I have managed to get a seat on the train home twice. Standing, in carriages so full you don't even have room to wriggle out of your coat, is the norm but by this point you are simply feeling lucky that you even managed to board at all. Every day whilst at work I am constantly worrying about the state of the trains home, anxiously checking and rechecking whether they have been cancelled yet and wondering if I will actually make it home tonight. \n\nAnd the best part? We are all paying a small fortune for the privilege of enduring this circus every day. Something drastically needs to be done and it needs to be done NOW.",

They have the audacity to start charging for car parking in village stations run by pirate parking companies, issuing fines without any remorse. Customers are becoming increasing fed up with appalling quality of service. Company Directors need to be held publicly accountable for their woeful incompetence and inadequacy. All this in the face of news that fares are due to increase in 2020. WMR are just laughing in the face of their customers.",

Mr Camp\u2019s interview was padded out with waffle and no amount of words or excuses can redeem this totally shambolic company. Thank God my scooter is repaired as of tomorrow. I feel very sorry for those who have to tolerate this third world service on a daily basis and pay for their season tickets. Mr Camp made no mention of offering customers their money back.

We're on shorter trains, which are more overcrowded and therefore run late every day.\n\nSome new carriages have been introduced, but they seem to have a poorer seating pattern than the outgoing ones. Not that you're getting a seat anyway, it's standing room only - if you can actually get on the train. They're frequently so full you're left standing on the platform.\n\nNo sign of the long-promised 6 coach trains. Every train is a heaving hulk of compressed, angry human flesh.\n\nThey've adopted all the worst practices of London Midland, and found innovative ways to make it worse. The cross-city line is under permanent and lasting decline under this operator.\n\nRoll on nationalisation!",

This resulted in the next train - 10 minutes later - being overcrowded so couldn't get on this one and, 10 minutes later, I just managed to cram myself on to the 3rd train. No explanation for lack of carriages and their mess-ups happen every day with stupid excuses like \"too many passengers\" - hint, put more carriages on, \"no train crew\" - hint, cut your bonuses and hire more people.

The excuse they use, is that it is done to stop delays to trains running behind that train.  That is total rubbish, as those later trains are delayed anyway.  If there was a train immediately behind it, they would have a point.   \n\nThe people running WM Trains must be backward, and the general opinion is that London Midland were far superior,  and London Midland were not exactly the best, but at least if a train was running let, you could still board it and get to your destination.  \n\nThey respond to complaints by saying you can claim for compensation using their delay repay scheme.

West Midlands Railway is the most inept, incompetent and awful service provider in recent memory. Firstly let me just say that sometimes problems occur with transport services that sometimes is out of their hands. However in that case the company should do the best they can to sort them and have a pro-active approach to problem resolution. WMR have never had this and fall apart at the slightest hint of an issue. Trains are cancelled at the drop of a hat, often-times with no explanation given. Train cancellations because of a shortage of crew members has become an almost-daily occurrence, but little is being done to solve these issues because they keep occurring. Forget about new payment machines and paintwork for the carriages, why not invest in staffing levels and infrastructure which will improve a woeful service. Why are the chieftains of this company not doing anything to alleviate the shocking service levels. I pay monthly for my train pass. lateness has become so common-place that I think I am now desensitised to it. When London Midland let you down it was actually for a valid reason, their service was so much better than WMR. If we have a cold winter this season they will be in absolute disarray and monthly pass holders like me will be walking home.",

        "review_text": "Booked my tickets 3 weeks in advance, however ny mistake I had selected the wrong railcard. And 2 weeks before my journey I had realised so I contacted them to try and amend the tickets. But was told they couldn't be amended, instead I had to take a refund, BUT there was a \u00a310 cancellation fee. My tickets only cost \u00a315 in the first place, and I still wanted/ needed the tickets, and even with the correct railcard applied the ticket price was still exactly the same. But now I have no ticket, and I'm \u00a310 out of pocket just because someone couldnt/ wouldnt change one detail on my ticket. It's absolutely ridiculous and I refuse to believe that it couldnt have been amended. I wadnt given any apology, just a cold matter of fact tone, a kind of if you dont like it then it's tough. I would have either have to spend the \u00a315 again on the same tickets with the correct railcard, or accept the \u00a35 refund and rebook the tickets.",

        "review_text": "General poor service on the Birmingham to Lichfield cross city line every evening. Rammed, overcrowded trains that have never been extended as promised. \n\nPoor operational decisions to terminate and turn around trains before Lichfield often lead to extended delays for Lichfield passengers.\n\nThis company has not learned from thet shortcomings of its predecessor; rather, it has repeated their mistakes with a big silly grin and added many of their own.\n\nAn enormous opportunity for improvement missed.\n\nUpdate: This has only gotten worse.\n\nTheir service over the autumn/winter period was, frankly, horrific. Many occaisions when trains weren't running at all, or with severe delay.\n\nOne experience that really stood out was when I was trying to get back to Lichfield Trent Valley, *five* successive trains had a problem or another. They even managed to smack one of them into the barriers as a bonus mistake. Train then took 5 minutes to get moving.\n\nBack to work in the new year, day 1 in the office and there are two train cancellations in a row. 3 weeks into January and it's pretty much \"delay repay every day\" territory.\n\nWhen you review their performance data offered online, they are typically the cause of their own problems, as opposed to National Rail / other operators.\n\nI can only conclude that they are unable, unwilling or simply incapable of running the service. The cross-city line seems in terminal decline. Lichfield Trent Valley passengers in particulary are treated with contempt, as if it's an optional treat for us to get home. \n\nRecently had numerous rush-hour trains called (0820, 0840) from trent valley. They send a 6-person taxi as an alternative. 28 people left waiting. Most just trekked down to city on foot.\n\nStrip the franchise!",
